You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: long-term benefits, long-term planning and announcements
Relationship: Inclusion (long-term benefits are part of long-term planning and announcements)
Criteria: Designer communicates long-term benefits or plans of a feature or development to the community.
Label: Long-term Vision Sharing

2.
Concepts: collaborative planning, future development ideas and discussions
Relationship: Intersection (collaborative planning involves discussing future development ideas)
Criteria: Designers and users engage in collaborative discussions about future development plans or ideas.
Label: Collaborative Development Planning

3.
Concepts: community expertise recognition, community and expert consultation
Relationship: Parallel (recognizing community expertise and consulting with experts are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Designer acknowledges community expertise or seeks input from experts, teachers, or the community.
Label: Expertise Valuation and Consultation

4.
Concepts: community involvement, acknowledging community needs
Relationship: Inclusion (acknowledging community needs is part of community involvement)
Criteria: Designer involves the community in development or responds to their needs and concerns.
Label: Community-Centered Development

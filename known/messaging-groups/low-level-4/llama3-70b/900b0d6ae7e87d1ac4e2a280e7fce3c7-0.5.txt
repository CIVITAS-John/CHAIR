You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 seeks help with uploading a high definition avatar; citing censorship concerns
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: user 4229 inquires about a pc version; possibly referring to the platform or a specific feature
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 responds to user 4229; offering to upload a file and asking about their profession
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: user 4229 identifies as a teacher
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: 
In this initial round of coding, I plan to focus on identifying the key themes and concepts that emerge from the conversation. I'll be looking for indicators of how the online community is taking shape, such as how designers and users interact, what topics are being discussed, and what needs and concerns are being expressed. From a learning sciences perspective, I'll be interested in how users are engaging with the platform and what kinds of learning experiences are being envisioned. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll be looking at how users are navigating the platform and what kinds of features and functionalities are being requested. From a participatory design perspective, I'll be examining how designers are engaging with users and how user feedback is being incorporated into the design process.

Summary: 
This conversation appears to be taking place in an online community centered around the development of Physics Lab. Designers and users are interacting, with designers sharing information about the development plan and soliciting feedback. Users are expressing their needs and concerns, including requests for specific features and functionalities. The conversation is focused on the development of the platform, with designers and users working together to shape its direction.

Notes: 
Some initial hypotheses based on this conversation include: (1) the online community is likely to play a key role in shaping the development of Physics Lab; (2) users are likely to be active participants in the design process; and (3) the designers are committed to incorporating user feedback into the development process. Further analysis is needed to explore these hypotheses and uncover additional themes and patterns in the data.

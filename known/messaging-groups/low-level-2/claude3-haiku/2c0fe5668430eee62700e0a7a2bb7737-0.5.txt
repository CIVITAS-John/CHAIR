You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P8: [Image]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

Thoughts: The conversation seems to be about uploading and sharing images, possibly for educational or professional purposes. The participants appear to be discussing technical aspects of image sharing, as well as the context of use (e.g., whether it's for a PC version or for a teacher). I will focus on identifying tags related to the social interactions and community dynamics in this exchange.
Analysis for all 5 messages:

1. image-upload; image-sharing
2. image-quality; image-watermark; image-upload-request; user-interaction
3. platform-specific; clarification-seeking
4. image-upload; user-role-inquiry
5. user-role-confirmation

Summary: The conversation starts with a user (P8) sharing an image, which prompts another user (Designer) to ask how to upload a high-resolution image without a watermark. The conversation then shifts to clarifying whether the image is for a PC version, and the Designer inquires if the other user (P4229) is a teacher. P4229 confirms that they are a teacher.

Notes: The conversation suggests an active community where users are engaged in technical discussions and information-sharing related to image upload and use. The participants seem to be interested in understanding the context of use and each other's roles, indicating a sense of community and collaboration. The open coding tags reflect the social interactions and community dynamics, such as user requests, clarifications, and role identifications.

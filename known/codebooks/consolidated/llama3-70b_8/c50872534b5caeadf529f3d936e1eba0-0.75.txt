You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: ai query, ai interaction
- The participant asks AI a question or requests assistance with a specific task.
- Interacting with AI, asking questions, or seeking help from AI.

2.
Concepts: exploring ai capabilities, experiments with ai queries
- Participants explore AI's capabilities, questioning its limitations.
- Participants experimentally test AI capabilities and limitations.

3.
Concepts: valuing ai's error clarification, appreciating clear ai explanations
- Participants appreciate AI's error detection and clarification capabilities that provide clear explanations.
- Participants appreciate clear and comprehensible AI responses that provide parameter clarification.

4.
Concepts: viewing ai as a collaborator, imagines ai as a pair programmer
- Participants consider AI as a potential collaborator or peer programmer.
- Participants imagine AI as a collaborative programmer that provides feedback.

5.
Concepts: evaluating ai-generated code, compares ai-generated code
- Participants read and evaluate AI-generated code in detail.
- Participants compare AI-generated code to human-written code to evaluate differences.

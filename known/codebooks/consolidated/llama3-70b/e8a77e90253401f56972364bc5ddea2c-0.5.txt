You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: designer appreciation, designer engagement
- Expression of gratitude or appreciation towards the designer or platform.
- The designer expresses interest or enthusiasm for a particular aspect of the platform or its features.

2.
Concepts: user-centric design, user-centered design
- The designer prioritizes user-centric design principles or user feedback.
- Designer considers user experience when designing the platform or its features.

3.
Concepts: physical digital integration, component integration
- Discussions revolve around integrating physical and digital components.
- The integration or combination of components is discussed, and user discusses integrating technology with the platform.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: designer appreciation, designer engagement
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts describe the designer's positive attitude towards the platform)
Criteria: The designer expresses gratitude or enthusiasm towards the platform or its features.
Label: Designer Affinity

2.
Concepts: user-centric design, user-centered design
Relationship: Inclusion (user-centered design is a principle that prioritizes user-centric design)
Criteria: The designer prioritizes user experience and feedback when designing the platform or its features.
Label: User-Centric Approach

3.
Concepts: physical digital integration, component integration
Relationship: Intersection (both concepts describe the integration of different components or technologies)
Criteria: Discussions revolve around combining physical and digital components or integrating technology with the platform.
Label: Integration of Components

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: acknowledged usability challenge
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

2.
Label: offer support based on feedback

4.
Label: update on review status
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

5.
Label: set timeline for mechanics
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

6.

7.
Label: express need for documentation
Quotes:
- User: Is there a user manual?

8.
Label: propose detailed suggestions
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

9.
Label: requested suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

10.
Label: acknowledge finding information
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

11.
Label: engage in the discussion about technical specifications

- User: PC version?

12.
Label: set scope for experiments
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

13.
Label: maintain polite communication
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

14.
Label: provide status update

- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

15.
Label: communicate design philosophy
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

16.
Label: address diverse user needs in software design
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

17.
Label: designer 1 acknowledges potential issue
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

18.
Label: inform users about changes in component specifications
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

Label: explain practical applications of software
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

20.
Label: offer workaround
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

21.
Label: seek input from educators about circuit diagram standards
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

25.
Label: explain educational focus
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

30.
Label: request assistance with avatar customization
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

31.
Label: designer 1 inquires about user's profession
Quotes:

32.
Label: product gap
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

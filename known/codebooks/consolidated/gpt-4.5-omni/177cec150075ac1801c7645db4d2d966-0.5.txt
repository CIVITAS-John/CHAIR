You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

1. soliciting feedback, feedback incorporation.
- Instances where designers or developers ask for user suggestions and feedback.
- Instances where user feedback influences design decisions and software development.

2. user inquiry, user requests.
- Instances where users ask questions to gain information or clarify doubts.
- Instances where users make specific requests or suggestions for new features or content.

3. peer support, peer assistance and information sharing.
- Instances where users provide assistance or encouragement to each other.
- Community members helping each other with information and resources.

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. soliciting feedback, feedback incorporation.
Relationship: These concepts are sequential; soliciting feedback naturally leads to feedback incorporation.
Criteria: Instances where user feedback is actively sought and subsequently used to influence design decisions and software development.
Label: User Feedback Integration
Category: Design Iteration

2. user inquiry, user requests.
Relationship: These concepts are parallel; both involve users seeking information or making requests.
Criteria: Instances where users ask questions or make specific requests for new features or content to gain information or clarify doubts.
Label: User Queries and Requests
Category: User Engagement

3. peer support, peer assistance and information sharing.
Relationship: These concepts are parallel; both involve community members helping each other.
Criteria: Instances where users provide assistance, encouragement, or share information and resources with each other.
Label: Peer Support and Sharing

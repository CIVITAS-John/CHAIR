Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P14: How do you say it?
2. P14: [Image 1-299]
3. P17: Brain King.
4. P18: By the way, how to use it?
5. P18: Just downloaded.
6. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10
7. P6: When will it be updated?
8. P20: Why does that fuse keep blowing?

* Summary
This conversation involves multiple participants discussing an app or software called "Brain King". P14 shares an image and asks how to say the name. P17 provides the name "Brain King". P18 asks how to use the app after downloading it. P19 shares a URL, possibly related to the app. P6 asks when the app will be updated, and P20 asks an unrelated question about a fuse blowing.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can explore the following aspects:

1. Learning dynamics: How are participants sharing knowledge and learning from each other about the app? Are there any instances of peer learning or collaborative problem-solving?

2. User experience: How do participants express their experiences with the app, including usability issues, feature requests, or confusion about its functionality?

3. Community formation: How do participants engage with each other, establish norms, and build a sense of community around the app?

4. Participatory design: Are there any instances where participants suggest improvements or modifications to the app, contributing to its design and development?

1.
Label: describes unhelpful feedback
Quotes:
- E01: I think a lot of people, because they're very subtle, and then the error message is no help whatsoever to the user. You're, you're adding two variables over here and it's complaining about something over there. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's error messages could be unhelpful.

2.
Label: lists multiple languages
Quotes:

3.
Label: recognizes the importance of tailored support
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

4.
Label: values ai support for beginners
Quotes:
- E04: It includes debugging, it is actually trying to incorporate like a unit test, which is really cool and really helpful, especially for beginners, because they can kind of, you know, check their inputs. Beginners, everyone really. They can debug their code appropriately. (interviewer's observation) Debugging capability.

5.
Label: seeks personalized starting points
Quotes:
- E01: I cannot learn like that. I'm sorry. I am not a top left first page to last page. So if AI can help find a good place to start and manage that learning process, then I think that's astounding. (interviewer's observation) Critique on the existing situation of technical documentation and imagine that AI could improve the learning process.

6.
Label: emphasizes the gaps in documented information
Quotes:
- E01: So my observation is that a critical, critical 10%, maybe more, maybe a lot more of knowledge that you need to do your job in software is only contained in oral tradition.

7.
Label: mentions long history with various languages
Quotes:
- E01: I started programming in 1964 at IBM. ... And since then I have programmed in production code in at least 20 different software languages. (interviewer's observation) E01's prior experiences in computer programming in general.

8.
Label: recognizes support for all users
Quotes:
- E04: It includes debugging, it is actually trying to incorporate like a unit test, which is really cool and really helpful, especially for beginners, because they can kind of, you know, check their inputs.

10.
Label: reflects on the benefits of collaboration
Quotes:
- E01: This is what conversations with ChatGPT typically look like. I had to go through about eight separate times to get all the errors out of it.  But, but look at how it structured the code.

(interviewer's observation) Users may benefit from the iterative debugging process during working with AI, even though AI might give wrong answers.

11.
Label: discusses customized documentation
Quotes:
- E01: And you want doctors to use it, nurses to use it and medical transcriptionists to use it. They use a different word for whatever the verb for whatever it is you're saying you want them to do. And so, in some sense, their documentation has to be customized to their context to their user group. ... It's a language system. If you have a learning system that's actually capable of harvesting information, yeah, and a lot of them are not yet, but I think we'll get there.

So in some sense that you might just be better off, just pretend it's not a computer. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how he interacts with ChatGPT like a person.

14.
Label: experiences variability in ai outputs
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that.

(interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

15.
Label: recounts an experience of ai generating non existent functions

- E01: And then very often, it could.  (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could often resolve errors by itself.

18.
Label: encounters outdated functions
Quotes:

24.
Label: requests ai verification
Quotes:
- E01: "can you verify that no more names are reserved words in NetLogo?" I don't know if it can do that. (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug after the third iteration, he asks ChatGPT to verify the code and produce no more bug. Unsure if it could do that.

27.
Label: reflect on human like interaction
Quotes:
- E01: I speak to (ChatGPT) like a person. I could just walk in the room and go write me code that does X, but I don't, I start with good morning.

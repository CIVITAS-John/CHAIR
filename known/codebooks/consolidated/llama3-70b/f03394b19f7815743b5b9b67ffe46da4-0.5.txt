1.
Label: uses task to evaluate ai's understanding
Quotes:
- E01: "please write a netlogo program that produces a checker board with black and white squares?" (interviewer's observation) E01 asks ChatLogo to create a checkerboard pattern.
- E01: So let's say "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square." (interviewer's observation) E01's first task.

2.
Label: expressing need for time to adapt
Quotes:
- E04: Part of the issue that I'm having now is just kind of like the learning curve, just trying to figure out how everything works. (interviewer's observation) E04 mentions a learning curve, likely because our current design is not fine-tuned for experts.

3.
Label: suggests ai assisted help posts
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.

4.
Label: pondering aiâ€™s verification capacity
Quotes:
- E01: "can you verify that no more names are reserved words in NetLogo?" I don't know if it can do that. (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug after the third iteration, he asks ChatGPT to verify the code and produce no more bug. Unsure if it could do that.

Label: demonstrating thoughtful interaction with ai
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a simple perception" (interviewer's observation) Thinks a bit about whether to use "in NetLogo" or not.

6.
Label: expresses satisfaction
Quotes:
- E01: I want to do this in visual basic... So I made a spreadsheet and I asked ChatGPT, how do you do this? And it wrote the code and the code worked out of the box. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT helped with a VBA task out of the box before.
- E01: And then very often, it could.  (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could often resolve errors by itself.

7.
Label: tech's ability: autocomplete
Quotes:
- E01: And I got to admit like these days, NetLogo is the only language I use that does not have a smart editor. It doesn't autocomplete it or give me options of these are five variables that begin with those three letters. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's lack of smart code editors (we have one in TU that he would later see).

8.
Label: illustrating iterative problem solving
Quotes:
- E01: I have I found with with playing with with ChatGPT. And I was something at Python, I think I tried to give it the code. And I tried to run it generated error. And then I would go back to the next prompt and ChatGPT. And I go, that code is good. But it generates the following error. And I list the error online on this line, and I'd quote the line. And I say, Can you fix that?  (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug in the generated code, he refers to his previous practice with asking ChatGPT to debug with the code, the error message, and the line number. Interviewer did what E01 said.

9.
Label: highlights cultural barriers
Quotes:
- E01: What you have in America is this, this cult of individualism to a point of obsession. And people don't naturally stop and go, how can I get help with this? (interviewer's observation) Continued: reflection on the individualism.

- E01: I think a lot of people, because they're very subtle, and then the error message is no help whatsoever to the user. You're, you're adding two variables over here and it's complaining about something over there. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's error messages could be unhelpful.

12.
Label: describing human ai collaborative productivity
Quotes:
- E01: I call it hive feedback system, where if anyone in the world learns a new fact, or like, Oh, if you're a nurse, here's the word. If you're a transcriptionist, here's the word. If anybody learns it, then it goes into the system into the cloud. And now the cloud won't make that mistake anymore. And then the developer doesn't have to solve all these problems, because all the users solve their own problems. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how the human-AI collaborative system could be used to increase general productivity.

13.
Label: critiques improper help requests
Quotes:
- E01: if you approach the user group politely, graciously, and instead of dropping your entire code on it, you go, I narrowed it down to this. I read this documentation. I tried these eight things with this answer and I'm perplexed. If somebody goes, they paste their problem and it's clearly their homework and they want someone else to do it for them. No, I'm not going to help with that. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on proper practices to seek online help: do your own work and clearly describe what you need/tried.

14.
Label: finds interface helpful
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

15.
Label: mentions ai errors
Quotes:
- E01: So maybe the details are wrong and, you know, Michael Tamalo or somebody jumped on me because I posted some answer and it used some function that wasn't available. AI had hallucinated some function. (interviewer's observation) AI might hallucinates.

16.
Label: describes ai's ability to infer needs
Quotes:
- E01: Well, I cut the entire user's question. It figured out what I wanted. I didn't even tell it what I wanted. It just told me. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could infer E01's need from the input context.

17.
Label: abandons ai when results are repetitive

18.
Label: seeks clarity on ai's potential
Quotes:
- E04: So if I can talk to it in NetLogo, does that mean I could give it in the logo command and then it would like turn that into code on the backend or? (interviewer's observation) Initial confusion over what the system could do.

19.
Label: highlighting human judgment
Quotes:
- E01: I think the key is to not replace human judgment and ability, but to find a fast way to increase human capability and judgment. (interviewer's observation) Augmentation of human capabilities & building on human judgement. Subjectivity of humanity?

22.
Label: summarizing and evaluating generated code
Quotes:
- E01: So set up, move the turtle to go. Increase the size of the turtle by two units. Oh, dear. It's, it's making the turtle bigger.

(interviewer's observation) E01 reads the code and comments, summarizing the code, and thinks about how the AI was understanding the request.

23.
Label: highlights missing skills
Quotes:
- E01: In terms of learning experiences, like ramping up to using an assistant wrapping up to using ChatGPT might have some sort of evaluates. How well can you write instructions for another person? Some people just don't know how to conceptualize a problem. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how "writing instructions" is a capability that is missing on many people, and that is key to work with AI.

24.
Label: moves on after unsatisfactory ai interactions

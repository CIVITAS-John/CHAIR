You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; community engagement; feedback
2. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
Preliminary tags: pc version download; inquiry; software accessibility
3. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
Preliminary tags: pc version download; feedback; software accessibility
4. Designer: [Image 14]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary tags: component update; simulation adjustments; electrical circuits
6. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.
Preliminary tags: component update; electrical circuits; lab equipment
7. Designer: Okay. Please give me more suggestions!
8. P4232: How to use the PC version?
9. P4232: [Image 19]
10. P8: It does not support the XP system.

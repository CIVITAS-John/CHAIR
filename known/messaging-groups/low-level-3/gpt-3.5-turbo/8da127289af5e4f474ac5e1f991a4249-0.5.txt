You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community delves into technical discussions about motor simulations, software customization, and the balance between simplicity and accuracy in design. Participants seek guidance, share knowledge, and explore the complexities of different motor types and their connections to power sources. The dialogue reflects a collaborative learning environment where users exchange technical details, seek advice, and engage in light-hearted interactions, contributing to a positive and supportive community atmosphere.
1. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
Preliminary tags: technical advice
2. P14: [Image 168]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
3. P2: Has it been burned?
Preliminary tags: technical inquiry
4. P4: Just play a rotating animation if you turn on the power, that's it 23333.
5. P2: Do we still need algorithms?
6. P4: 2333, it's simple.
7. P2: Algorithms are not simple.
8. P2: IGDT can also add @Designer 
9. P13: [Image 175]
10. P13: Are you all fake?
11. P13: Are you from outer space?
12. P13: I don't understand.
13. P2: Transistors can also be used.
14. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do normal experiments like this...
15. P11: 233 is in electronic circuits.
16. P11: I don't understand either.
17. P2: In the CPU.

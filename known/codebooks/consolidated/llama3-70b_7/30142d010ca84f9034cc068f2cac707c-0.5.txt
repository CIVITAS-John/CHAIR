You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: demonstrating deep understanding of net logo
Quotes:
- E04: Interesting because it's trying to plot the name, which I know is wrong, but I'm just trying to remember how to... (interviewer's observation) E04 reasons through the responses of ChatGPT.

2.
Label: ai can limit options & points to different  sometimes wrong  directions
Quotes:
- E01: Well, I cut the entire user's question. It figured out what I wanted. I didn't even tell it what I wanted. It just told me. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could infer E01's need from the input context.

3.
Label: using ai to adapt existing code
Quotes:
- E04: "Can train-perceptron be turned into a reporter" (interviewer's observation) E04 uses "can you fix with my own idea".

4.
Label: chat gpt's ability to resolve errors
Quotes:
- E01: And then very often, it could.  (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could often resolve errors by itself.

5.
Label: focusing on fixing the problem
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 chooses to fix the problem rather than showing the explanation.

6.
Label: shares debugging experience
Quotes:
- E01: I have I found with with playing with with ChatGPT. And I was something at Python, I think I tried to give it the code. And I tried to run it generated error. And then I would go back to the next prompt and ChatGPT. And I go, that code is good. But it generates the following error. And I list the error online on this line, and I'd quote the line. And I say, Can you fix that?  (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug in the generated code, he refers to his previous practice with asking ChatGPT to debug with the code, the error message, and the line number. Interviewer did what E01 said.

7.
Label: asking for plotting guidance
Quotes:
- E04: "how can I plot the output of this model?" (interviewer's observation) E04 was prompted to follow-up with ChatGPT.

8.
Label: emphasizing the need for expertise to understand and fix errors in the ai generated code
Quotes:
- E04: To me, it seems like you need to have a certain degree of expertise to understand where the errors are and how to fix them. Because otherwise it's like you're going down this path where you're blindly following the ChatGPT and you have no idea what's going on. For less experienced people, I wouldn't like that because it could put you in a worse situation. (interviewer's observation) Requires expertise to understand errors and debug them. Risks to blindly follow ChatGPT, esp. for less experienced people.

9.
Label: desiring more control over ai interaction
Quotes:
- E04: So, I guess that's kind of annoying because I didn't really want it to explain here, but that was the only option that I had. (interviewer's observation) E04 wants the "fix" option right after the errors are identified.

10.
Label: highlights efficiency
Quotes:
- E01: I'm an advocate of peer programming. It's about 10 times more efficient than single programming... If a person's programming, if you're programming it by yourself and you come to something you don't understand, you could spend a long time at that stoplight. (interviewer's observation) E01's positive opinions on peer programming with a hint that AI could play the role.

11.
Label: appreciating inclusion of unit tests
Quotes:
- E04: It includes debugging, it is actually trying to incorporate like a unit test, which is really cool and really helpful, especially for beginners, because they can kind of, you know, check their inputs.

12.
Label: limited ai capabilities
Quotes:
- E01: It's about, let's see, what did I count is 3800 lines of code. Well, first I couldn't feed it all the ChatGPT can only take it 1800 lines at a time.

13.
Label: prioritizing user experience
Quotes:
- E01: So I would find it more helpful if it asked the questions one at a time. Before you tell me nine more errors. Just because users are always overfilling their buffer. So smaller requests work better. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests (for novice) only showing one error at a time in the AI-driven system.

14.
Label: values error detection
Quotes:
- E01: I don't know how much it understands about all of the efficiencies of NetLogo... But it (could) catch obvious errors that are not obvious to me.

15.
Label: chat gpt helped with a vba task out of the box before
Quotes:
- E01: I want to do this in visual basic... So I made a spreadsheet and I asked ChatGPT, how do you do this? And it wrote the code and the code worked out of the box. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT helped with a VBA task out of the box before.

16.
Label: beginners writing large chunks of code and struggling to fix errors
Quotes:

17.
Label: recognizing the need for guidance
Quotes:
- E01: I'm not sure that any beginner wouldn't necessarily know that unless they'd ever practiced. And so some of the users of NetLogo have never programmed anything. So, (they might lack) the whole concept of debugging or maybe starting with a design outline. They start typing and then they get frustrated because they don't know how to debug code. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how novices might get stuck during the human-AI collaboration process.

18.

Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 reads error messages before making a choice.

Quotes:
- E04: (Throughout this phase. He uses generated code only for reference when writing his own.) (interviewer's observation) E04 writes code manually with the steps given by ChatGPT, rather than copy & paste code.

23.
Label: human-ai (negative): human still need to double-check ai's suggestion
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

24.
Label: chatgpt ability (negative): limitation in reading long codes
Quotes:
- E01: It's about, let's see, what did I count is 3800 lines of code. Well, first I couldn't feed it all the ChatGPT can only take it 1800 lines at a time. And then I said, you know, can you tell me what this does? And it basically said, no. ... I can live with that again. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT's limitation on reading long code pieces.

25.
Label: demonstrating user interaction with ai tool
Quotes:

27.
Label: compares to other languages
Quotes:
- E01: And I got to admit like these days, NetLogo is the only language I use that does not have a smart editor. It doesn't autocomplete it or give me options of these are five variables that begin with those three letters. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's lack of smart code editors (we have one in TU that he would later see).

28.
Label: human-effort (negative): more time to explore
Quotes:
- E04: And it could take a lot of time to like search the documentation and go online and try and figure out all those answers and just to have it like right there. So you can kind of stay within the task is really nice. (interviewer's observation) The capability to search for documentation and read it inside the workspace: esp. beneficial for novices.

29.
Label: critical thinking in ai interactions
Quotes:
- E04: Interesting because it's trying to plot the name, which I know is wrong, but I'm just trying to remember how to... (interviewer's observation) E04 reasons through the responses of ChatGPT.

31.
Label: recognizing the importance of oral tradition in knowledge transmission
Quotes:
- E01: So my observation is that a critical, critical 10%, maybe more, maybe a lot more of knowledge that you need to do your job in software is only contained in oral tradition. It's, it is not documented anywhere.  (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on knowledge in pieces - how they are generated and sustained.

32.
Label: saving time for learning extensions
Quotes:
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time. (interviewer's observation) AI could potentially save time for learning new extensions (compared with core concepts) of NetLogo.

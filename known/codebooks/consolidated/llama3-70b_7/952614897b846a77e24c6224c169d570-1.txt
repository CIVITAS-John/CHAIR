You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: seeking ai syntax support, seeking visualization support
- Users seek AI assistance for syntax support and guidance.
- Users seek help with model output and visualization support from AI.

2.
Concepts: appreciating clear explanations, appreciate parameter clarification support
- Users appreciate clear and easy-to-understand explanations from AI and humans.
- Users find it helpful when the interface allows for clarifying parameters and appreciate AI-provided clarification on parameters.

3.
Concepts: identifying ai limitations
- Users identify AI limitations, such as getting stuck in loops.
- Users identify limitations of LLM-driven interfaces and AI input capabilities.

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: seeking ai syntax support, seeking visualization support
Relationship: The two concepts are related in that they both involve seeking AI assistance, but for different purposes (syntax support and visualization support).
Criteria: Users seek AI support for syntax guidance and model output visualization.
Phrase: Seeking AI assistance for modeling tasks.

2.
Concepts: appreciating clear explanations, appreciate parameter clarification support
Relationship: The two concepts are related in that they both involve users valuing clarity and transparency in their interactions with the interface, whether it's explanations or parameter clarification.
Criteria: Users appreciate clear explanations and AI-provided clarification on parameters.
Phrase: Valuing transparent interface interactions.

3.
Concepts: identifying ai limitations
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Users recognize and acknowledge the limitations of LLM-driven interfaces and AI input capabilities.
Phrase: Acknowledging AI limitations.

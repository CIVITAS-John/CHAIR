1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Haha
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: After the official release of the new version, there will be more people here.
5. Designer: I guess it's because the teacher finds it annoying when people talk too much.233
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image]
8. P5: 233 By the way, let's see if there are any good designs to learn from.
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: Like a microcomputer.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1.
Concepts: assign tasks to ai, write code with guidance
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve the interaction between interviewees and the AI, where tasks are initiated, and coding is supported through guidance.
Criteria: Interviewees assign and initiate coding tasks by providing specific inputs to AI while simultaneously writing code with its guidance.
Phrase: Assign tasks and write code with AI guidance.

2.
Concepts: test ai functionality, seek clarification on ai capabilities
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as testing AI functionality often leads to inquiries about its capabilities, both of which aim to understand the AI's effectiveness.
Criteria: Interviewees evaluate the AI's search functionality through specific queries and inquire about its capabilities in relation to their tasks.
Phrase: Test AI functionality and clarify its capabilities.

3.
Concepts: human-ai: difference, compare ai to human capabilities
Relationship: The concepts relate to a comparative analysis where interviewees assess the differences between AI and human capabilities, highlighting strengths and limitations.
Criteria: Interviewees compare the AI's functionality to existing resources and human interns, noting discrepancies and acknowledging processing limitations.
Phrase: Compare AI and human capabilities.

4.
Concepts: acknowledge automation benefits, express satisfaction with ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are linked as acknowledging the benefits of automation often leads to satisfaction with the outputs generated by the AI.
Criteria: Interviewees recognize the positive aspects of AI's automatic code generation and express satisfaction with its functionality.
Phrase: Acknowledge benefits and express satisfaction with AI code.

5.
Concepts: question ai's accuracy, express frustration with ai reliability
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as questioning accuracy arises from experiences of frustration regarding the reliability of AI outputs.
Criteria: Users suspect that AI may produce incorrect outputs, leading to confusion, and interviewees express frustration with its reliability.
Phrase: Question AI accuracy and express frustration with reliability.

6.
Concepts: novice support, notes benefit for novices
Relationship: The concepts are directly related, as features that support novices are recognized for their beneficial impact on beginners' understanding and debugging of code.

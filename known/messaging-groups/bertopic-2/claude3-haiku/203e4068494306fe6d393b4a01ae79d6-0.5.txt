Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: designer 1 sets hardware expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

2.
Label: suggest improvement
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

3.
Label: engaged with community
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

19.
Label: explained feature specifics
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

20.
Label: user 4234 shows approval
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

21.
Label: communicated availability
Quotes:
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group

22.
Label: detailed educational needs
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

23.
Label: greet the community
Quotes:
- User: Hello everyone

24.
Label: mention feedback based prompts
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

25.
Label: responded to user context
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

26.
Label: engaged in future planning
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

Label: provided update expectation
Quotes:
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

29.
Label: accpeting the suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

30.
Label: explain intention of the app design
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

31.
Label: seeking context
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?
- Designer: Does the class have internet?
- User: PC version?

32.
Label: express anticipation

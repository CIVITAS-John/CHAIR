You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary tags: image quality; censorship
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary tags: platform query; user role identification
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary tags: avatar upload; teacher user role
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary tags: user role confirmation
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: This conversation seems to revolve around the development and feature requests for a physics simulation software called "Physics Lab". The designers are interacting with users, likely teachers, to gather feedback and prioritize upcoming features. To analyze this from multiple angles, we could consider the learning sciences perspective on how interactive simulations can support physics education, the HCI perspective on designing effective user interfaces and gathering user feedback, and the participatory design perspective on involving stakeholders like teachers in the design process.

Summary: The conversation starts with a designer sharing an image and another designer asking about uploading a higher quality avatar image. A user asks if it's for the PC version, identifying themselves as a teacher. The designer welcomes everyone and points to the group announcement for development plans and download links. Another teacher user requests specific physics simulation features like wave mechanics and optics experiments. The designer responds that they will prioritize completing the electrical and magnetism sections first before moving to mechanics, and will gather more user opinions then. The teachers express understanding and gratitude for the designers' work. Another user asks where to download the PC/interactive whiteboard version and finds it in the group files.

Notes: This conversation provides insights into the early development stages of an educational physics simulation software. The designers seem to be actively involving teachers as users to gather feedback and prioritize features. There is an emphasis on creating interactive, visual simulations to teach various physics concepts. The designers are taking a systematic approach by focusing on certain domains like electricity and magnetism first before expanding to other areas like mechanics based on user input. Overall, it highlights the importance of user-centered and participatory design processes when developing educational technology.

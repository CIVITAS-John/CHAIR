Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P14: How do you say?
2. P14: [Image 299]
3. P17: Brainiac.
4. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
5. P18: Just downloaded it.
6. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10
7. P6: When will it be updated?
8. P20: Why does that fuse keep burning out?

* Summary
This conversation seems to be about a software or app called "Brainiac". P14 shares an image (299) about it. P17 confirms the name "Brainiac". P18 asks how to use it after just downloading it. P19 shares a link, possibly related to instructions on using Brainiac. P6 asks when Brainiac will be updated. P20 asks an unrelated question about a fuse burning out.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can look for evidence of:

1. Learning processes (e.g. knowledge sharing, questioning, explanations)
2. User experience and usability issues with the software
3. Community participation and collaboration in understanding/using the software

We can code the data into categories related to these themes, looking at how the online community emerges through discussing, troubleshooting, and learning about this "Brainiac" software together.

# Learning Processes 
## Asking for Explanations
Definition: Instances where participants explicitly ask for explanations or instructions on how to use/understand something.
- P18: "By the way, how do you use it?"
- P18: "Just downloaded it."

## Providing Explanatory Resources
Definition: When participants share resources like links, images or files that could help explain or provide instructions.
- P19: "http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10"
- P14: "[Image 299]" 

## Unrelated Questions
Definition: Questions not directly related to the main topic of discussion
- P20: "Why does that fuse keep burning out?"

# User Experience
## Update Inquiries 
Definition: Questions about updates or upcoming changes to the software

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (13 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
13. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: requesting assistance; seeking feedback on avatar upload; expressing frustration with current avatar
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about platform compatibility
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: responding to user inquiry; offering to upload high definition avatar; initiating conversation with user
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: disclosing profession; identifying as a teacher
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: In this round of coding, I will focus on describing the events, contexts, and intents of the conversation. I will pay attention to how the designers and users interact, share information, and negotiate the development of Physics Lab. I will also consider the role of the online community in shaping the development process. Guiding questions include: How do designers and users communicate and collaborate? What are the designers' priorities and how do they respond to user requests? How do users contribute to the development process?

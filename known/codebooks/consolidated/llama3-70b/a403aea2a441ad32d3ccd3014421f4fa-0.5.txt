You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1. designer's role.
- Instances where the Designer is mentioned or addressed, highlighting their role in the community.
- Instances where the Designer (a moderator or administrator) interacts with community members, provides guidance, or shares their perspective.

2. uncertainty/hesitation.
- Expressions of uncertainty, hesitation, or confusion.
- Expressions of uncertainty, hesitation, or confusion from a member.

3. social support.
- Expressions of agreement, confirmation, or acknowledgement from one member to another.
- Instances of users showing appreciation, agreement, or encouragement towards others.

4. anticipation of growth.
- Expressions of expectation or prediction about the growth and expansion of the online community.
- Statements expressing anticipation or expectation of the group's growth or increased participation.

5. curiosity and exploration.
- Expressions of interest, questions, or a desire to learn and explore.
- Discussions and exchanges that show a sense of curiosity, interest, and a desire to explore the physics concepts and experiment further.

6. off-topic discussions.
- Instances where users engage in discussions unrelated to the physics topic, such as sharing irrelevant information.
- This code refers to instances where users engage in discussions that are not directly related to the main topic or purpose of the community.

7. community dynamics.
- Factors that influence the social dynamics and relationships within the online community.
- Factors related to the social interactions, relationships, and group dynamics within the community.
- Factors related to the interactions, relationships, and dynamics within the online community.
- Interactions that suggest the development of relationships, norms, or a sense of community among the members.

8. community participation.
- This code captures instances where users demonstrate active participation in the online community, such as expressing agreement, asking questions, or providing explanations.
- This code refers to instances where users actively engage with the community by expressing their opinions, asking questions, or responding to others.

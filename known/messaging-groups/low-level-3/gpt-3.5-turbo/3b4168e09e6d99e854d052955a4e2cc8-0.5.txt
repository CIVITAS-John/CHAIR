You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
9. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P14: Except me.
Preliminary tags: self deprecation; group membership; user engagement
2. P13: ＋1
Preliminary tags: agreement; alignment with previous comment; social interaction
3. P15: Plus one
Preliminary tags: social interaction; agreement; community engagement
4. P16: ＋1
Preliminary tags: social interaction; agreement; community participation
5. P10: What does "+1" mean?
Preliminary tags: language understanding; communication clarification; user inquiry
6. P11: It means "me too".
Preliminary tags: language understanding; communication explanation; user engagement
7. P13: +1 means the same opinion
8. P13: emmmm
9. P13: You can search on Baidu

Thoughts: When analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles such as learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, consider how users engage with each other, the social dynamics within the community, language understanding and clarification, user engagement, and the role of the designer in facilitating interactions and information sharing.

Tags for each message:
1. self deprecation; group membership; user engagement
2. agreement; alignment with previous comment; social interaction
3. social interaction; agreement; community engagement
4. social interaction; agreement; community participation
5. language understanding; communication clarification; user inquiry
6. language understanding; communication explanation; user engagement
7. social interaction; agreement; community engagement
8. hesitation; uncertainty; information sharing
9. information sharing; external resource suggestion; user support

Summary: The conversation revolves around users expressing agreement with each other using the "+1" shorthand, with some seeking clarification on its meaning and others providing explanations. There is an element of social interaction, community engagement, and user engagement evident in the dialogue. Additionally, the users demonstrate a willingness to support each other by sharing external resources. The designer's role in facilitating these interactions and ensuring clear communication is implied throughout the conversation.

Notes: The users in the Physics Lab community seem to have established a culture of mutual support and engagement, as seen in their interactions around understanding and explaining concepts like "+1." The designer could further enhance community engagement by providing clear explanations within the platform itself, reducing the need for users to seek external resources like Baidu.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: interpreting and evaluating ai responses, reasoning through ai responses
- Participants interpret and reason through ChatGPT's responses, evaluating their intuitive nature.
- Participants analyze or evaluate the responses of LLM-driven interfaces, and evaluate AI responses and decide on next steps based on human judgment.

2.
Concepts: help-seeking, seeking ai help
- Describes situations where users seek help or guidance from others or AI systems.
- Participants seek AI help with troubleshooting and interact with AI-driven interfaces to understand tasks, and seek help or assistance from AI in their work or learning process.

3.
Concepts: experiences failure, noting code limitations
- The participant identifies errors or limitations in the code generated by LLM-driven interfaces.
- Participants note incomplete or outdated AI-generated code and lack of external verification.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: interpreting and evaluating ai responses, reasoning through ai responses
Relationship: The concepts are interrelated, as interpreting AI responses involves evaluating their intuitive nature, which in turn requires reasoning through the responses.
Criteria: Participants analyze and evaluate AI responses to decide on next steps based on human judgment.
Phrase: Evaluating AI responses through reasoning

2.
Concepts: help-seeking, seeking ai help
Relationship: The concepts are synonymous, as seeking help implies seeking assistance or guidance from AI systems.
Criteria: Participants seek guidance or assistance from AI systems to understand tasks or troubleshoot issues.
Phrase: Seeking AI assistance

3.
Concepts: experiences failure, noting code limitations
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as experiencing failure often involves noting the limitations of the code generated by LLM-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants identify errors or limitations in AI-generated code, including incompleteness or outdated information.
Phrase: Identifying code limitations

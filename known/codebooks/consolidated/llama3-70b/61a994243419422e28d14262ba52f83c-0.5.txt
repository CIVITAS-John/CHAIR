You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
3. {Repeat the input 3}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 3}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 3}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 3}

Definitions for each code:

1. teacher demographics, teacher characteristics
Relationship: The two concepts are parallel, referring to different aspects of a teacher's profile.
Criteria: References to a teacher's personal or professional background, experience, or characteristics.
Label: Teacher Profile

2. development plan
Relationship: The two concepts are inclusive, with "plans or strategies" being a broader concept that encompasses "schedules or plans".
Criteria: Mentions of plans, strategies, or schedules for development, implementation, or feature releases.
Label: Development Strategy

3. platform development
Relationship: The two concepts are inclusive, with "development, updates, or maintenance" being a broader concept that encompasses "changes or additions".
Criteria: References to the creation, improvement, or maintenance of digital platforms, software, or tools.
Label: Platform Evolution

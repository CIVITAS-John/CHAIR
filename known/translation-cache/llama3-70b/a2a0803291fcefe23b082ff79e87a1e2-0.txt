1. 因为试管坏了
---
2. 怎么说？
---
3. 试管比较好，受热快，用料省。但是这个也没问题，土豪一点拿个鱼缸上面盖起来接个管子也可以嘛😂
---
4. 冷凝的液体不会倒流的么
---
5. 因为体积大，回流时候的液体已经被加热，不容易破裂
---
6. 噢噢噢
---
7. chemist应该没太考虑器具
---
8. 不过化学事情太多，估计下半年之前不可能去碰..
---
9. 事实上也不必要和书本中完全相同，虽然考试的时候...
---
10. 目前还没有什么比较真实的化学软件吧
---
11. 记得有个专业软件还好
---
12. 但有机神仙都解决不了
---
13. 所以要做主要还是从考试角度考虑了
---
14. 非标准的操作支持，但会标记出来（电学下一段就会有，比如带电操作）
---
15. 好
---
16. 超导体呢
---
17. 我猜想化学实验变量太多，所以模拟起来需要更大的运算量...
---
18. 你如果有能力搞个不付费又很全的应该很受欢迎淫
---
19. CPU不好就玩完了
---
20. 加你说的这些进去，就不是“Physics Lab”了😂
---
21. 实验课系列嘛
---
22. 诶好主意
---
23. 呵呵
---
24. ...难道你不知道说呵呵是很欠揍的吗
---
25. @3 光感元件能加吗
---
26. 问题是
---
27. 光从哪里来
---
28. 光呢
---
29. 你用小灯泡照光敏电阻吗
---
30. 手点
---
31. 我觉得没毛病
---
32. 那不就是一个滑变，除了曲线不一样（……）
===
Here are the translations:

---
1. Because the test tube is broken.
---

---
2. How do you say?
---

---
3. The test tube is better, it heats up quickly, and it saves materials. But this one is not a problem, a rich person can just put a fish tank on top and cover it with a pipe, haha.
---

---
4. Won't the condensed liquid flow back?
---

---
5. Because of its large volume, the liquid has already been heated during reflux, so it's not easy to break.
---

---
6. Oh oh oh.
---

---
7. The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment.
---

---
8. However, there are too many chemical reactions, and it's estimated that it won't be possible to deal with them before the second half of the year.
---

---
9. In fact, it's not necessary to be exactly the same as the textbook, although it's like that during exams...
---

---
10. Currently, there isn't any very realistic chemistry software, right?
---

---
11. I remember there's a professional software that's pretty good.
---

---
12. But even the organic gods can't solve it.
---

---
13. So the main thing is to consider it from the exam perspective.
---

---
14. Non-standard operations are supported, but they will be marked (e.g., electrochemical operations will be marked in the next section).
---

---
15. Good.
---

---
16. What about superconductors?
---

---
17. I think the variables in chemical experiments are too many, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
---

---
18. If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
---

---
19. If the CPU is not good, it's over.
---

---
20. If you add all these to it, it's not a "Physics Lab" anymore, haha.
---

---
21. It's an experimental course series, right?
---

---
22. Ah, good idea.
---

---
23. Hehe.
---

---
24. ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is very annoying?
---

---
25. @3 Can photodiodes be added?
---

---
26. The question is...
---

---
27. Where does the light come from?
---

---
28. The light...
---

---
29. Do you use a small light bulb to shine on a photodiode?
---

---
30. Hand point.
---

---
31. I think it's not a problem.
---

---
32. Isn't that just a sliding variable, except the curve is different (...)?

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: seeking guidance
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- User: How do you use the PC version?
- User: Is there a user manual?
- User: How to download?

2.
Label: personal connection
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

3.

4.
Label: user experience feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

5.
Label: setting boundaries
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

6.
Label: planning for future development
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

7.
Label: promise that the update is ongoing

- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

13.
Label: highlighting interactive features

Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

22.
Label: single slits
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

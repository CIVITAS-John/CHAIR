You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Thoughts: These messages seem to be about establishing norms and shared language within the community. There is some confusion around the meaning of "+1" which gets clarified through explanations from others. I should look for tags related to community building, shared understandings, clarifying meanings, and negotiating norms.

Tags for each message:
1. self-deprecation; humor; rapport-building
2. agreement; affirmation; norm-establishment  
3. agreement; affirmation; norm-establishment
4. agreement; affirmation; norm-establishment
5. seeking-clarification; community-norms; language-use
6. explanation; community-norms; language-use
7. explanation; community-norms; language-use
8. uncertainty; hedging
9. advice; external-reference; knowledge-sharing

Summary: The conversation starts with some humorous self-deprecation from P14, which is affirmed by several others using "+1" to indicate agreement. P10 asks for clarification on what "+1" means, showing a lack of shared understanding of this community norm. P11 and P13 provide explanations that it means "me too" or indicating the same opinion. P13 seems briefly uncertain in their explanation, then advises P10 to search online for more information, suggesting use of external resources.

Notes: This exchange highlights the process of negotiating shared language and norms within an online community. The use of "+1" seems to be an emerging convention that not all members are initially familiar with. Through questioning, explanations, and referencing external knowledge sources, the group works towards establishing a common understanding. This negotiation of meaning and norms appears to be an important part of how the Physics Lab community develops its culture and practices. The mixture of humor, agreement, clarification and advice suggests an environment conducive to cooperative learning.

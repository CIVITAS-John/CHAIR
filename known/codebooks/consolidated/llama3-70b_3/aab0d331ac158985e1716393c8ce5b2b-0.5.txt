You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

6.
Label: user 4232 highlights practical application
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

7.

Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

8.
Label: highlight interdisciplinary connections

Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

11.
Label: designer 1 provides development update
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

15.
Label: plan for iterative feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

16.
Label: affirm the value of quality craftsmanship

19.
Label: designer 1 shares timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

20.
Label: emphasize commitment to quality
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

21.
Label: engaged in dialogue
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

22.
Label: enhance engagement through visual feedback
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

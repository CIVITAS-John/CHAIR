You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary tags: designer 1; software feature; simulated experiment assessment; experimental details; zero adjustment; user friendly design
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary tags: user 4232; positive feedback; simulated experiment assessment
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary tags: designer 1; participatory design; user consultation; group involvement
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Preliminary tags: designer 1; circuit diagrams; textbooks; user consultation; intersection types
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary tags: designer 1; circuit diagrams; user consultation; intersection types; visual representation
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary tags: user 4234; agreement; circuit diagrams; old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation begins with the designer discussing a new feature for simulated experiment assessment, seeking input on specific details like zero adjustment. They then consult the community about the type of intersection used in circuit diagrams in current textbooks, sharing visual representations and incorporating user feedback. The designer also mentions that they are working on simplifying the circuit diagram feature and that an update is coming soon, with a release schedule for different platforms.

Notes: The designer's approach to development, which involves continuous consultation with the community and a focus on user-friendly design, is likely to contribute to the emergence of the Physics Lab online community. The community members seem engaged and willing to provide feedback, which is a positive sign for the development of the software and the community. The designer's commitment to releasing updates and their transparency about the development process also appear to be fostering a sense of community and engagement.

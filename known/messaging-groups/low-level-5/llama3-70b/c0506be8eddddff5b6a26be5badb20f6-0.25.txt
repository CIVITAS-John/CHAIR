You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (18 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
18. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: Thank you.
Preliminary phrases: expressing gratitude; showing appreciation; acknowledging support
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary phrases: encouraging openness; promoting transparency; fostering a sense of safety; inviting feedback
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary phrases: providing feedback; sharing opinions; expressing enthusiasm; highlighting usability
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary phrases: considering alternatives; exploring solutions; addressing limitations; thinking aloud
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary phrases: explaining technicalities; providing context; setting expectations; managing limitations
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary phrases: announcing updates; sharing news; providing information; building anticipation; fostering engagement
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

Thoughts: 
In this first round of coding, I aim to capture the essence of the conversation between users and designers in the Physics Lab online community. I will focus on the language used, the tone, and the intentions behind each message. I will explore how the designers respond to user feedback, how they communicate technical information, and how users express their needs and opinions. I will also consider the context of the conversation, including the development process and the users' experiences with the software.

Interpretation phrases for each item:

1. expressing gratitude; showing appreciation; acknowledging support
2. encouraging openness; promoting transparency; fostering a sense of safety; inviting feedback
3. providing feedback; sharing opinions; expressing enthusiasm; highlighting usability
4. considering alternatives; exploring solutions; addressing limitations; thinking aloud
5. explaining technicalities; providing context; setting expectations; managing limitations
6. announcing updates; sharing news; providing information; building anticipation; fostering engagement
7. listing features; describing updates; showcasing improvements; highlighting bug fixes
8. suggesting improvements; expressing needs; highlighting regional differences; advocating for accessibility
9. acknowledging feedback; promising updates; setting expectations; demonstrating responsiveness
10. expanding on suggestions; considering broader implications; thinking about user experience
11. explaining technical details; clarifying functionality; providing context
12. acknowledging limitations; describing workarounds; thinking aloud
13. sharing personal experiences; providing anecdotes; illustrating technical points
14. expressing agreement; showing understanding; acknowledging designer's perspective
15. suggesting features; expressing needs; highlighting convenience; advocating for flexibility
16. promising features; setting expectations; demonstrating responsiveness
17. inquiring about context; seeking clarification; understanding user needs
18. explaining constraints; describing institutional limitations; highlighting challenges

Summary:
The conversation revolves around the development and use of Physics Lab software. Users provide feedback, suggest improvements, and express enthusiasm, while designers respond with explanations, updates, and promises. The tone is collaborative, with a focus on improving the user experience and addressing technical limitations. The conversation highlights the importance of usability, accessibility, and flexibility in the software design.

Notes:
It appears that the designers are open to feedback and willing to make changes to improve the software. The users are actively engaged in the development process, providing valuable insights and suggestions. The conversation also reveals some institutional constraints, such as limited internet access in classrooms, which may impact the design and functionality of the software.

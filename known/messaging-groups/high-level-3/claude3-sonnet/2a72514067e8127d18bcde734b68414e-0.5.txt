You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

* Summary
The conversation revolves around requests and plans for adding new features and experiments to the Physics Lab software. A user requests dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves, vibrations, and optical experiments. A designer responds that they will prioritize completing the electrical and magnetism sections first before considering mechanics. The designer also mentions gathering more opinions before starting on mechanics. Another user asks about downloading a PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab. The designer shares an image and mentions an upcoming update that will make dry batteries non-ideal components, with the student power supply being an ideal component for both DC and AC.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Learning sciences: Identify factors that facilitate or hinder effective learning experiences through the Physics Lab software, such as the requested demonstrations, experiments, and simulations.
2. Human-computer interaction: Examine the user interface and interaction design elements, such as the accessibility of downloading the software, the clarity of component representations, and the responsiveness to user requests.
3. Participatory design: Explore how the designers involve users in the design process, gather feedback, and prioritize feature requests, as well as the dynamics of the user-designer collaboration.

# User involvement in design process
## Soliciting user requests
Definition: Instances where designers actively seek input, requests, or feedback from users to inform the design process.
- "First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request."
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~"

## Prioritizing user requests
Definition: Decisions made by designers regarding which user requests to prioritize or address first.
- "We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts."

## Responding to user requests
Definition: Instances where designers directly respond to or acknowledge user requests or feedback.
- "Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work."
- "Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts."

# Learning experiences
## Requested learning content
Definition: Specific learning content, demonstrations, or experiments requested by users to be included in the software.
- "Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference?"
- "Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments."

## Simulation fidelity
Definition: Aspects related to the accuracy, realism, or fidelity of simulations and models within the software.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

4.
Concepts: notes limitations of ai input, identifies limitations and constraints of current ai implementations
- Participants identify limitations of AI input, such as character limits for code processing.
- Participants mention constraints or limitations while using AI-generated code.

5.
Concepts: interpreting ai's responses, reasons through ai response
- Participants observe and interpret AI's responses to understand its understanding of user requests.
- Analyzing or interpreting AI-generated responses or code, and evaluating their usefulness or correctness.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: interact with ai-generated code, collaborate with ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve participants working with AI-generated code, either by summarizing and interacting with it or using it as a reference for writing their own code.
Criteria: Participants engage with AI-generated code in various ways to support their work.
Phrase: Collaborate with AI-generated code.

2.
Concepts: finds ai assistance helpful, finding explanations clear and interfaces intuitive
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the perceived ease of use and usefulness of AI-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants perceive AI-driven interfaces as helpful and easy to use.
Phrase: Value AI-driven interfaces.

3.
Concepts: questioning ai capabilities, identifying netlogo limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve participants reflecting on the capabilities and limitations of AI in NetLogo.
Criteria: Participants critically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of AI in NetLogo.
Phrase: Evaluate AI capabilities.

4.
Concepts: notes limitations of ai input, identifies limitations and constraints of current ai implementations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve participants recognizing the limitations of AI implementations.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge limitations and constraints of current AI implementations.
Phrase: Identify AI limitations.

5.
Concepts: interpreting ai's responses, reasons through ai response
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve participants trying to understand AI's responses and evaluating their usefulness.
Criteria: Participants interpret and evaluate AI-generated responses or code.
Phrase: Interpret AI responses.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: fostering collaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group

18.
Label: prioritizing local export
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

19.
Label: expanding development scope
Quotes:

20.
Label: supporting advanced feature plans
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

21.
Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

22.
Label: comparing to other tools
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

23.
Label: there's a mix of formal and informal communication styles
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

24.
Label: express interest in platform development
Quotes:
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

25.
Label: demonstrating self reliance
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

26.
Label: demonstrating reflective thinking
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

27.
Label: planning
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

28.
Label: sharing update schedule
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

29.
Label: design principles
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

30.
Label: promoting problem solving in the application
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

31.
Label: delaying decisions
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (13 in total):
1. {an interpretation of message 1}

13. {an interpretation of message 13}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary codes: designer 1 requests help with uploading a high definition avatar; revealing technical difficulties and a desire for self presentation
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary codes: user 4229 inquires about a pc version; indicating interest in the platform's compatibility
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary codes: designer 1 responds to user 4229; uploading a new avatar and asking about their profession; demonstrating a willingness to engage and understand the user's context
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary codes: user 4229 self identifies as a teacher; providing context for their interest in the platform
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: For this first round of coding, I will focus on identifying the initial interactions, requests, and responses within the online community. I will consider the roles of designers and users, their intentions, and the context of the conversation. I will examine the language used, the tone, and the content of the messages to understand the emerging dynamics of the community. Guiding questions: What are the designers' and users' goals and expectations? How do they communicate and respond to each other?

Codes for each message:

1. Image sharing; introductory gesture by Designer-2
2. Designer 1 requests help with uploading a high-definition avatar; revealing technical difficulties and a desire for self-presentation
3. User 4229 inquires about a PC version; indicating interest in the platform's compatibility
4. Designer 1 responds to User 4229; uploading a new avatar and asking about their profession; demonstrating a willingness to engage and understand the user's context
5. User 4229 self-identifies as a teacher; providing context for their interest in the platform
6. Designer 1 shares information about the development plan and PC download address; taking a proactive role in community engagement
7. Designer 1 solicits feedback and suggestions; encouraging user participation
8. User 4230 makes a specific request for simulation features; demonstrating a high level of engagement and interest in the platform's educational value
9. Designer 1 sets priorities for development; managing user expectations
10. Designer 1 expresses the need for gathering opinions; acknowledging the importance of user feedback
11. User 4230 expresses gratitude; acknowledging the designer's effort
12. User 4231 inquires about the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab; seeking access to the platform
13. User 4231 finds the group files; resolving their initial inquiry

Summary: The conversation begins with Designer-2 sharing an image, followed by Designer-1's request for help with uploading a high-definition avatar. The discussion shifts to users inquiring about the PC version and making specific requests for features, such as simulations and optical experiments. Designer-1 responds by sharing information, soliciting feedback, and setting priorities for development. Users express gratitude and acknowledge the designer's effort.

Notes: The conversation reveals a sense of community and collaboration, with designers and users engaging in a dialogue about the platform's development and features. The designers are proactive in sharing information and soliciting feedback, while users are enthusiastic about the platform's potential and provide specific suggestions. The conversation highlights the importance of user feedback and participation in shaping the development of Physics Lab.

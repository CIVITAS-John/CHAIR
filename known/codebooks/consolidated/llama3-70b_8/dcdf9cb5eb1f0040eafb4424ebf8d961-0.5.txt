You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (32 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

Label: reiterating feature explanation
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

2.
Label: demonstrating proactive engagement
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

3.
Label: technical limitations are communicated directly
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

4.
Label: decision-making
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

5.
Label: encouraging further development
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

6.

- Designer: There will be.

7.
Label: suggest educational enhancements
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

8.
Label: indicating responsiveness to user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

9.
Label: highlight practicality
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

10.
Label: active engagement between designers and users
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

11.
Label: list upcoming features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

12.
Label: apologize for timing
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

13.
Label: offering design suggestions
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

14.
Label: expressing agreement with the designer's statement
Quotes:
- User: Indeed

15.
Label: valuing design quality
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

16.
Label: acknowledges finding the pc version in group files
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

17.
Label: setting expectations for mechanics
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

18.
Label: solicit suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

19.
Label: respond to initial question
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

20.
Label: states that physics lab does not support the xp system
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

21.
Label: illustrate classroom success
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

22.
Label: describes student reaction
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

23.
Label: raise a concern for the new feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

24.
Label: expressing challenges faced in the classroom
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

25.
Label: explain complexity
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

26.
Label: engaging with designer
Quotes:
- User: PC version?
- User: Yes.

27.
Label: acknowledging the need for manual editing and the timeline for implementation
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

28.
Label: teacher-admin interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

29.
Label: detailing plans for advanced features
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

30.
Label: offering insight into prevailing practices
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

31.
Label: sharing version information
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

32.
Label: highlighting security concerns in educational settings

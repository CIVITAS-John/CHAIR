Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation revolves around discussions related to chemistry experiments, equipment, software simulations, and exam strategies. Participants share their experiences, ask questions, provide explanations, and offer advice. The discussion also touches on topics like MOSFETs and superconductors, indicating a broader interest in physics and related fields.
1. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
2. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
3. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
4. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
5. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
6. P11: Hey, good idea.
7. P2: Hehe.
8. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
9. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
10. Designer: The question is,
11. Designer: Where does the light come from?
12. P11: What about light?
13. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
14. P2: Touch it with your hand.
15. P14: I think there's no problem.
16. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
17. P2: And a small light.
18. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
19. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
20. P2: ï¼Ÿ
21. P14: [Image]
22. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
23. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
24. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
25. P1: Let's put up some ads.
26. Designer: Hmm.
27. P14: 
28. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
29. Designer: Oh.
30. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).

Summary: The conversation revolves around ideas for developing a physics simulation software or lab environment. Participants discuss computational requirements, light-sensitive components, user interactions, and monetization strategies like ads or fees. There is a mix of ideation, suggestions, agreements/disagreements, clarification questions, explanations, and analogies.

Notes: The conversation highlights the collaborative process of ideation, where participants contribute ideas, provide feedback, clarify doubts, and evaluate feasibility. There is a focus on exploring various features and components, as well as considering monetization approaches. The discussion also touches on abandoning certain ideas (like pressure-sensitive resistors) based on further analysis. Overall, it reflects the iterative nature of brainstorming and refining concepts within a group setting.

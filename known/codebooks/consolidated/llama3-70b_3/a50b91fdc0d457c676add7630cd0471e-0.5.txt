You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: analyze code quickly with ai, evaluating ai-generated code quality and summarizing output
- Participants analyze code quickly with AI and compare AI to human code review.
- Participants evaluate and test AI-generated code for its quality and capabilities, and summarize AI-generated code and summarize and evaluate generated code.

2.
Concepts: identifies gaps in ai outputs, sees ai error detection potential
- The participant identifies gaps in AI outputs, recognizing limitations in AI assistance and support.
- Participants see AI as an outside observer that can point out errors and acknowledge AI limitations in efficiency.

3.
Concepts: preferring immediate feedback, seeks instant feedback due to time constraints
- Participants value and expect rapid feedback from AI-driven interfaces.
- Seeks human assistance but relies on instant feedback due to time constraints

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: analyze code quickly with ai, evaluating ai-generated code quality and summarizing output
Relationship: The concepts are related as participants use AI to analyze code quickly, evaluate the quality of the generated code, and summarize the output, indicating a workflow of AI-assisted code review.
Criteria: Participants analyze code quickly with AI, evaluate AI-generated code quality, and summarize output.
Phrase: Evaluating AI-generated code quality.

2.
Concepts: identifies gaps in ai outputs, sees ai error detection potential
Relationship: The concepts are related as participants recognize the limitations of AI outputs and see the potential of AI in detecting errors, indicating an awareness of AI's capabilities and limitations.
Criteria: Participants identify gaps in AI outputs and recognize AI's error detection potential.
Phrase: Recognizing AI limitations.

3.
Concepts: preferring immediate feedback, seeks instant feedback due to time constraints
Relationship: The concepts are related as participants prefer immediate feedback due to time constraints, indicating a need for rapid feedback in their work.
Criteria: Participants prefer immediate feedback due to time constraints.
Phrase: Seeking instant feedback.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

1. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
2. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
3. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits, so I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know, so please enlighten me in the future. Thank you.
4. P4: Has it been updated?
5. P11: It's not ideal...
6. P11: I will consider the impedance.
7. P11: Updated to the latest version.
8. P11: Thank you.
9. P12: My sister just found a group, the group owner is crazy, keeps sending red packets, hurry up and grab them at 695176754.
10. P5: ã€‚
11. P5: @Designer

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab's online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with the Designer pointing out an issue with a diode, followed by questions and responses from other participants (P10, P11, and P5). The conversation is interrupted by an off-topic message from P12, but eventually returns to the topic at hand.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do participants negotiate meaning and understanding in an online community? How do designers and participants interact and influence each other? What role do social and technical factors play in shaping the online community?

# Social Dynamics
## Politeness
Definition: Expressions of gratitude, apology, or respect towards others in the conversation.
- "I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet." (P10)
- "Thank you." (P11)
- "Please enlighten me in the future. Thank you." (P10)

## Off-topic Messages
Definition: Messages that are unrelated to the main topic of discussion.
- "My sister just found a group, the group owner is crazy, keeps sending red packets, hurry up and grab them at 695176754." (P12)

# Technical Discussion
## Technical Questions
Definition: Questions or statements that relate to technical aspects of the topic.
- "Is there a forward voltage drop?" (Designer)
- "I will consider the impedance." (P11)

## Technical Feedback
Definition: Responses or comments that provide technical feedback or suggestions.
- "It's not ideal..." (P11)
- "Updated to the latest version." (P11)

# Community Building
## Addressing Others
Definition: Messages that address or mention other participants in the conversation.
- "@Designer" (P5)
- "I'm sorry, senior..." (P10)

## Community Norms
Definition: Implicit or explicit references to norms or expectations within the community.
- "Please enlighten me in the future." (P10)

Note: This codebook is not exhaustive, and you may need to add or modify codes as you continue to analyze the conversation.

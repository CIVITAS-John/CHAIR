Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

* Summary
The conversation starts with a user (User-4230) making a request for the Physics Lab team to create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves, mechanical vibrations, and optical experiments. The designers (Designer-1) respond by sharing their development plans, prioritizing the completion of the electrical section first, followed by magnetism, and then other parts. They also mention gathering more opinions before starting the mechanics section. Another user (User-4231) inquires about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab and is directed to the group files. The designers also mention upcoming changes, such as the removal of dry batteries as ideal components and the introduction of a student power supply that supports both DC and AC.

* Plan
The analysis of this conversation will focus on three theoretical angles: learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

From the learning sciences perspective, we will examine how the designers plan to develop the content and features of Physics Lab to support student learning of various physics concepts, such as mechanical waves, vibrations, and optics. We will also look at how the designers plan to gather feedback and opinions from the community to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of the learning experiences.

The human-computer interaction lens will help us understand the design decisions made by the team, such as the choice of components and the development of the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab. We will also explore how the designers aim to improve the user experience and make the tool more accessible and engaging for the learners.

The participatory design approach will guide us in examining how the designers involve the community in the development process, seeking feedback and incorporating user needs and preferences into the design. This will help us understand the collaborative nature of the project and the ways in which the community shapes the emergence of the online Physics Lab community.

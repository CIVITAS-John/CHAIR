You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: critically evaluates ai feedback, tests and evaluates ai search results
- The participant assesses the quality and usefulness of LLM-driven interface outputs.
- The participant evaluates the accuracy of AI's search results.

2.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1.
Concepts: critically evaluates ai feedback, tests and evaluates ai search results
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve assessing the quality of AI-driven outputs, with the first concept focusing on feedback and the second on search results.
Criteria: Participants critically evaluate the quality and usefulness of LLM-driven interface outputs by testing and assessing the accuracy of AI search results.
Phrase: Critically evaluates AI-driven outputs.

2.
Concepts: emphasizing human effort in debugging, emphasizes user expertise in debugging
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both highlight the importance of human involvement and expertise in the debugging process.
Criteria: Participants recognize the importance of user expertise in identifying and understanding errors, moving beyond just syntax errors to conceptual errors.
Phrase: Emphasizes human expertise in debugging.

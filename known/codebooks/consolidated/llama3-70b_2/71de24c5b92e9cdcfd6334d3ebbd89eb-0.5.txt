You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

4.
Label: reiterate need for user manual
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

5.
Label: designer 1 responds to user request
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

6.
Label: user 4234 acknowledges progress
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

8.
Label: acknowledging development time
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

9.
Label: acknowledges feature
Quotes:
- User: Oh, this is nice

10.
Label: sets expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: The update is quite large...

11.
Label: ask about user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

12.
Label: explaining use case scenario
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

13.
Label: plan timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

14.
Label: providing context for software use
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

15.
Label: user 4232 proposes solution
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

16.
Label: future update
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

17.
Label: mentions delay in mechanics experiments due to focus on electromagnetism
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

18.
Label: mentions group sharing feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

19.
Label: align design with educational standards
Quotes:

- User: Are there any other updates recently?

21.
Label: acknowledges social norms
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

22.
Label: share positive classroom experience
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

23.
Label: align with user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

24.
Label: inquiry
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

25.
Label: recommends optimizing auto generated layout
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

Thoughts: This conversation seems to be about the meaning of the "+1" expression used in the online community. The messages indicate that it is a way to express agreement or support for a previous statement. I will focus on identifying the low-level tags related to social interactions and community building.

Messages:
1. P16: Expressing agreement|Expressing support
2. P10: Asking for clarification
3. P11: Explaining the meaning of "+1"
4. P13: Confirming the meaning of "+1"
5. P13: Expressing uncertainty
6. P13: Suggesting external information source
7. P10: Acknowledging understanding
8. P2: Expressing agreement
9. P14: Introducing a new topic
10. P17: Expressing passive observation

Summary: The conversation starts with a simple "+1" expression, which leads to a discussion about its meaning within the online community. The participants explain that it is a way to show agreement or support for a previous statement. The conversation then shifts to a new topic about something in the beaker, and one participant indicates they are just observing.

Notes: This conversation demonstrates the emergence of a shared understanding and use of a specific expression ("-1") within the online community. It also shows how the community members interact to clarify and explain the meaning of this expression, as well as how the conversation can shift to new topics. The low-level tags suggest that the community is building a shared language and norms around expressing agreement and support.

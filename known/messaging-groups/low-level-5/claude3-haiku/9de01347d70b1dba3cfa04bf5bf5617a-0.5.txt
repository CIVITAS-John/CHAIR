You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: proposing specific physics simulation and demonstration features; making a request
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: outlining development priorities; focusing on electrical and magnetism topics first
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: planning to gather more opinions before starting mechanics; acknowledging the need to remember user feedback
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: expressing gratitude for the designers' efforts
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: asking for download information; acknowledging group files
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: confirming finding the download information
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

8. announcing the removal of dry batteries as ideal components; suggesting the use of internal resistance simulation
9. introducing the student power supply as an ideal component supporting both DC and AC

Summary: The conversation shows the emergence of an online community around the development of Physics Lab. Users are actively providing feedback and making requests for specific features, while the designers are outlining their development priorities and acknowledging the need to gather more user input. The designers are also introducing new component features, such as the removal of dry batteries and the addition of an ideal student power supply. This iterative process of user feedback and designer response suggests a participatory design approach, where the community is shaping the development of the tool.

Notes: The conversation highlights the importance of user engagement and feedback in the development of an educational technology tool like Physics Lab. The designers seem to be taking a thoughtful and responsive approach, planning to gather more opinions before moving forward with certain features. This suggests a commitment to understanding the needs and preferences of the user community. Additionally, the introduction of new component features, such as the student power supply, demonstrates the designers' attention to improving the simulation's realism and functionality. Overall, the conversation suggests a collaborative and iterative process of community-driven development.

~~~
1. 因为试管坏了
---
2. 怎么说？
---
3. 试管比较好，受热快，用料省。但是这个也没问题，土豪一点拿个鱼缸上面盖起来接个管子也可以嘛😂
---
4. 冷凝的液体不会倒流的么
---
5. 因为体积大，回流时候的液体已经被加热，不容易破裂
---
6. 噢噢噢
---
7. chemist应该没太考虑器具
---
8. 不过化学事情太多，估计下半年之前不可能去碰..
---
9. 事实上也不必要和书本中完全相同，虽然考试的时候...
---
10. 目前还没有什么比较真实的化学软件吧
---
11. 记得有个专业软件还好
---
12. 但有机神仙都解决不了
---
13. 所以要做主要还是从考试角度考虑了
---
14. 非标准的操作支持，但会标记出来（电学下一段就会有，比如带电操作）
---
15. 好
---
16. 超导体呢
---
17. 我猜想化学实验变量太多，所以模拟起来需要更大的运算量...
---
18. 你如果有能力搞个不付费又很全的应该很受欢迎淫
---
19. CPU不好就玩完了
---
20. 加你说的这些进去，就不是“Physics Lab”了😂
---
21. 实验课系列嘛
---
22. 诶好主意
---
23. 呵呵
---
24. ...难道你不知道说呵呵是很欠揍的吗
---
25. @3 光感元件能加吗
---
26. 问题是
---
27. 光从哪里来
---
28. 光呢
---
29. 你用小灯泡照光敏电阻吗
---
30. 手点
---
31. 我觉得没毛病
---
32. 那不就是一个滑变，除了曲线不一样（……）
---
33. 和小灯
---
34. 微付费吧。。。
---
35. 六块钱包月= =
---
36. 再说吧
---
37. 没钱点广告也可以
---
38. 良心游戏的做法吧
---
39. 上广告吧
---
40. 用手点一松就不导电
---
41. 喔
---
42. 压敏电阻算了（……）
---
43. 刚想说
---
44. 有时候并不是觉得收费太高 而是根本不知道怎么充
---
45. 还能适配一下3Dtouch
---
46. app store 直接充吧？
---
47. 觉得有点麻烦
---
48. app store 现在按个指纹就搞定了啊
---
49. 毕竟只是初中狗
---
50. 这倒是
---
51. 那就点广告吧hh
---
52. 可以的可以的
---
53. 初中整么了[Emoji]
---
54. 一个初中都比你厉害
---
55. 只是希望广告不要占过多的实验界面
---
56. 少年你理解错了
---
57. 他是说自己上初中没有好的支付方式
---
58. 广告不会常驻的
---
59. 就是让你们点广告换积分，用积分解锁新内容这样
---
60. @2 或许你可以顺着网线来打我
---
61. 我会编程的
---
62. 好的！
---
63. ios常驻广告banner太恶心了
---
64. 的确
===
---
1. Because the test tube is broken
---
2. How do you say it?
---
3. Test tubes are better, they heat up quickly and save materials. But this is also fine, if you're a bit extravagant, you can cover a fish tank and connect a tube 😂
---
4. Won't the condensed liquid flow back?
---
5. Because of the large volume, the liquid has already been heated during reflux, making it less likely to break
---
6. Oh oh oh
---
7. The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much
---
8. But there are too many chemistry things, probably won't be able to touch it before the second half of the year..
---
9. In fact, it's not necessary to be exactly the same as in the books, although during exams...
---
10. There isn't any relatively realistic chemistry software at the moment
---
11. I remember there was a professional software that was okay
---
12. But even the gods of organic chemistry can't solve it
---
13. So if you want to do it, you still have to consider it from the exam perspective
---
14. Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section on electricity will have it, such as charged operations)
---
15. Okay
---
16. What about superconductors?
---
17. I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a larger amount of computation...
---
18. If you have the ability to make a comprehensive and free one, it should be very popular
---
19. If the CPU is bad, it's game over
---
20. Adding what you said, it wouldn't be "Physics Lab" anymore 😂
---
21. It's a series of lab courses
---
22. Hey, good idea
---
23. Hehe
---
24. ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is very annoying?
---
25. @3 Can you add a light sensor?
---
26. The problem is
---
27. Where does the light come from
---
28. What about the light
---
29. Are you using a small bulb to illuminate the photoresistor?
---
30. Tap with your hand
---
31. I think there's no problem
---
32. Isn't that just a variable resistor, except the curve is different (……)
---
33. And a small light
---
34. Micro-payment maybe...
---
35. Six yuan per month = =
---
36. We'll see
---
37. If you don't have money, you can also click on ads
---
38. It's the approach of a conscientious game
---
39. Put up ads
---
40. If you tap and release, it won't conduct electricity
---
41. Oh
---
42. Forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (……)
---
43. Just about to say
---
44. Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but that you don't know how to pay
---
45. It can also be adapted to 3D touch
---
46. Just charge directly through the app store?
---
47. Feels a bit troublesome
---
48. Now you can do it with just a fingerprint on the app store
---
49. After all, just a middle school kid
---
50. That's true
---
51. Then just click on ads hh
---
52. That's doable
---
53. What's wrong with middle school [Emoji]
---
54. Even a middle schooler is better than you
---
55. Just hope the ads don't take up too much of the experiment interface
---
56. Young man, you misunderstood
---
57. He means he doesn't have a good payment method in middle school
---
58. Ads won't be permanent
---
59. Just let you click on ads to earn points, and use points to unlock new content
---
60. @2 Maybe you can follow the network cable to hit me
---
61. I can program
---
62. Okay!
---
63. Permanent ad banners on iOS are really disgusting
---
64. Indeed

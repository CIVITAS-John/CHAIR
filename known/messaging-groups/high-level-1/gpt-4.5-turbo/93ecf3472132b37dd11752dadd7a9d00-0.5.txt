Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the community's emergence.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
# Label of category 1

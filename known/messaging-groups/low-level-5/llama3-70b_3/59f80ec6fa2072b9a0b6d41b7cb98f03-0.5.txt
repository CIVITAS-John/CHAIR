You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (18 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
18. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: shares personal experience; provides anecdotal evidence; establishes common ground
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: expresses agreement; reinforces designer's statement; builds rapport
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: suggests new feature; identifies practical use case; promotes user driven development
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: confirms feature development; sets expectations for future releases; builds trust
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquires about classroom context; gathers requirements; demonstrates user centered design
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: shares institutional constraint; explains technical limitation; highlights potential challenge
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Thoughts: In this conversation, I'll focus on how the designers and users interact, share experiences, and negotiate features. I'll examine how the designers respond to user feedback, and how users provide context and suggestions. I'll also look for instances of user-centered design, participatory design, and how the designers build trust and rapport with the users.

Interpretation phrases for each item:

1. shares personal experience; provides anecdotal evidence; establishes common ground
2. expresses agreement; reinforces designer's statement; builds rapport
3. suggests new feature; identifies practical use case; promotes user driven development
4. confirms feature development; sets expectations for future releases; builds trust
5. inquires about classroom context; gathers requirements; demonstrates user centered design
6. shares institutional constraint; explains technical limitation; highlights potential challenge
7. expresses amusement; acknowledges unexpected event
8. recognizes need for local export; prioritizes feature development
9. explains common institutional practice; provides context for design
10. acknowledges user's statement; shows interest
11. shares positive experience; provides feedback on software effectiveness
12. asks about user's profession; seeks to understand user's context
13. shares professional background; establishes credibility
14. provides update on software development; sets expectations for release
15. apologizes for potential disturbance; shows consideration for users
16. requests information; seeks guidance on downloading
17. apologizes for interruption; shows politeness
18. suggests new feature; promotes collaborative functionality

Summary: This conversation is characterized by the designers' efforts to engage with users, gather feedback, and provide updates on the software development. The users share their experiences, provide context, and suggest new features. The conversation is marked by a sense of rapport-building, trust, and user-centered design.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the designers respond to user feedback and how they prioritize feature development based on user needs. The conversation also highlights the importance of understanding the classroom context and institutional constraints in designing educational software. I'll continue to explore these themes in the next round of coding.

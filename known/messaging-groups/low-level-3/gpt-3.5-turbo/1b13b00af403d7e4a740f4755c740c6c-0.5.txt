You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P5: I need logic gates for making a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
Preliminary tags: application of knowledge in project; preference for practical learning
2. P6: [Image 14]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
3. P6: [Image 15]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
4. P7: How to play?
Preliminary tags: seeking guidance on platform usage
5. Designer: Play by conducting experiments.233
Preliminary tags: guidance on platform usage; encouraging experimentation
6. P8: Why suddenly add a wave?
Preliminary tags: seeking clarification; community engagement
7. P7: Oh, I see.
8. P2: [Image 20]
9. P2: [Image 21]
10. P7: 66

Thoughts: It seems like the community is engaged in both practical projects and seeking guidance on using the platform. The Designer is actively participating by providing guidance and encouraging experimentation. There is also some confusion and seeking of clarification within the community. The use of images adds a visual element to the conversation, but the content of the images is not specified.

Tags for each message:
1. application of knowledge in project; preference for practical learning; logic gates
2. image sharing; visual content
3. image sharing; visual content
4. seeking guidance on platform usage; gameplay
5. guidance on platform usage; encouraging experimentation; community engagement
6. seeking clarification; community engagement; platform feature
7. community engagement
8. image sharing; visual content
9. image sharing; visual content
10. engagement metrics; community activity

Summary: The community is actively engaged in practical projects, seeking guidance, and interacting with the Designer. There is a mix of practical project discussions, platform usage inquiries, and community engagement. Visual content in the form of images is being shared, adding a visual element to the conversation.

Notes: The community seems to be actively involved in hands-on projects, which aligns with the principles of participatory design. The Designer's involvement in guiding and encouraging experimentation is fostering a collaborative learning environment. The use of images could enhance the communication and learning experience within the community.

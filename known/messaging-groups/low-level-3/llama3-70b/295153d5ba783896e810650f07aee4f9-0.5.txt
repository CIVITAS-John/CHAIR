You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (32 in total):
1. {an interpretation of message 1}

32. {an interpretation of message 32}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary codes: **polite expression**: user 4233 excuses themselves
2. Designer-2: Group sharing.
Preliminary codes: **idea suggestion**: designer 2 suggests group sharing
3. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
Preliminary codes: **download instructions**: designer 1 provides instructions on how to download the software
4. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
Preliminary codes: **development roadmap**: designer 1 shares the development plan and invites feedback
5. User-4234: [Emoji 2-56]
Preliminary codes: emoji
6. User-4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]
Preliminary codes: **emotional response**: user 4232 expresses excitement or enthusiasm
7. User-4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer-1: Hello :)
9. User-4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer-1: [Image 2-61] Updates in preparation
11. Designer-1: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
12. Designer-1: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
13. User-4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer-1: What problems did you encounter during use?
15. Designer-1: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
16. User-4235: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school
17. User-4235: Need the user manual for this software
18. Designer-1: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
19. User-4232: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
20. Designer-1: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer-1: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
22. User-4235: Can you also include mechanics experiments?
23. Designer-1: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer-1: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
25. User-4232: Oh, this is nice
26. Designer-1: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
27. User-4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer-1: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application
29. User-4234: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji 2-80]
30. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
31. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer-1: Hmm.

Thoughts: 
For this initial coding, I will focus on understanding the context and intent behind each message. I'll explore how the designers and users interact, what features are being discussed, and how the online community is emerging. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective, examining how the designers are facilitating the community's growth and how users are engaging with the Physics Lab platform. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll analyze how the designers are incorporating user feedback and iterating on the platform's development. Finally, I'll look at the participatory design aspects, noting how users are influencing the development roadmap.

Summary:
The conversation begins with users greeting each other and the designers. The designers share updates, development plans, and features, and invite feedback from the users. Users respond with enthusiasm, ask questions, and suggest features. The designers engage with the users, providing explanations and acknowledging their comments. The conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab, with users influencing the development roadmap and designers incorporating user feedback.

Notes:
* The designers are actively engaging with users, providing updates, and inviting feedback.
* Users are expressing enthusiasm and suggesting features, indicating a sense of ownership and investment in the platform.

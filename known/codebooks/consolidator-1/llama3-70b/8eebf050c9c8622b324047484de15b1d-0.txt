You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Did you make categories too large?
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Revise and rewrite the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* conceptual understanding
* integrating technology
=> Technology-Enhanced Learning

* designing learning spaces
=> Designing Learning Spaces (no change, as it's a significant category)

# Reflection
Upon reviewing the draft merging plan, I noticed that:

* The category "Technology-Enhanced Learning" might be a bit broad, but it's a good starting point.
* There are no obvious large categories that need to be broken down.
* The naming seems accurate, but it's essential to ensure that the new category name concisely covers the aspects of the merged categories.

Considering the research question and the context of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, I didn't identify any other categories for merging at this stage.

# Final Merging
* conceptual understanding
* integrating technology
=> Technology-Enhanced Learning

* designing learning spaces
=> Designing Learning Spaces (no change)

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary phrases: providing examples; explaining features; building understanding
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary phrases: offering advice; suggesting approach; expressing wisdom
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary phrases: responding thoughtfully; considering feedback; building rapport
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

Summary: This conversation appears to be a collaborative discussion between the designers and users of Physics Lab, with a focus on understanding the context and goals of the project. The designers are seeking input and feedback from the users, while also sharing their own ideas and plans. The users are offering advice and wisdom, and the conversation is characterized by a sense of mutual respect and building trust.

Notes: It seems that the designers are taking a participatory design approach, involving the users in the development process and seeking their input. This may help to build a sense of ownership and community among the users. The conversation also reveals a focus on understanding and learning, with the designers and users working together to clarify concepts and build knowledge.

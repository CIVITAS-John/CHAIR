7. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.
8. Designer: That's true.
9. Designer: Let's just click on ads, hh.
10. P14: Yes, that's fine.
11. P2: What's wrong with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
12. P2: A middle schooler is better than you.
13. P11: I just hope that ads won't take up too much space on the interface.
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood.
15. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method.
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: The ads won't be permanent.
19. Designer: We just want you to click on ads to earn points, and then use the points to unlock new content.
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come and hit me along the network cable.
21. P2: I know how to code.
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 280]
24. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is really annoying.
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen isn't big and it's still got psoriasis.
27. P2: It even forces you to click.
28. P2: What do you need ads for, @Designer 
29. Designer: Health...
30. Designer: Doing this requires hiring people...
31. P1: It's free.
32. Designer: Actually, it's similar to charging money, but if you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay...
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do more of it.
35. Designer: There are some other ways as well.
36. P8: The points wall is okay.
37. P8: @Designer I think it's okay.
38. P14: I also think it's great.
39. Designer: Actually, you can learn that mini program.
40. Designer: Creating questions, reviewing questions, and answering questions.
41. P14: What do you mean?
42. P14: [Image 299]
43. P17: Brain Out.
44. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
45. P18: Just downloaded it.

Thoughts: The conversation revolves around various aspects of user interaction with the "Physics Lab" software, focusing on payment methods, advertisements, and user engagement through gamification (points system). The dialogue between the designer and users (mostly P14 and P2) reveals concerns about usability for younger users and the intrusiveness of ads. There seems to be a brainstorming session about potential solutions to make the software more accessible and engaging. The mention of 3D Touch and other features suggests a discussion about technological enhancements. The community's feedback and the designer's responses highlight a collaborative development process. It will be important to analyze how these interactions influence the community's structure and the software's evolution.

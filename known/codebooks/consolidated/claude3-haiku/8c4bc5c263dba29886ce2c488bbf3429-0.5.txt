You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between sub-codes. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1. Software Access and User Inquiries
Relationship: The sub-codes of "user inquiries or questions about the software or its use" and "discussions or inquiries related to accessing or using the software, and statements about the availability and accessibility of the software or platform" are closely related, as they both pertain to the community's engagement with accessing and using the online physics lab software.
Criteria: This code captures discussions, questions, and inquiries related to accessing, downloading, and using the online physics lab software, as well as statements about the availability and accessibility of the platform.
Label: Software Access and User Inquiries

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: requesting technical support; seeking customization options; expressing frustration with current avatar
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about platform compatibility; showing interest in pc version
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: responding to technical request; offering assistance; inquiring about user's role
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: identifying as a teacher; disclosing occupational role
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: I will analyze this conversation from the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will consider how the designers and users interact, what kinds of questions and requests are being made, and how the designers respond to them. I will also think about how the community is emerging and how the designers are facilitating this emergence.

Interpretations for each message:

1. sharing an image; 
2. requesting technical support for avatar customization; expressing frustration with current avatar limitations; 
3. inquiring about PC version availability; 
4. responding to technical request; offering assistance; inquiring about user's role; 
5. identifying as a teacher; disclosing occupational role; 
6. sharing development plan and download address; announcing community resources; 
7. inviting users to contribute suggestions and requirements; establishing open communication channel; 
8. making a feature request; suggesting specific topics for demonstration; 
9. prioritizing development tasks; estimating development timeline; 
10. planning for future community engagement; committing to gather opinions; 
11. expressing gratitude; acknowledging designer's effort; 
12. inquiring about PC/interactive whiteboard version; seeking download link; 
13. expressing gratitude; confirming access to group files;

Summary: This conversation marks the beginning of the Physics Lab online community. The designers and users are getting acquainted, and the designers are setting the tone for open communication and community engagement. The users are already making feature requests and inquiring about the development plan, which the designers are responding to. The community is emerging as a collaborative space where users can contribute their ideas and requirements.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the designers are taking a participatory design approach by inviting users to contribute their suggestions and requirements. This might be a key factor in building trust and commitment within the community. The users are already showing interest in specific topics, such as mechanical waves and optical experiments, which could be a valuable input for the designers. I'm curious to see how the designers will balance their development plan with the emerging needs and requests from the community.

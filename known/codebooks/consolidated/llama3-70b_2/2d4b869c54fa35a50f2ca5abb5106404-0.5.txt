You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: reflect on past experience
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

2.
Label: linked to electromagnetism progress
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

3.
Label: indicating the software's appeal to a broad range of educators
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

4.
Label: apologized for late night communication
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

5.
Label: demonstrating transparency in development process
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

6.
Label: appreciation of plans
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

7.
Label: expressing that the software should be compatible with machines from 2008 onwards
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

8.
Label: expanding on user suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

9.
Label: especially for all in one touch screen machines without physical keyboards
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

11.
Label: providing broader context
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

12.
Label: clarifying update availability
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

13.
Label: seeking contextual information

Label: use emoji for greeting
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

18.
Label: emphasize convenience
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

19.
Label: designer 2 explores usability
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

20.

- Designer: Group sharing.

21.
Label: user 4232 identifies gaps in current software
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

22.
Label: express concern about memory
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

23.
Label: initiate communication
Quotes:
- User: Hello everyone

24.
Label: enhancing educational value of simulations
Quotes:

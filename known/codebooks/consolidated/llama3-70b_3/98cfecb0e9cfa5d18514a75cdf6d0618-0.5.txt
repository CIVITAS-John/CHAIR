You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: noting design tension, suggesting design limitations
- Participants experience tension between designing for novice and expert users, noting limited options and tension between novice and expert design needs.
- Participants suggest design limitations for expert users, identifying a steep learning curve, and reflect on the design suitability of the current system for experts.

2.
Concepts: identifying learning challenges, identifies the concept of "scope" as a challenge
- Participants identify "scope" as a learning challenge in NetLogo and struggle with scope and context challenges.
- The participant identifies the concept of "scope" as a challenge in programming, particularly for beginners.

3.
Concepts: highlighting novice struggles, highlighting challenges in helping novices
- Participants reflect on and highlight novice struggles.
- Participants highlight the challenges of novices seeking help due to lack of context in their queries.

4.
Concepts: recognizing coding challenges, identifying debugging challenges
- Participants recognize the challenges of coding in bulk, especially for beginners, and the challenges of intermittent coding.
- Participants describe the challenges of debugging and identifying errors, highlighting the lack of debugging skills among beginners.

5.
Concepts: uses older netlogo versions, codes in older netlogo versions
- Participants use older NetLogo versions and face compatibility issues.
- Participants write code in older NetLogo versions due to AI's database limitations.

6.
Concepts: integrating ai-generated code
- The interviewee integrates AI-generated code fully.
- Participants integrate AI-generated code into their model or project, deciding to copy and use the code.

7.
Concepts: encouraging early help-seeking with ai
- Participants suggest AI can encourage early help-seeking and reduce costs.
- Participants encourage early and frequent help-seeking behavior and emphasize the importance of ease in seeking help.

Phrase: Experience design limitations

2.
Concepts: identifying learning challenges, identifies the concept of "scope" as a challenge
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both focus on the challenges of learning NetLogo, with the first concept identifying general learning challenges and the second concept highlighting the specific challenge of "scope".
Criteria: Participants identify challenges in learning NetLogo, particularly with regards to understanding the concept of "scope".
Phrase: Identify learning challenges

3.
Concepts: highlighting novice struggles, highlighting challenges in helping novices
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both focus on the difficulties faced by novice users, with the first concept highlighting their struggles and the second concept highlighting the challenges of providing help.
Criteria: Participants highlight the struggles of novice users and the challenges of providing them with effective help.
Phrase: Highlight novice struggles

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: discuss technical limitations, highlight technical constraints and challenges
- Designers discuss limitations faced by the team and explain technical limitations of the software.
- Users highlight technical constraints and discuss challenges related to computer systems.

2.
Concepts: adapt designs to user needs, align features with needs
- Designers identify necessary adaptations in design and commit to providing solutions that meet user needs.
- Designers align feature development with user needs by discussing functionality enhancements and necessary adjustments to existing features.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: discuss technical limitations, highlight technical constraints and challenges
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve the communication of challenges and limitations, focusing on the technical aspects faced by the team and users.
Criteria: Designers and users communicate about the technical limitations and constraints encountered, providing insights into the challenges associated with the software and computer systems.
Phrase: Address technical challenges

2.
Concepts: adapt designs to user needs, align features with needs
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as they both pertain to the designers' efforts to modify and enhance designs and features to better meet the requirements of users.
Criteria: Designers assess user needs and make necessary adaptations to designs and features to ensure alignment with those needs.
Phrase: Tailor designs to user needs

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label: A label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

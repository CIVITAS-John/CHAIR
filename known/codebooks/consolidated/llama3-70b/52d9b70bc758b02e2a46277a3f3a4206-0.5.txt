You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

4.
Label: developing an understanding of the ai's limitations
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that.

5.
Label: demonstrating strategic ai interaction
Quotes:
- E01: I have I found with with playing with with ChatGPT. And I was something at Python, I think I tried to give it the code. And I tried to run it generated error.

And I say, Can you fix that?  (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug in the generated code, he refers to his previous practice with asking ChatGPT to debug with the code, the error message, and the line number. Interviewer did what E01 said.

Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help.

11.
Label: reflecting on how professionals learn they learn in fragments
Quotes:

12.
Label: envisions ai facilitating personalized learning paths
Quotes:

13.
Label: comparing ai output to known resources
Quotes:
- E04: I know that Perceptron model exists in the NetLogo model library.

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
  Yes, "community engagement" and "user interaction" could potentially be merged since they both deal with how users interact within the community.
  
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
  The current draft does not appear to have over-merged categories, as each merged category still maintains a focused scope.

- Is any naming inaccurate?
  The names seem accurate but could be refined for clarity. For example, "educational aspects" might be better named "educational impact and context" to be more descriptive.

# Final Merging
* educational impact
* educational contexts
=> educational impact and context

* community dynamics
* social bonding
=> social interaction

* technical specifications
* technical updates
=> technical details

* community engagement
* user interaction
=> user engagement

* professional background
=> professional context

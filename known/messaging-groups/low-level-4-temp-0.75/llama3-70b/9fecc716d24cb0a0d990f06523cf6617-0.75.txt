You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: As I begin analyzing this conversation, I'm considering the role of the designers in facilitating the community's emergence. I'm also thinking about how the users' backgrounds and experiences might influence their interactions with the Physics Lab online community. I'm wondering how the designers' updates and announcements might shape the users' expectations and engagement. From a participatory design perspective, I'm looking for instances of co-design or feature suggestions that might indicate a sense of ownership or agency among users. 

Interpretations for each message:

1. establishing teaching credentials; sharing relevant experience
2. announcing software update; managing user expectations
3. acknowledging potential disruption; expressing consideration for users
4. requesting technical guidance; seeking clarification on software access
5. showing politeness; defusing potential tension
6. proposing collaborative functionality; exploring user needs
7. providing download instructions; directing user to resource
8. outlining development roadmap; soliciting user feedback and suggestions
9. expressing enthusiasm or playfulness; using emoji to convey tone
10. mirroring emotional tone; building rapport with fellow user

Summary: The conversation begins with a user sharing their professional background, followed by designers providing updates on the software and its development roadmap. The users then ask questions, apologize, and engage with each other and the designers. The designers respond with guidance, apologies, and solicitations for feedback. The tone is generally polite and collaborative, with users and designers working together to clarify software access and explore new features.

Notes: It seems that the designers are taking a proactive role in engaging with users and setting expectations. The users, on the other hand, are seeking guidance and clarification while also building relationships with each other. I'm hypothesizing that this collaborative tone might be crucial in the emergence of the online community. I'm also curious about the role of emojis in conveying tone and building rapport.

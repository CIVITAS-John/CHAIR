6.
Label: considering future expansions
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

7.
Label: ask followup question on user request
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

9.
Label: user 4232 identifies gaps in existing software
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

Label: reiterates need
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

17.
Label: acknowledgement
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- User: [Emoji]
- User: This idea is really good

22.
Label: user 4232 suggests exit button

23.
Label: designer 1 provides ideal component information
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

24.

Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible.

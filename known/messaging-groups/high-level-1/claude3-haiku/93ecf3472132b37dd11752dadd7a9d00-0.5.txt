Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the community's emergence.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
# Label of category 1

1. P11: I will consider the impedance.
2. P11: Hmm, I just updated to the latest version.
3. P11: Thank you.
4. P12: My sister just found a chat group where the group owner has gone crazy and keeps sending out red packets. The group code is 695176754, everyone hurry and grab them.
5. P5: ã€‚

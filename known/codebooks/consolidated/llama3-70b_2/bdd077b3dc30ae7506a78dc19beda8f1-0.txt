You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: seeking help from ai, seek ai assistance
Relationship: The concepts are synonymous, both referring to the act of requesting support from AI-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants seek help, clarification, or AI-generated code from AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Seek AI assistance.

2.
Concepts: explore ai capabilities, ai ability (?): ai's potentiality for support learning
Relationship: The concepts are related, with "explore AI capabilities" being a means to understand "AI's potentiality for support learning".
Criteria: Participants explore AI capabilities to envision potential for learning pathways and supporting collaborative learning.
Phrase: Explore AI's potential.

3.
Concepts: queries ai for code structures, identifies missing code elements
Relationship: The concepts are sequential, with "querying AI for code structures" leading to "identifying missing code elements".
Criteria: Participants query AI for missing code structures to identify gaps in the generated code.
Phrase: Query AI for code structures.

4.
Concepts: adapts to ai-generated code, integrating ai-generated code into workflow
Relationship: The concepts are related, with "adapting to AI-generated code" being a necessary step for "integrating AI-generated code into workflow".
Criteria: Participants adapt to AI-generated code and integrate it into their workflow.
Phrase: Integrate AI-generated code.

5.
Concepts: warns about ai errors, acknowledging ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related, with "warning about AI errors" being a consequence of "acknowledging AI limitations".
Criteria: Participants warn about potential AI errors and acknowledge AI limitations.
Phrase: Acknowledge AI limitations.

6.
Concepts: debugging with ai assistance, improve debugging with ai
Relationship: The concepts are related, with "debugging with AI assistance" being a means to "improve debugging with AI".
Criteria: Participants use AI for debugging assistance to improve and iterate on the debugging process.
Phrase: Debug with AI assistance.

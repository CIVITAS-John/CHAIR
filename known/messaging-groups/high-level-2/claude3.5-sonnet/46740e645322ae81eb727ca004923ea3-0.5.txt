Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

This conversation involves a designer asking about uploading a high-definition avatar, and a user inquiring if it's for the PC version. The designer then asks if the user is a teacher, to which the user confirms.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we'll focus on aspects of community emergence, user engagement, and platform development. We'll examine the interaction between designers and users, the role of customization in user experience, and how the platform caters to specific user groups like teachers. Key questions to consider: How does avatar customization contribute to user engagement? How do designers interact with users to gather information and improve the platform? What role do teachers play in the Physics Lab community?

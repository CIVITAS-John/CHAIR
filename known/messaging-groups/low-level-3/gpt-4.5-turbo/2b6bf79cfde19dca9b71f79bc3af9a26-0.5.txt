You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Thoughts: The analysis of this conversation segment from the Physics Lab's online community can provide insights into how members communicate, agree, and share knowledge within a digital environment. By examining the interactions through the lens of learning sciences, it's crucial to identify how members of the community use informal language and symbols (like "+1") to facilitate learning and mutual understanding. From a human-computer interaction perspective, understanding how users adapt to and leverage the platform's features for communication reflects on the usability and user experience design of the system. Lastly, participatory design aspects can be explored by observing how community feedback (like questions and answers about community-specific language) potentially influences the evolution of the platform's communicative practices.

Tags for each message:
1. self-deprecating humor; community interaction; social bonding
2. agreement expression; community solidarity; social interaction
3. agreement expression; community solidarity; social interaction
4. agreement expression; community solidarity; social interaction
5. inquiry about community slang; seeking clarification; user engagement
6. clarification provided; community support; knowledge sharing
7. clarification of community slang; reinforcing community norms; knowledge sharing
8. expression of hesitation; non-verbal filler; communication nuance
9. suggestion for self-directed learning; use of external resources; proactive problem-solving

Summary: The conversation revolves around the use of "+1" within the community, indicating agreement or shared opinion. Participants P13, P14, P15, and P16 use this term to show solidarity and community bonding. P10, unsure of the term's meaning, seeks clarification, which is provided by P11 and further reinforced by P13. This interaction highlights how community-specific language facilitates quick and efficient communication among members while also posing barriers to newcomers. P13's use of "emmmm" and the suggestion to use Baidu for more information suggests a reliance on external resources and self-learning within the community.

Notes: The use of "+1" as a quick agreement tool may indicate a culture of consensus or a norm of minimalistic interaction in the community. The inquiry by P10 and the responses it elicited show an inclusive aspect of the community, willing to educate and integrate newcomers. The suggestion by P13 to use Baidu indicates an aspect of self-reliance and encouragement towards self-directed learning within the community. Further observation is needed to understand how these interactions influence the overall participatory design and user experience of the Physics Lab platform.

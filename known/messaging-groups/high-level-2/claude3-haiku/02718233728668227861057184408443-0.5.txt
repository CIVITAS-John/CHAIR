Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. P4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. P4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

* Summary
The conversation in the Physics Lab online message group discusses the development plan and features of the Physics Lab software, with a focus on the mechanical and optical experiments that the community would like to see implemented. The conversation also touches on the process of uploading high-quality avatars and the availability of the PC/interactive whiteboard version of the software.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, I will focus on the following aspects:

1. Learning Sciences:
   - Identify the types of physics experiments and demonstrations that the community is interested in, and how these align with best practices in physics education.
   - Examine the community's role in shaping the development of the software to meet their learning needs.

2. Human-Computer Interaction:
   - Understand the community's preferences and expectations regarding the user interface and features of the software.
   - Analyze the communication and collaboration dynamics within the group, and how they influence the software development process.

3. Participatory Design:
   - Explore the extent to which the community is involved in the design and development of the Physics Lab software.
   - Identify the strategies used by the designer to engage with the community and incorporate their feedback.

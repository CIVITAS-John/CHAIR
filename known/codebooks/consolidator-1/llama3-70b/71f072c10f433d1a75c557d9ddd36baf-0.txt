You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is merged from multiple ones. Consolidate into a single label and criteria that covers all concepts. Labels and criteria should be clear and generalizable, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: 
To categorize the codes related to the research question, I will group them into theory-informed categories that align with the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will consolidate the codes into labels and criteria that capture the essence of each concept, avoiding unnecessary specifics or examples.

Here are the categorized codes:

1.
Label: Humorous Interactions
Criteria: Instances of humor, playfulness, or lightheartedness in the conversation to establish a tone and build relationships.
Category: Social Dynamics

2.
Label: Visual Communication
Criteria: Sharing of images to convey information, facilitate understanding, or illustrate a point.
Category: Communication Approach

3.
Label: Inquiry-Based Dialogue
Criteria: Asking open-ended questions to clarify, seek understanding, stimulate discussion, or seek clarification.
Category: Collaborative Inquiry

4.
Label: Designer Facilitation
Criteria: Instances of designer intervention, feedback, guidance, or setting boundaries in the conversation.
Category: Facilitation Strategies

5.
Label: Community Guidelines
Criteria: Implicit or explicit references to norms or expectations within the community, establishing or reinforcing respect and participation.
Category: Community Governance

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: considering feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm.

2.
Label: providing timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

3.
Label: brainstorming solutions
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

4.
Label: evaluating software usability
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

5.
Label: outlining future plans
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

6.
Label: gathering user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

7.
Label: providing individualized attention
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

8.
Label: seeking guidance on pc version usage
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

9.
Label: explaining development process
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

10.
Label: offering wisdom
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

Label: inquiring about progress
Quotes:
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]

12.
Label: consulting authorities
Quotes:

13.
Label: requesting specific physics demonstrations
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

14.
Label: sharing institutional goals
Quotes:
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

15.
Label: awaiting suitable opportunity

Label: inviting collaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

17.
Label: considering user interface design
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

18.
Label: providing encouragement
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

19.
Label: encouraging open feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

20.
Label: suggesting new feature
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (15 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
15. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary phrases: announcing changes; explaining updates; providing rationales; setting new standards; refining simulations
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary phrases: introducing new features; explaining functionality; highlighting benefits; promoting ideal components; guiding users
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary phrases: soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; seeking input; fostering collaboration
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary phrases: seeking guidance; requesting instructions; expressing confusion; needing clarification
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary phrases: providing technical information; explaining limitations; setting boundaries; clarifying compatibility
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I plan to focus on understanding the interactions between designers and users in the Physics Lab online community. I'll examine the language used, the tone, and the intent behind each message. I'll consider how the designers are shaping the community's norms and expectations, and how users are responding to these cues. I'll also look for signs of collaboration, feedback, and mutual support. Guiding questions include: How are designers establishing their authority and expertise? How are users influencing the development of Physics Lab? What role does feedback play in shaping the community's dynamics?

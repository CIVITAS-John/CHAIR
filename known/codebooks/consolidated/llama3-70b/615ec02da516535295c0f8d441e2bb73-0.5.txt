You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: agree with focus
Quotes:
- User: Indeed

2.
Label: give examples of feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

3.
Label: align with educational tool development
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

4.
Label: greeting
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
- User: Hello everyone
- Designer: Hello :)

5.
Label: announce component change
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

6.

10.
Label: prompting user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

11.
Label: assure manual editing
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

12.
Label: make detailed feature request
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

13.
Label: share info on app release
Quotes:
- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

14.
Label: provide assurance
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

15.
Label: describe new components
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

16.
Label: praise software practicality
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

17.
Label: suggestions of interactions
Quotes:
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

18.
Label: provide design preference
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

19.
Label: seek feedback on specific detail
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

20.
Label: promise to make the feature on a later time
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

21.
Label: propose workflow enhancement
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

22.
Label: resolution
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

23.
Label: acknowledge help
Quotes:
- User: Thank you.

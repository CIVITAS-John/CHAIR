You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: provided information
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

2.
Label: indirect reject
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

3.
Label: compliment
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: This idea is really good

Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

17.
Label: adding experimental details
Quotes:

22.
Label: explain bidirectional conversion
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

23.
Label: inquiring about the availability of a pc version of the platform
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

24.
Label: seek support
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

25.
Label: fosters a positive and appreciative atmosphere
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

27.
Label: explaining the focus on electricity and mechanics, and the potential for future expansion
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

28.
Label: offer a solution
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

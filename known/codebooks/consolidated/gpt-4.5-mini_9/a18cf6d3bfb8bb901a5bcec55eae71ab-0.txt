You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: note ai's limitations in error resolution, acknowledges ai's error limitations
- Interviewees note that the AI can still produce errors, indicating limitations in its reliability.
- Users acknowledge the iterative nature of debugging with AI, despite its errors, and appreciate AI's troubleshooting capabilities while noting its limitations.

2.
Concepts: compares ai-generated code, evaluates ai responses for decision-making
- Users evaluate the effectiveness of AI in generating code based on specific prompts and compare AI-generated code with their own to evaluate improvements.
- Users evaluate AI responses to make informed decisions about coding tasks and evaluate error messages and outputs before making decisions in their coding process.

3.
Concepts: expresses user satisfaction, appreciate clarity in ai responses
- Instances where users express satisfaction with the AI's capabilities or features and usability.
- Users express satisfaction with the clarity of AI's explanations and its ability to accommodate different user expertise levels.

4.
Concepts: envision ai collaboration, advocate for collaborative ai in programming
- Users highlight the collaborative nature of working with AI in programming.
- Interviewees advocate for the efficiency of collaborative programming enhanced by AI.

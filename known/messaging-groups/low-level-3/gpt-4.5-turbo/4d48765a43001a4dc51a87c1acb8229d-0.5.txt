You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Thoughts: This conversation snippet provides a window into the social dynamics and learning behaviors within the Physics Lab's online community. The use of "+1" as a form of agreement or endorsement indicates a shared understanding or shorthand communication among members. P10's inquiry about the meaning of "+1" suggests new or less experienced members are actively learning community norms. The responses from P11 and P13 not only help in community building by supporting new members but also reflect different levels of engagement; from direct explanations to suggesting self-reliance through external resources like Baidu. P14 and P17's messages, though not directly related to the "+1" discussion, hint at other ongoing conversations about resources and usage, possibly indicating a broader context of community interaction around lab resource management. P4's "No problem" could be seen as a form of social lubricant, facilitating smooth interactions.

1. agreement confirmation; social interaction
2. seeking clarification; community learning
3. explanation given; community support
4. clarification provided; community engagement
5. non-verbal filler; communication style
6. advice to use external resources; self-directed learning
7. acknowledgment; gratitude expressed
8. agreement expression; community participation
9. resource management discussion; indirect communication
10. browsing behavior; non-committal interaction
11. supportive response; community politeness

Summary: The conversation reveals a community actively engaging in both social and informational exchanges. Members use shorthand communications like "+1" to express agreement, and there's a mix of direct support and encouragement for self-learning. The dialogue around lab resource management suggests practical concerns are also a topic of community interaction. Newer members are being acclimatized to the community's norms and language, indicating an evolving community dynamic.

Notes: The use of "+1" and the interaction around it could be indicative of the community's maturity and the informal rules that guide communication. The suggestion to use external resources like Baidu for self-learning reflects an encouragement of autonomy within the community. The mention of lab resources and browsing behavior might suggest underlying themes of resource allocation and usage, which could be crucial for understanding the community's operational dynamics. Further analysis could explore how these elements contribute to the community's cohesion and growth.

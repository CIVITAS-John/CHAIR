You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: designing for usability and usefulness, adapting to user contexts and technical constraints
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected, as designing for usability and usefulness is influenced by adapting to user contexts and technical constraints.
Criteria: Designers consider user needs and technical requirements to create effective and functional software.
Phrase: Designing with contextual adaptability

2.
Concepts: envisioning future development, planning future engagement and consultation
Relationship: The concepts are sequential, as envisioning future development leads to planning future engagement and consultation.
Criteria: Designers and users outline future plans and collaborate to ensure continued software improvement.

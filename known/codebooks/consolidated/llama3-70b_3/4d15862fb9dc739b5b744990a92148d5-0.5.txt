You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

17.
Label: adding experimental details
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

18.
Label: acknowledging the ability to manually adjust the layout
Quotes:
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

19.
Label: sharing research direction
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

- User: PC version?

22.
Label: revealing a knowledge gap
Quotes:
- User: How to download?

23.
Label: humor
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

25.
Label: outlining system requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

26.
Label: promoting iterative refinement
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

27.
Label: discussion of further interests
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

28.

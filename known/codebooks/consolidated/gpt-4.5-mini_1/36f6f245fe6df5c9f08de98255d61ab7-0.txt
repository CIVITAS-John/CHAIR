You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: identify ai limitations, experience debugging challenges
- Interviewees observe and express frustration regarding the AI's failures and its inability to resolve specific coding errors.
- Interviewee expresses frustration with AI's incorrect error reporting despite correct code.

2.
Concepts: code review, engage in code debugging
- Interviewees review AI-generated code to identify and resolve issues independently.
- Interviewees actively engage in debugging AI-generated code and manually review it when the AI's solutions do not meet expectations.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. 
Concepts: identify ai limitations, experience debugging challenges
Relationship: The concepts are related as both involve the interviewees' recognition of the AI's shortcomings and the resulting difficulties they face in debugging due to these limitations.
Criteria: Interviewees identify the limitations of the AI and express frustration with its inability to effectively assist in debugging coding errors.
Phrase: Recognize AI shortcomings and face debugging difficulties.

2. 
Concepts: code review, engage in code debugging
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as both involve the interviewees' proactive efforts to assess and rectify issues in AI-generated code through independent review and debugging.
Criteria: Interviewees conduct code reviews and actively engage in debugging to resolve issues in AI-generated code when it does not meet their expectations.
Phrase: Review and debug AI-generated code.

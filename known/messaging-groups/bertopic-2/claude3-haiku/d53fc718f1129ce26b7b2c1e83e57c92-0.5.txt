You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Create multiple interpretations for both the interviewee's verbal response and the interviewer's observations. Take note of emotions explicitly or implicitly expressed by the interviewee. Code through the lens of human-computer interaction and learning sciences.

Always follow the output format:

Thought: {What is the most common theme among the input quotes? Do not over-interpret the data.}
Phrase: {A single verb phrase that faithfully describes the topic}

Quotes:
- E01: I had a problem and I couldn't figure out how to solve this problem. I finally got online and I discovered there was this user group that would help you for free with problems. And it was stunning. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on seeking help online.
- E01: if you approach the user group politely, graciously, and instead of dropping your entire code on it, you go, I narrowed it down to this. I read this documentation. I tried these eight things with this answer and I'm perplexed. If somebody goes, they paste their problem and it's clearly their homework and they want someone else to do it for them. No, I'm not going to help with that. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on proper practices to seek online help: do your own work and clearly describe what you need/tried.

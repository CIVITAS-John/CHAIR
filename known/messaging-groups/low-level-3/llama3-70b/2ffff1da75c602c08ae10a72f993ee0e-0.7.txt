You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

Thoughts: I'll analyze this conversation through the lens of participatory design, considering how the designers and users interact and negotiate the online community's development. I'll investigate how the designers respond to user requests and how users engage with the designers. I'll also explore the role of technology and infrastructure in shaping the community.

Tags for each message:
1. Image sharing; designer-user interaction; online identity
2. Avatar customization; user request; community guidelines
3. Platform availability; user inquiry; technology integration

Summary: The conversation starts with an image shared by Designer-2, followed by a question from Designer-1 about uploading a high-definition avatar. User-4229 responds with a question about a PC version, potentially referring to the platform's availability on PC.

Notes: It appears that the designers are already engaging with users and responding to their requests. The conversation is centered around the platform's features and customization options. I hypothesize that the designers are actively seeking user feedback and input to shape the online community.

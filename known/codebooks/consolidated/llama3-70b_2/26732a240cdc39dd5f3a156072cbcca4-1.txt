You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: misleading
Quotes:
- E01: And some of them we still haven't been doing like hive mind, like how we are going to have the machine learning back from the user feedback or just from the compiler, right? You generate some code, but it doesn't work. So we have to tell you that this time, you didn't work. (interviewer's observation) The current ChatGPT implementation cannot check the generated code with external information (compiler, etc.) (partially solved by the Interpreter plugin, but only Python at this time)
- E04: I guess, in their databases, they still have like, NetLogo 5 in there and stuff. So like, for example, you know, the anonymous functions, they still use like, the old, sometimes I'll get like, the old functionality for the anonymous functions. (interviewer's observation) Writing code in older versions of NetLogo
- E01: So maybe the details are wrong and, you know, Michael Tamalo or somebody jumped on me because I posted some answer and it used some function that wasn't available. AI had hallucinated some function. (interviewer's observation) AI might hallucinates.
- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

2.
Label: outdated code
Quotes:

(interviewer's observation) Writing code in older versions of NetLogo

3.
Label: notes less technical language
Quotes:
- E04: It seems to explain things pretty well, it does not seems to be overly technical. (interviewer's observation) Provides clear, less technical explanations.

4.
Label: chatgpt ability (negative): errors in generating codes
Quotes:
- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

5.
Label: uses ai for debugging
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E04 was prompted to copy and paste error messages to ChatGPT.

6.
Label: chatgpt ability (positive): provides immediate feedback
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

7.
Label: code structure
Quotes:
- E04: "how to define breeds in netlogo" (interviewer's observation) E04 tries to find certain syntax structures from the AI-generated code and ask for it when it is not there.
- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

8.
Label: learning curve demands high investment of time
Quotes:
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time. (interviewer's observation) AI could potentially save time for learning new extensions (compared with core concepts) of NetLogo.

9.
Label: asks for checkerboard pattern
Quotes:
- E01: "please write a netlogo program that produces a checker board with black and white squares?" (interviewer's observation) E01 asks ChatLogo to create a checkerboard pattern.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Criteria: Expresses instances where the AI-generated code or response is incorrect, incomplete, or unreliable.
Label: Misleading Information

2.
Criteria: Refers to the AI-generated code being based on outdated versions of NetLogo or including outdated syntax.
Label: Outdated Code References

3.
Criteria: Describes the AI-generated explanations as clear and easy to understand, without using overly technical language.
Label: Accessible Explanations

4.
Criteria: Identifies instances where the AI-generated code is incomplete, missing essential elements, or contains errors.
Label: Code Generation Errors

5.
Criteria: Shows instances where the participant uses the AI to debug their code or asks the AI for help with error messages.
Label: AI-assisted Debugging

6.
Criteria: Expresses appreciation for the immediate feedback provided by the AI, which is not available through other means.
Label: Timely Feedback

7.
Criteria: Focuses on the structure of the code, including syntax and organization, and how the AI-generated code may be lacking in these aspects.
Label: Code Structure Issues

8.
Criteria: Describes the time and effort required to learn and master NetLogo, including the potential benefits of using AI to reduce this investment.
Label: Steep Learning Curve

9.
Criteria: Requests specific code examples or tasks, such as generating a checkerboard pattern, from the AI.
Label: Specific Code Requests

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P13: First year of high school
Preliminary tags: personal experience; educational level; community interaction
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
Preliminary tags: feature suggestion; technical details; community interaction
3. P2: @Designer 
Preliminary tags: feature suggestion; inquiry; community interaction
4. P17: [Image 1-198]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
Preliminary tags: inquiry; chemical usage; community interaction
6. P2: +1
Preliminary tags: agreement; brief expression; community interaction
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 1-202]
9. P14: How do you say it?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, they heat up quickly and save materials. But this is also fine, if you're a bit extravagant, you can cover a fish tank and connect a tube ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Won't the condensed liquid flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid has already been heated during reflux, making it less likely to break
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry things, probably won't be able to touch it before the second half of the year..
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be exactly the same as in the books, although during exams...
20. P1: There isn't any relatively realistic chemistry software at the moment
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was okay
22. Designer: But even the gods of organic chemistry can't solve it
23. Designer: So if you want to do it, you still have to consider it from the exam perspective
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section on electricity will have it, such as charged operations)
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a larger amount of computation...
32. P1: If you have the ability to make a comprehensive and free one, it should be very popular
33. P2: If the CPU is bad, it's game over
34. P11: Adding what you said, it wouldn't be "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
35. P1: It's a series of lab courses
36. P11: Hey, good idea
37. P2: Hehe
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is very annoying?
39. P2: @Designer Can you add a light sensor?
40. Designer: The problem is
41. Designer: Where does the light come from
42. P11: What about the light
43. Designer: Are you using a small bulb to illuminate the photoresistor?
44. P2: Tap with your hand
45. P14: I think there's no problem
46. Designer: Isn't that just a variable resistor, except the curve is different (â€¦â€¦)
47. P2: And a small light
48. Designer: Micro-payment maybe...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 1-245]
52. Designer: We'll see
53. Designer: If you don't have money, you can also click on ads
54. Designer: It's the approach of a conscientious game
55. P1: Put up ads
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: If you tap and release, it won't conduct electricity
58. Designer: Oh
59. Designer: Forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (â€¦â€¦)
60. P11: ðŸ˜‚
61. P11: Just about to say
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but that you don't know how to pay
63. P11: It can also be adapted to 3D touch
64. Designer: Just charge directly through the app store?

Thoughts: This conversation provides a rich dataset for understanding the emergence of the Physics Lab online community. Analyzing from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, I will focus on identifying how users interact with each other and the designer, how they contribute to the development of the platform, and how their educational and technical inquiries shape the community's growth. Guiding questions include: How do users' inquiries and suggestions reflect their learning needs? How does the designer respond to these inputs? What roles do images and brief expressions play in community interaction?

Summary: The conversation reveals a dynamic interaction between the designer and the community members of Physics Lab. Users frequently make feature suggestions, inquire about technical details, and share their educational experiences, reflecting their learning needs and curiosity. The designer responds with explanations, input on technical feasibility, and considerations for future updates, demonstrating a participatory design approach. Humor and brief expressions like "+1" and "oh" are common, indicating a casual and engaged community atmosphere. Visual communication through image sharing also plays a significant role in discussions. Monetization strategies and payment methods are briefly touched upon, highlighting the practical aspects of sustaining the platform.

Notes: The community's interaction style is informal yet focused on educational and technical content. Users' inquiries and suggestions are valuable for understanding their learning needs and preferences. The designer's active participation and responsiveness are crucial for community engagement and platform development. Future analysis could explore the impact of humor and brief expressions on community cohesion and the effectiveness of visual communication in educational discussions.

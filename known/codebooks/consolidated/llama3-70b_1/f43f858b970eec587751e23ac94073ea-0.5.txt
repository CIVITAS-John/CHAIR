You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: appreciates time-saving benefits, values time-saving aspects of ai
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as appreciating time-saving benefits implies valuing the time-saving aspects of AI.
Criteria: Participants perceive AI as saving time in learning and performing tasks and express a positive view of its time-saving ability.
Phrase: Values time-saving benefits of AI.

2.
Concepts: finds interface intuitive, describes intuitive interface
Relationship: The concepts are synonymous, as finding an interface intuitive implies describing it as such.
Criteria: Participants find the interface easy to use and describe it as intuitive.
Phrase: Finds interface intuitive.

3.
Concepts: expresses frustration with ai, experiences ai-induced frustration
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as expressing frustration with AI implies experiencing frustration when using it.
Criteria: Participants express dissatisfaction and annoyance when using AI.
Phrase: Experiences AI-induced frustration.

4.
Concepts: evaluates ai-generated code, evaluates ai-generated code comparisons
Relationship: The concepts are related, as evaluating AI-generated code implies comparing it to human-written code or initial code.
Criteria: Participants assess and compare AI-generated code with other code types.
Phrase: Evaluates AI-generated code.

5.
Concepts: evaluation to debug, analyzes code for errors
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as evaluating code to debug implies analyzing it for errors.

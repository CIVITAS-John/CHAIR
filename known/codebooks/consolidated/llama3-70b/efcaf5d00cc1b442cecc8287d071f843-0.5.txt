You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: feedback invitation, inviting suggestions and feedback
- Designers invite users to participate in providing input or feedback, encouraging users to provide feedback or suggestions.
- Inviting users to provide suggestions, feedback, or input.

2.
Concepts: valuing user input, user input acknowledgement
- Designers value or acknowledge user input or feedback.
- Designers acknowledge user input or requests, accepting or acknowledging user suggestions or feedback, or soliciting suggestions from users for future development.

3.
Concepts: feature request
- Users request specific features or functionalities or a request for a new feature or functionality to improve user experience.
- The designer or user mentions or requests support for a specific component or feature in Physics Lab, requesting specific features or functionalities for physics simulations or mentioning a specific simulation or experimental setup in Physics Lab.

4.
Concepts: positive feedback
- Expressing a positive sentiment about an idea or feature.
- Users share positive experiences or outcomes from using a software or tool, expressing positive feedback about the software's usability or usefulness.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: feedback invitation, inviting suggestions and feedback
Relationship: Inclusion (inviting suggestions and feedback is a way of extending an invitation for feedback)
Criteria: Designers explicitly ask users to provide input, suggestions, or feedback on Physics Lab's development.
Label: Soliciting User Input

2.
Concepts: valuing user input, user input acknowledgement
Relationship: Parallel (valuing user input and acknowledging user input are two related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Designers demonstrate appreciation for user feedback or suggestions, and acknowledge their value in shaping Physics Lab's development.
Label: User Input Appreciation

3.
Concepts: feature request
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Users or designers explicitly mention a specific feature or functionality desired for Physics Lab, or request support for a particular component or simulation.
Label: Feature Request

4.
Concepts: positive feedback
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Users express a positive sentiment or opinion about an idea, feature, or Physics Lab's usability and usefulness.
Label: Positive Feedback

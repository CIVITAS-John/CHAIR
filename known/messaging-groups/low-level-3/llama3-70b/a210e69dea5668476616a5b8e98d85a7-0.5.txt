You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. P2: What about superconductors?
Preliminary tags: superconductors inquiry; physics concept; technical detail
2. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a larger amount of computation...
Preliminary tags: chemistry simulation; computational complexity; educational challenge
3. P1: If you have the ability to make a comprehensive and free one, it should be very popular
Preliminary tags: comprehensive software; educational resource; learning tool
4. P2: If the CPU is bad, it's game over
5. P11: Adding what you said, it wouldn't be "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: It's a series of lab courses
7. P11: Hey, good idea
8. P2: Hehe
9. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is very annoying?
10. P2: @Designer Can you add a light sensor?
11. Designer: The problem is
12. Designer: Where does the light come from
13. P11: What about the light
14. Designer: Are you using a small bulb to illuminate the photoresistor?
15. P2: Tap with your hand
16. P14: I think there's no problem
17. Designer: Isn't that just a variable resistor, except the curve is different (â€¦â€¦)
18. P2: And a small light
19. Designer: Micro-payment maybe...
20. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
21. P2: ï¼Ÿ
22. P14: [Image 1-245]
23. Designer: We'll see
24. Designer: If you don't have money, you can also click on ads
25. Designer: It's the approach of a conscientious game
26. P1: Put up ads
27. Designer: Hmm.
28. P2: If you tap and release, it won't conduct electricity
29. Designer: Oh
30. Designer: Forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (â€¦â€¦)
31. P11: ðŸ˜‚
32. P11: Just about to say
33. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but that you don't know how to pay
34. P11: It can also be adapted to 3D touch
35. Designer: Just charge directly through the app store?

Thoughts: 
For this conversation, I plan to analyze the emergence of the Physics Lab online community through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will focus on identifying how participants engage with each other, share ideas, and negotiate meanings around the development of Physics Lab. I will also explore how the Designer responds to user suggestions and how the community shapes the development of the platform. Guiding questions include: How do participants use technical details to inform their discussions? How does the Designer facilitate or hinder the conversation? What are the power dynamics at play in this online community?

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: values ai feedback, values prompt feedback from ai
- Users value the feedback from AI that contributes to code optimization.
- Users appreciate and prioritize receiving fast feedback and responses during the coding process from AI.

2.
Concepts: debug ai-generated code, manually corrects ai code errors
- Users engage in self-led debugging efforts to identify and rectify errors in AI-generated code.
- Users engage in a process of reviewing and rectifying coding errors that arise in AI-generated code outputs.

3.
Concepts: acknowledge processing limitations, acknowledges ai limitations with large code
- Users acknowledge the limitations AI faces in processing extensive lines of code.
- Users recognize and discuss the constraints of AI performance when encountering extensive code segments or large datasets.

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: values ai feedback, values prompt feedback from ai  
Relationship: Both concepts are related to the appreciation of AI feedback, with one focusing on the overall value of the feedback and the other emphasizing the importance of its timeliness during coding activities.  
Criteria: Users value timely AI feedback that enhances code optimization during their coding processes.  
Phrase: Value timely AI feedback.

2.
Concepts: debug ai-generated code, manually corrects ai code errors  
Relationship: Both concepts are interconnected as they describe the proactive actions that users take to identify and fix problems in code produced by AI, highlighting users’ autonomy and responsibility in the debugging process.  
Criteria: Users independently debug and correct errors in AI-generated code outputs.  
Phrase: Debug and correct AI-generated code.

3.
Concepts: acknowledge processing limitations, acknowledges ai limitations with large code  
Relationship: These concepts are related as they address users’ recognition of the inherent limitations of AI systems, particularly when dealing with complex or extensive coding tasks.  
Criteria: Users recognize and discuss the limitations of AI when processing large segments of code.  
Phrase: Acknowledge AI limitations with large code.

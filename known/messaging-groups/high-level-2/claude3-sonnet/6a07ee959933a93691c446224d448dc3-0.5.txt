1. P13: First year of high school
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image 1-198]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 1-202]
9. P14: How do you say it?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, they heat up quickly and save materials. But this is also fine, if you're a bit extravagant, you can cover a fish tank and connect a tube ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Won't the condensed liquid flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid has already been heated during reflux, making it less likely to break
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry things, probably won't be able to touch it before the second half of the year..
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be exactly the same as in the books, although during exams...
20. P1: There isn't any relatively realistic chemistry software at the moment
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was okay
22. Designer: But even the gods of organic chemistry can't solve it
23. Designer: So if you want to do it, you still have to consider it from the exam perspective
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section on electricity will have it, such as charged operations)
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a larger amount of computation...
32. P1: If you have the ability to make a comprehensive and free one, it should be very popular
33. P2: If the CPU is bad, it's game over
34. P11: Adding what you said, it wouldn't be "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
35. P1: It's a series of lab courses
36. P11: Hey, good idea
37. P2: Hehe
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is very annoying?
39. P2: @Designer Can you add a light sensor?
40. Designer: The problem is
41. Designer: Where does the light come from
42. P11: What about the light
43. Designer: Are you using a small bulb to illuminate the photoresistor?
44. P2: Tap with your hand
45. P14: I think there's no problem
46. Designer: Isn't that just a variable resistor, except the curve is different (â€¦â€¦)
47. P2: And a small light
48. Designer: Micro-payment maybe...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 1-245]
52. Designer: We'll see
53. Designer: If you don't have money, you can also click on ads
54. Designer: It's the approach of a conscientious game
55. P1: Put up ads
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: If you tap and release, it won't conduct electricity
58. Designer: Oh
59. Designer: Forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (â€¦â€¦)
60. P11: ðŸ˜‚
61. P11: Just about to say
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but that you don't know how to pay
63. P11: It can also be adapted to 3D touch
64. Designer: Just charge directly through the app store?
65. P14: Feels a bit troublesome
66. P2: â€¦â€¦
67. Designer: Now you can do it with just a fingerprint on the app store
68. P14: After all, just a middle school kid
69. Designer: That's true
70. Designer: Then just click on ads hh
71. P14: That's doable
72. P2: What's wrong with middle school [Emoji 1-268]
73. P2: Even a middle schooler is better than you
74. P11: Just hope the ads don't take up too much of the experiment interface
75. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
76. P11: He means he doesn't have a good payment method in middle school
77. P2: Oh.
78. P2: ï½ž
79. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
80. Designer: Just let you click on ads to earn points, and use points to unlock new content
81. P14: @P2 Maybe you can follow the network cable to hit me
82. P2: I can program
83. P11: Okay!
84. P2: [Emoji 1-280]
85. Designer: Permanent ad banners on iOS are really disgusting
86. P2: Indeed
87. Designer: The screen is not big and has psoriasis.
88. P2: And it forces you to click.
89. P2: What are the ads used for @Designer 
90. Designer: Health preservation...
91. Designer: Doing this requires nurturing people...
92. P1: It's not free.
93. Designer: Actually, it's the same as charging money, except you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay.
94. P2: Oh.
95. Designer: Do a bit more.
96. Designer: There are some other ways.
97. P8: The points wall is okay.
98. P8: @Designer I think it's okay.
99. P14: I also think it's fine.
100. Designer: Actually, you can learn from that mini program.
101. Designer: Creating, reviewing, and doing questions.
102. P14: How do you say it?
103. P14: [Image 1-299]
104. P17: Brain King.
105. P18: By the way, how to use it?
106. P18: Just downloaded.
107. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10

*Summary*

The conversation revolves around discussions related to Physics Lab, an educational software or platform. Participants discuss various aspects such as chemistry experiments, simulations, payment models, advertisements, and potential features like light sensors and touch interactions. The conversation covers a wide range of topics, including technical considerations, user experience, and monetization strategies.

*Plan*

To analyze this conversation from the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Learning Sciences: Examine how the conversation facilitates or hinders learning experiences, knowledge sharing, and collaborative problem-solving related to physics and chemistry concepts.

2. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): Analyze the discussions around user interface design, interaction modalities (e.g., touch, light sensors), and user experience considerations for the Physics Lab platform.

3. Participatory Design: Investigate how the conversation reflects a participatory design process, where users (students, teachers) contribute ideas, feedback, and requirements for the development of Physics Lab.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Thoughts: In this first round of coding, I'll focus on understanding the context and intent behind each message. I'll consider the research question, "How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?" and explore how the designers and users interact with each other. I'll examine the language, tone, and content of each message to identify patterns and themes. Guiding questions include: What is the purpose of each message? How do the designers and users respond to each other? What are the key topics and concerns being discussed?

Phrases for each message:

1. Sharing teaching experience and background;
2. Announcing the upcoming release of Physics Lab 1.0.1;
3. Apologizing for a late-night disturbance;
4. Requesting download instructions;
5. Apologizing for a previous question;
6. Introducing the concept of group sharing;
7. Providing download instructions for Windows;
8. Updating users on the development plan and soliciting feedback;
9. Expressing excitement or enthusiasm;
10. Expressing excitement or playfulness;

Summary: The conversation begins with a user sharing their teaching experience, followed by a designer announcing the upcoming release of Physics Lab 1.0.1. The conversation then shifts to users asking questions about downloading the software, with designers providing instructions and updates on the development plan. The tone is generally positive and collaborative, with users expressing excitement and designers apologizing for any inconvenience.

Notes: From this initial conversation, it appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, providing updates and instructions, and soliciting feedback. The users are curious about the software and eager to learn more. The tone is friendly and collaborative, suggesting that the online community is emerging as a supportive and interactive space. Hypotheses include: the designers' active engagement may contribute to the emergence of the online community, and the users' curiosity and enthusiasm may drive the development of Physics Lab.

        "1271123323 2018/03/24 14:51:14\nTolerance in Exams | Topic | 785 characters\nTolerance is a virtue; tolerance is a state of mind; tolerance brings two hearts closer; tolerance unites the two poles of the earth. Tolerance is like a blooming flower that perfumes the whole spring; tolerance is like a lush tree that cools the whole summer; tolerance is like a blazing maple that ignites the whole autumn; tolerance is like a shocking snow that silences the whole winter. Those who have tolerance are like having a sea, embracing countless rivers; those who have tolerance are like having a sky, accommodating countless birds; those who have tolerance are like having a desert, hugging countless sands. Tolerance is what everyone needs to have, tolerance is the bearing of a gentleman, is the magnanimity of a gentleman. During the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu performed the \"Three Qi\" story. They agreed that whoever captured Nanjiang first would own it, but Zhuge Liang seized the opportunity to capture Nanjiang while Zhou Yu was preoccupied with thinking about how to attack the city, which was the first Qi. The second Qi was the famous: Zhou Lang's brilliant plan pacified the world, and he lost his wife and his army. He originally planned to use the beauty strategy to keep Liu Bei, but was discovered by Zhuge Liang, who used a strategy to bring Liu Bei and his wife back, and then mocked Zhou Lang loudly on the ship. The third Qi was because Zhou Lang used \"borrowing the road to destroy Guo,\" he wanted to take Jingzhou, but pretended to take Hanzhong first, hoping to catch Liu Bei by surprise, but was finally discovered by Zhuge Liang. In the end, because his plans were repeatedly exposed by Zhuge Liang, he fell seriously ill and died soon after, shouting to the heavens before he died: \"Why was Yu born before Liang?\" Zhou Yu was eventually killed by anger. He was talented in both literature and martial arts from a young age, but lacked a certain breadth and stature. In this world, since no two leaves are the same, there are even fewer identical people. Everyone has their own personality, pursuits, habits, and strengths. Everyone has their own way of life, way of doing things, and thinking habits. Therefore, it is normal for there to be some disagreements between people. As long as we have a tolerant heart, we can understand, respect, and forgive others, and we can gain happiness, enjoyment, and comfort. Tolerance is a high mountain that can accommodate flowers and thorns; it can accommodate towering trees and a slender little grass; tolerance is a gentle spring rain that can melt solid ice layers and awaken sleeping love; tolerance is a gentle autumn wind that can scatter dark clouds and call back lost conscience. Tolerance is nurturing, understanding, and caring; tolerance is giving, dedicating, and a new moon crescent, a piece of colorful clouds."

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

Label: prioritizing development areas
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

9.
Label: promoting efficiency
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

Label: humanizing the designer
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

11.
Label: considering user experience in different modes
Quotes:

Label: ensures participatory design
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

18.
Label: seeking community input
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
- User: This idea is really good

Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

25.
Label: design suggestion
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

26.
Label: expressing satisfaction with software
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

27.
Label: offering alternative
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout
- User: Win7 should be fine.

28.
Label: contributes to development discussion
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

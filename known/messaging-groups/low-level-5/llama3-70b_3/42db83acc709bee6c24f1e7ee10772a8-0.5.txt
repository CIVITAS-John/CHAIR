You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 requests upload assistance; expresses frustration with avatar limitations; seeks technical support
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: user 4229 inquires about platform availability; shows interest in accessibility; wonders about compatibility
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 takes action on upload request; asks about user's profession; shows curiosity about user's background
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: user 4229 self identifies as a teacher; reveals potential use case; implies interest in educational applications
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: 
In this conversation, I plan to analyze the emergence of the online community of Physics Lab through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will focus on how designers and users interact, share knowledge, and negotiate the development of the platform. Guiding questions include: How do designers respond to user requests and feedback? How do users engage with the platform and its development process? What are the power dynamics between designers and users in this online community?

Summary:
The conversation starts with designers sharing content and seeking technical assistance. Users engage with the platform, asking about availability and features, and designers respond by providing resources and inviting feedback. The conversation evolves into a discussion about development priorities, with users making specific requests and designers managing expectations. Throughout the conversation, designers and users show appreciation for each other's efforts and contributions.

Notes:
The conversation suggests that the online community of Physics Lab is emerging as a collaborative space where designers and users interact, share knowledge, and negotiate the development of the platform. Designers seem to be open to user feedback and willing to prioritize features based on user input. Users, on the other hand, are actively engaging with the platform, asking questions, and making requests. The power dynamics between designers and users appear to be relatively balanced, with both parties showing appreciation for each other's contributions.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes.
Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: personalized support
Quotes:
- Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

2.
Label: innovation
Quotes:
- For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

3.
Label: interdisciplinary learning
Quotes:
- Can you also include mechanics experiments?

4.
Label: goal setting
Quotes:
- Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

5.
Label: seamless interaction
Quotes:
- With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

6.
Label: incremental development
Quotes:
- Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

7.
Label: contemplation
Quotes:
- Hmm.

8.
Label: pause
Quotes:
- Hmm.

9.
Label: curriculum design
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

10.
Label: validation
Quotes:
- Indeed

11.
Label: future possibilities
Quotes:
- I myself have some interest in chemistry

12.
Label: future planning
Quotes:
- We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

13.
Label: opportunity identification
Quotes:
- We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

14.
Label: simulation based assessment
Quotes:
- For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

15.
Label: functionality design
Quotes:

16.
Label: idea validation
Quotes:
- This idea is really good

17.
Label: decision making
Quotes:
- When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
- Uh... left side or right side
- Left side

18.
Label: teacher consultation
Quotes:
- Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

20.
Label: notation discussion
Quotes:
- Uh... left side or right side
- [Image] This one, right?

21.
Label: notation style
Quotes:
- Yes, the common one is still the old style

22.
Label: community knowledge
Quotes:

23.
Label: design development
Quotes:
- We are working on this part

24.
Label: notation preference
Quotes:
- But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
- Left side

25.
Label: notation best practice
Quotes:
- But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

26.
Label: community expertise
Quotes:
- But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

27.
Label: design flexibility
Quotes:
- Although you can manually adjust the layout
- So, use both?

28.
Label: design limitations
Quotes:
- This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

29.
Label: release details
Quotes:
- There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

30.
Label: design scope
Quotes:
- The update is quite large...

31.
Label: design optimization
Quotes:
- Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

32.
Label: layout customization
Quotes:
- Although you can manually adjust the layout

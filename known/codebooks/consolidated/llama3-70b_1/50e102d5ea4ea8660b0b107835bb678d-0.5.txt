You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

2.
Label: identifies practical use case
Quotes:

3.
Label: cautions against comprehensiveness
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

4.
Label: fosters a positive and appreciative atmosphere

20.
Label: express gratitude
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

21.

23.
Label: explaining user control options
Quotes:
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

24.
Label: reiterating feature explanation
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation revolves around the development and feedback of a software tool designed for educational purposes in physics. Participants include designers and potential users who discuss updates, request features, and provide feedback.
1. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
2. Designer: Hmm.
3. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
4. P4232: Indeed
5. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
6. Designer: I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
7. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
8. P4232: This is a really good idea
9. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
10. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

11. Designer: [Image]This one.

Thoughts: The conversation appears to be a collaborative discussion between a software designer and users (teachers and students) about the development of an educational tool for physics. The focus is on gathering feedback, discussing potential features, and aligning the software's development with the needs of its users. The tags should reflect the interactive and developmental nature of the conversation.

Messages:
1. Feedback, feature refinement
2. Acknowledgment|Skipped
3. Feature explanation, subject limitation
4. Agreement
5. Personal interest
6. Future feature consideration
7. Feature planning, detailed explanation
8. Positive feedback
9. Collaboration, feedback solicitation
10. Specific question, user engagement
11. Clarification, visual aid

Summary: The conversation is centered around the development of a physics educational software, with the designer actively engaging with users to refine features, explain limitations, and plan future updates. The interaction includes soliciting feedback, discussing subject-specific content, and considering user needs in the design process.

Notes: The conversation highlights a dynamic interaction between the designer and the users, focusing on the practical application and user-centric development of the educational tool. The designer's openness to feedback and proactive engagement in discussing potential features suggest a collaborative approach to software development. The use of visual aids and specific questions indicates an effort to ensure clarity and relevance in the development process.

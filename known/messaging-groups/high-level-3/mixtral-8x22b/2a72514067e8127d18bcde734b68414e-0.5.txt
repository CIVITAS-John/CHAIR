You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

* Summary
The conversation revolves around the development and features of Physics Lab, an online community for physics experiments. Users request specific features, such as demonstrations of mechanical waves and optical experiments, while designers discuss the development priorities. A user inquires about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version, and the designer mentions an upcoming update that will improve the power supply components.

* Plan
The conversation will be analyzed from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Themes will include user engagement, collaborative design, and the integration of technology in learning. Quotes will be used to support each theme and phrase.

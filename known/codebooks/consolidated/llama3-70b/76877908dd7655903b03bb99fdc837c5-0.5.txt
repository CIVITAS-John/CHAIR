You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

~~~
1.
Concepts: classroom application discussion, classroom implementation challenges
- User or designer discusses using Physics Lab in a classroom or educational setting.
- Users discuss challenges related to implementing Physics Lab in classrooms.

2.
Concepts: mutual support, support provision
- Users and designers exchange support and gratitude, or offer/request assistance.
- Designer provides resources or specific help to users, offering ongoing support or assistance, and encourages users to seek help and support.

3.
Concepts: usability discussion, future update planning and discussion
- The designer or user discusses usability issues or ways to improve the software's user experience.
- Designer or users discuss or plan future updates or improvements.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: classroom application discussion, classroom implementation challenges
Relationship: Intersection (both concepts relate to the application of Physics Lab in classrooms)
Criteria: Discussions or mentions of using Physics Lab in educational settings, and/or challenges faced while implementing it in classrooms.
Label: Classroom Integration Challenges

2.
Concepts: mutual support, support provision
Relationship: Inclusion (support provision is a type of mutual support)
Criteria: Instances of users and designers exchanging support, offering assistance, or providing resources to help each other.
Label: Community Support

3.
Concepts: usability discussion, future update planning and discussion
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts relate to improving the software, but focus on different aspects)
Criteria: Discussions or mentions of improving the user experience, and/or planning or discussing future updates to the software.
Label: Software Improvement

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: highlight educational needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

2.
Label: communication about progress and plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

3.
Label: resource utilization
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

4.
Label: discuss input methods
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

5.
Label: feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

6.
Label: user acknowledgment
Quotes:
- User: ok

7.
Label: internet availability inquiry
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

8.
Label: feature improvement
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

9.
Label: ask followup question on user request
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

10.
Label: upload image
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

11.
Label: promise future consultation
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

12.
Label: teaching
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

13.
Label: acknowledge potential inconvenience
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

14.
Label: ask for teachers' help
Quotes:

Label: specifics
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

17.
Label: design/feature suggestion
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

18.
Label: touch screen consideration
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

19.
Label: technical detail
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

20.
Label: build rapport
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

21.
Label: update status inquiry
Quotes:
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?

22.
Label: platform limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

23.
Label: consider hardware limitations
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

24.
Label: designer user interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

25.
Label: open to alternatives
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

26.
Label: design discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

27.
Label: suggest educational enhancements
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

28.
Label: welcome
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

29.
Label: feature optimization
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

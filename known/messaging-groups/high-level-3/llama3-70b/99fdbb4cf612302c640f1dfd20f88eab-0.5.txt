You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of theme 1

1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

Here is a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research on how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

---
* Summary
This conversation is an excerpt from the online community of Physics Lab, where users and designers interact, ask questions, and provide feedback. The conversation revolves around downloading and using the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab, with designers providing updates and support.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do designers and users interact and collaborate in this online community? What role do updates and feedback play in shaping the community's dynamics? How do users' questions and suggestions influence the development of Physics Lab?

# Community Building
## Expressing Gratitude
Definition: Users express appreciation for designers' hard work.
- "Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work." (User-4230)
- (Implicit in User-4231's tone, e.g., "Hello everyone, may I ask...")

## Seeking Help
Definition: Users ask for assistance or guidance on using Physics Lab.
- "Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?" (User-4231)
- "How do you use the PC version?" (User-4232)

# Feedback and Updates
## Providing Information
Definition: Designers share updates, features, or changes to Physics Lab.
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate)." (Designer-1)
- "The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component." (Designer-1)

## Soliciting Feedback
Definition: Designers actively seek suggestions or input from users.
- "Okay. Please give more suggestions!" (Designer-1)

# Technical Support
## Sharing Resources
Definition: Designers or users share resources, such as images or files, to facilitate understanding or troubleshooting.
- "[Image 2-14]" (Designer-1)
- "[Image 2-19]" (User-4232)

## Addressing Technical Issues
Definition: Designers or users discuss technical problems or limitations of Physics Lab.
- "It does not support the XP system." (Designer-2)

This codebook provides a starting point for analyzing the factors that contribute to the emergence of Physics Lab's online community. The themes and phrases can be refined and expanded as the analysis continues.

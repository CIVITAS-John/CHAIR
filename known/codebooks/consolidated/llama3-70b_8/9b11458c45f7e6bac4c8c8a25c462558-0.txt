You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Concepts: debugging ai-generated code, manually debug and correct errors
Relationship: The concepts are related in that participants use AI-generated code as a starting point, but then take a hands-on approach to identify and correct errors, indicating a hybrid approach to debugging.
Criteria: Participants identify and correct errors in AI-generated code through a combination of AI-assisted debugging and manual hands-on debugging.
Phrase: Debugging and correcting AI-generated code manually.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. P4232: I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
2. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available in the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
3. Designer: Sorry for the midnight rooster crowing :)
4. P4233: How can I download it?
5. P4233: Excuse me.
6. P8: Shared in the group.
7. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and energized screwdriver this week. If there are any features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group. We will try our best to consider them. Saving experiments to the cloud/local storage, as mentioned before, is also in the plan. Thank you all!
9. P4234: [Emoji 56]
10. P4232: [Emoji 57][Emoji 57]

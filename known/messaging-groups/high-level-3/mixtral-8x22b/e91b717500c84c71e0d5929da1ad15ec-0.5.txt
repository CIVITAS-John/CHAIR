You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

* Summary
In this conversation, the designers of Physics Lab interact with users, discussing the development plan and gathering feedback. Users request specific features for the platform, and the designers outline their priorities for future development.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the perspective of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we will examine the ways in which the designers and users collaborate to identify and prioritize features for the platform. We will also consider how the platform supports learning and engagement with physics concepts. Guiding questions include: How do the designers and users collaborate to identify and prioritize features for the platform? How does the platform support learning and engagement with physics concepts?

# Collaborative Design
## Gathering User Feedback
Definition: The process of soliciting and incorporating feedback from users into the design and development of a platform.
- "If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up." (Designer-1)
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything." (Designer-1)

## Prioritizing Features
Definition: The process of determining which features to develop first based on user feedback and the designers' goals for the platform.
- "We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts." (Designer-1)
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything." (Designer-1)

# Learning and Engagement
## Requesting Features for Learning
Definition: The act of requesting specific features that will support learning and engagement with a particular subject.
- "Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference?" (User-4230)
- "Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments." (User-4230)

## Providing Access to Resources
Definition: The act of making resources available to users, such as download links or group files.
- "The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement." (Designer-1)
- "I saw the group files, thank you." (User-4231)

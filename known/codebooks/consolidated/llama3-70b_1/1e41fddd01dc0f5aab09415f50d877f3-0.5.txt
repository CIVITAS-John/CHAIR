You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: speculates on cause
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

2.
Label: announces new version
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

3.
Label: considering user experience in different modes
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

4.
Label: designer 1 informs about internal resistance removal
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

5.
Label: introduce feature functoins

- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

6.
Label: expressing confusion
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

7.
Label: personal anecdote
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

8.
Label: designer 1 informs about dc and ac support
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

9.

Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

14.
Label: designer 1 uses emoticon
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

15.
Label: sets boundaries
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

16.
Label: suggest future possibilities
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

17.
Label: providing context about the user's background
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

18.
Label: explain focus areas
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

19.
Label: user 4230 engages in participatory design
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

20.
Label: providing download link
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

21.
Label: acknowledges completion
Quotes:
- User: Updated

22.
Label: seek expert input
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

23.
Label: commit to adding suggested feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

24.
Label: expressing enthusiasm non verbally
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

25.
Label: announces research
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

27.
Label: encourage future discussion or questions
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

28.
Label: prioritization
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

29.

Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

31.
Label: highlighting teacher specific needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

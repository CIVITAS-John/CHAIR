1.
Label: peer programming benefits
Quotes:
- E01: I'm an advocate of peer programming. It's about 10 times more efficient than single programming... If a person's programming, if you're programming it by yourself and you come to something you don't understand, you could spend a long time at that stoplight. (interviewer's observation) E01's positive opinions on peer programming with a hint that AI could play the role.

2.
Label: encounters old functionality in ai responses
Quotes:
- E04: I guess, in their databases, they still have like, NetLogo 5 in there and stuff. So like, for example, you know, the anonymous functions, they still use like, the old, sometimes I'll get like, the old functionality for the anonymous functions. (interviewer's observation) Writing code in older versions of NetLogo

3.
Label: human-ai: no need to blindly follow
Quotes:
- E04: To me, it seems like you need to have a certain degree of expertise to understand where the errors are and how to fix them. Because otherwise it's like you're going down this path where you're blindly following the ChatGPT and you have no idea what's going on. For less experienced people, I wouldn't like that because it could put you in a worse situation. (interviewer's observation) Requires expertise to understand errors and debug them. Risks to blindly follow ChatGPT, esp. for less experienced people.

4.
Label: interviewee noting the current chat gpt implementation cannot check the generated code with external information (partially solved by the interpreter plugin
Quotes:
- E01: And some of them we still haven't been doing like hive mind, like how we are going to have the machine learning back from the user feedback or just from the compiler, right? You generate some code, but it doesn't work. So we have to tell you that this time, you didn't work. (interviewer's observation) The current ChatGPT implementation cannot check the generated code with external information (compiler, etc.) (partially solved by the Interpreter plugin, but only Python at this time)

5.
Label: problem solving approach
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 chooses to fix the problem rather than showing the explanation.

7.
Label: identifying need for context specific documentation
Quotes:
- E01: And you want doctors to use it, nurses to use it and medical transcriptionists to use it. They use a different word for whatever the verb for whatever it is you're saying you want them to do. And so, in some sense, their documentation has to be customized to their context to their user group. ... It's a language system. If you have a learning system that's actually capable of harvesting information, yeah, and a lot of them are not yet, but I think we'll get there. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to translate jargons between different sub-groups working in the same systems and ease the cost of writing customized documentation.

8.
Label: error messages
Quotes:

9.
Label: routine way of using netlogo
Quotes:
- E04: I just like being able to kind of, like, iteratively build it. The thing that I always do when I create a model is I do, like, the initial command. I'll set up and go here. I'll go ahead and after I kind of set up the buttons, I'll put the functions behind them back here in the interface. (interviewer's observation) E04 creates the code skeleton before asking ChatGPT.

10.
Label: demonstrating preference for hands on learning
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 chooses to fix the problem rather than showing the explanation.

11.
Label: misinterpretation
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

12.
Label: cost savings through early detection
Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help.

16.
Label: chatgpt usage: reference
Quotes:

17.
Label: knowledge gaps in documentation
Quotes:

19.
Label: learning from ai
Quotes:
- E01: This is what conversations with ChatGPT typically look like. I had to go through about eight separate times to get all the errors out of it.  But, but look at how it structured the code.

21.
Label: dealing with time constraints for each language
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the, one of the things which I have observed, as I'm bouncing from like, because I do a lot of different languages and potentially, so I don't have that much time to spend in anyone. (interviewer's observation) As an expert, E01 knows many languages but does not have much time for each one.

22.
Label: ai assisted coding
Quotes:
- E01: So if I'm writing long NetLogo code now, I'd probably have ChatGPT just open on the side. And I write a block of code and then I handed ChatGPT. Say, could I have done this better? And it would go, yeah, you could rearrange this like that. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could help E01 optimize his code.
- E01: I want to do this in visual basic... So I made a spreadsheet and I asked ChatGPT, how do you do this? And it wrote the code and the code worked out of the box. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT helped with a VBA task out of the box before.

(interviewer's observation) Critique on the existing situation of technical documentation and imagine that AI could improve the learning process.

27.
Label: critiques current ai limitations
Quotes:
- E01: And some of them we still haven't been doing like hive mind, like how we are going to have the machine learning back from the user feedback or just from the compiler, right? You generate some code, but it doesn't work. So we have to tell you that this time, you didn't work.

- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.

32.
Label: noticing ai's limitations in handling version changes
Quotes:

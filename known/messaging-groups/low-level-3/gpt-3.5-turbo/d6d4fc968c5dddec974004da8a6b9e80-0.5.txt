You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (18 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...

18. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer: I tried it in junior high last time. Now there is a clever way to click on the link button in the upper right corner, pop up the browser, and it won't be full screen anymore... = =
Preliminary tags: user experience sharing; software exploration; usability feedback
2. P4232: @Designer Yes, that's right.
Preliminary tags: affirmation; community agreement; social interaction
3. P4232: It would be convenient to have an export function, or save and import experiments. We can set the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary tags: feature request; experiment management; user needs
4. Designer: It will be available.
Preliminary tags: feature implementation commitment; user feedback integration; iterative design
5. Designer: Is there a network in the classroom?
Preliminary tags: classroom technology; network availability; educational context
6. P4232: Generally not, since one time during a city-level public class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 41].
Preliminary tags: network restrictions; classroom technology challenges; content filtering
7. Designer: 2333333333
8. Designer: Looks like we need to support local export now.
9. P4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid software downloads that may slow down the computers.
10. Designer: Mm-hmm.
11. P4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were all amazed.
12. Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. P4232: I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available on the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
15. Designer: Sorry for the midnight crowing :)
16. P4233: How to download?
17. P4233: May I ask?
18. P8: Group sharing.

Thoughts: In analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, consider perspectives from user experience design, community building, educational technology, and software development. Look at how users interact with the software, share feedback, and request features. Also, explore the dynamics of the online community, social interactions, and the impact of technology in educational settings.

Tags for each message:
1. user experience sharing; software exploration; usability feedback
2. affirmation; community agreement; social interaction
3. feature request; experiment management; user needs
4. feature implementation commitment; user feedback integration; iterative design
5. classroom technology; network availability; educational context
6. network restrictions; classroom technology challenges; content filtering
7. excitement; informal communication
8. feature development; software update
9. network restrictions; classroom technology challenges; software impact on school policies
10. acknowledgment; agreement
11. user feedback; positive user experience; educational impact
12. community engagement; user role exploration
13. user background; teaching experience
14. software update announcement; release information
15. informal apology; community engagement
16. software download inquiry
17. help request
18. community collaboration; group interaction

Summary: The conversation revolves around user experiences, software features, community interactions, and educational implications of Physics Lab. The Designer engages with users, acknowledges feedback, and announces updates. Users provide usability feedback, request features like export functions, and discuss classroom challenges such as network restrictions. The community shows agreement, shares teaching experiences, and expresses enthusiasm for the software's simulation effects.

Notes: The online community around Physics Lab is active and engaged, with users providing valuable feedback and suggestions for improvement. The Designer plays a crucial role in responding to user needs and shaping the software based on community input. The conversation also highlights the importance of considering educational contexts and challenges when designing technology for classroom use.

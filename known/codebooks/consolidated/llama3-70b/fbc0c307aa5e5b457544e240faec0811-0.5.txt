You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

5.
Label: respond to the feature request
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

18.
Label: promise to development an app about chemistry on a later time
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

19.

Label: promise to invite feedback from everyone in the group
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

21.
Label: ask about user needs
Quotes:

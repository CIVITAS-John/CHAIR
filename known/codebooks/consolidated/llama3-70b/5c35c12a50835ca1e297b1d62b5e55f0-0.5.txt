You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes.
Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Label: middle school context
Quotes:
- Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

3.
Label: convenience
Quotes:
- This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

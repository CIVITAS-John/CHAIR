You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: highlighting improvements
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

Label: expanding power supply options
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

6.
Label: inquire about recent updates
Quotes:
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

7.
Label: emphasizing the need for modern machines
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

8.
Label: explaining workaround
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

9.
Label: ensure accuracy
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

10.
Label: gather detailed requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

11.
Label: inquiring about expansion to other physics domains
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

12.
Label: demonstrating design principles
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

13.
Label: propose another feature
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

14.
Label: with regular updates and ongoing refinement based on user feedback
Quotes:

Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

17.
Label: maintaining privacy for specific requests
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

18.
Label: prioritizing development task
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

19.

22.
Label: offers a diagnose for the problem
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

23.
Label: reflection on experiences
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

24.
Label: justifying focus on foundational features
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

25.
Label: offering user control
Quotes:
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

28.
Label: acknowledge limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

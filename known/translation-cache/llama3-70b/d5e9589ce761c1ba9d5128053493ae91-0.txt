1. # 新的特性
电子元件会在一个短暂的过程后损坏，而非立即损坏。清空桌面现在会显示一个确认界面。支持撤销导线、元件的创建和删除。用电器现在显示交变电流的有效值。(PC) 可以通过 Esc 键退出应用了。# 新的元件新增了灵敏电流计。新增了学生电源（交直流理想电源）。# 元件性质的调整干电池现在拥有可调节的内阻，不再是理想电源。白炽灯泡现在拥有伏安特性参数，不再是理想电阻。电阻定律实验器现在采用真实公式计算，参数可调。隐藏了接线板 3 和 4。# BUG 修复修复了Editor属性时单位换算导致的问题。接线柱箭头不再显示跳跃动画。某些电路接法可能存在运算错误的问题。

2. 建议pc版增加一个退出按键功能，现在很多地区都用的是触屏一体机，没有实体键盘
---
3. 嗯嗯。。。下一次更新的时候补上。PC 更新一般是最快的，估计这周末又会有一轮
---
4. 话说这样的话岂不是每个输入数字的地方都应该加个软键盘
---
5. 触屏都有自己的屏幕键盘
---
6. 但没法在不碰input的时候呼出来，大概是这样吧
---
7. 我上次在初中试过，现在有一个比较取巧的办法就是点右上那个链接按钮，弹出浏览器之后就不是全屏了……= =
---
8. @3 是的是的
---
9. 如果能有导出功能，或者是保存实验或导入实验，就方便了，咱可以在办公室把参数弄好了，在班上直接导入就行了
---
10. 会有的
---
11. 班上有网络吗？
---
12. 一般没有，我们这儿自从有一次大市级公开课上课时，蹦出来个成人图片，学校就关闭了班级电脑的网络[Emoji]

Here are the translations:

1. New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately. The desktop clearing function now displays a confirmation interface. Supports undoing, creating, and deleting wires and components. The multimeter now displays the effective value of alternating current. (PC) You can exit the application by pressing the Esc key.

# New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter. Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

# Component Property Adjustments
Dry batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources. Incandescent bulbs now have voltage and current characteristics and are no longer ideal resistors. The resistor law experiment device now uses real formulas for calculation, with adjustable parameters. Hid connectors 3 and 4.

# Bug Fixes
Fixed the issue of unit conversion when editing properties in the Editor. The wire arrow no longer displays a jumping animation. Some circuit connections may have calculation errors.

2. It's recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version, as many regions now use all-in-one touch screens without physical keyboards.
---

---
3. Yeah... I'll make up for it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, and I estimate it'll be ready by this weekend.
---

---
4. If that's the case, shouldn't we add a soft keyboard to every input field?
---

---
5. Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
---

---
6. But it can't be called out without touching the input, probably.
---

---
7. I tried it in middle school, and there's a clever way to do it - just click the link button in the top right corner, and after the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
---

---
8. @3 is right.
---

---
9. If we could have an export function or save experiments and import them, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
---

---
10. It will be available.
---

---
11. Is there internet in the classroom?
---

---
12. Generally not. Since that one time when an adult image popped up during a public lesson, the school shut down the classroom computers' internet access [Emoji].

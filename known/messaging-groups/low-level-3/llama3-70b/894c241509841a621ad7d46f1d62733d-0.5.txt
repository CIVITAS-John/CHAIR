You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. Designer: For the electrical side, I plan to add a simulated experiment assessment function; it will include many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, it will only be useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use regularly)
Preliminary tags: simulated experiment; assessment function; experimental details
2. P4232: This is a really good idea
Preliminary tags: positive feedback; idea validation
3. Designer: When preparing to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary tags: collaborative development; user consultation
4. Designer: Asking the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in textbooks? [Image 91]
Preliminary tags: teacher consultation; circuit diagram notation
5. Designer: [Image 92] This one
Preliminary tags: image sharing; circuit diagram example
6. P4234: Yes, the common one or the old-fashioned one.
Preliminary tags: notation confirmation; common notation
7. Designer: Um... left or right?
8. Designer: We are working on this.
9. P4234: Left side.
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Keep it simple...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side without crossing.
13. Designer: So, should we use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, which may produce some weird results.
15. Designer: [Image 102]
16. Designer: Thank you for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 104]
18. Designer: There will be an update. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version next weekend.
19. Designer: The update is quite substantial...

Thoughts: In this conversation, I plan to analyze the emergence of Physics Lab's online community through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will explore how the designer engages with the community, solicits feedback, and incorporates user input into the development process. I will also examine the role of visual aids, such as images, in facilitating communication and collaboration.

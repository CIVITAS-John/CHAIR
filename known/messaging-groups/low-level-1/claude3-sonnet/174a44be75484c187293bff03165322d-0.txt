Summary of the conversation until now: This conversation involves members of an online physics community discussing various physics-related topics, sharing resources (images/multimedia), asking and answering questions, expressing opinions and reactions, and engaging in casual conversation. There are instances of providing information, clarifying concepts, speculating, agreeing/disagreeing, advising, and expressing humor.
1. P14: I can't remember if it's 78 or 79.
2. P14: [Image]
3. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
4. P11: Look it up online, this is not something that can be solved in a few words. @P2 
5. P2: Can we add a motor? @Designer 
6. P14: I think I should focus on doing mathematics.
7. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
8. Designer: We will be relatively simple, practical (close to the exam), and affordable.
9. P11: 2333
10. P11: Ask the group owner.
11. Designer: After all, it's not specifically about astronomy.
12. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
13. P2: [Image]
14. P2: From what I know currently.
15. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in the Physics Lab?
16. Designer: Motor simulation is more complicated, and it depends on the load.
17. Designer: Calculated it...
18. P2: How was it calculated?
19. P11: Okay.
20. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
21. P11: [Image]
22. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but an atomized model.
23. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
24. P1: Server?
25. P11: Hahaha
26. Designer: Standalone.
27. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
28. Designer: Two types of motors.
29. P1: Are you going to the server?
30. P2: Brushed motor.

Summary: The conversation involves members of an online physics community discussing various topics related to physics simulations, models, and experiments. They share resources (images/multimedia), ask and answer questions, propose ideas, clarify concepts, and engage in casual conversation. There are instances of seeking and providing information, expressing opinions and reactions, referring to authorities or past events, considering practical limitations, and distinguishing between different approaches or types of models/equipment. The conversation also touches on technical aspects of physics, such as motors, power sources, and calculations.

Notes: The conversation demonstrates the emergence of an online community where members collaborate, share knowledge, and engage in discussions related to their shared interest in physics. There are instances of seeking and providing information, proposing ideas, and clarifying concepts, which suggest a supportive environment for learning and problem-solving. The casual tone and occasional humor also indicate a sense of camaraderie and familiarity among the members. However, some contributions are unclear or lack context, which may hinder effective communication or understanding within the community.

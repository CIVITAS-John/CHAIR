You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

25.
Label: acknowledge limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

26.
Label: highlighting user interface challenges
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: prioritizing development areas, prioritizing release and tasks
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both involve designers making decisions about what to focus on, with "prioritizing development areas" being a more general concept and "prioritizing release and tasks" being a more specific one.
Criteria: Designers determine what to focus on in terms of development and release.
Phrase: Prioritizing development and release.

2.
Concepts: design implications, considers broader implications
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both involve designers thinking about the potential consequences of their design decisions, with "design implications" being a more specific concept and "considers broader implications" being a more general one.
Criteria: Designers think about the potential consequences of their design decisions.
Phrase: Considering design implications.

3.
Concepts: proposing compromises, providing alternative solutions
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both involve designers offering alternative solutions to a problem, with "proposing compromises" being a more specific concept and "providing alternative solutions" being a more general one.
Criteria: Designers offer alternative solutions to a problem.
Phrase: Proposing alternative solutions.

4.
Concepts: iterates on design, design option consideration
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both involve designers exploring different possibilities for a design, with "iterates on design" being a more specific concept and "design option consideration" being a more general one.
Criteria: Designers explore different design options.
Phrase: Iterating on design options.

5.
Concepts: explores potential solutions, discusses future possibilities
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both involve designers thinking about possibilities for the future, with "explores potential solutions" being a more specific concept and "discusses future possibilities" being a more general one.
Criteria: Designers think about possibilities for the future.
Phrase: Exploring future possibilities.

6.
Concepts: providing access information
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Designers provide access to information or resources.
Phrase: Providing access information.

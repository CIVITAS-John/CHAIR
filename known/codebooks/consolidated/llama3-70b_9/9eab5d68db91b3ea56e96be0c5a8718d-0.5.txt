You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: lists upcoming features including components and support for teaching
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

2.
Label: extends user suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

3.
Label: explaining focus on specific physics domains
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

4.
Label: sharing professional experience
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

5.
Label: a focus on practical
Quotes:

- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
- User: Is there a user manual?
- User: How to download?

8.
Label: establishing authority
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

9.
Label: wonders about compatibility
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

10.
Label: influences design decisions
Quotes:
- User: Left side

11.
Label: suggest practical use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

12.
Label: promoting community involvement in development
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

13.

- Designer: Make it simpler...

14.
Label: soliciting specific needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

15.
Label: request specific features
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

16.
Label: informing users of changes
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

17.
Label: expresses approval and enthusiasm for the proposed idea of simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

18.
Label: advise on development approach
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

19.
Label: seeks clarification on the preferred side for circuit diagram intersections
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- User: Left side

20.
Label: updating users about changes in simulation
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

21.
Label: acknowledges designer 1's input
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

22.
Label: expressing desire for convenience
Quotes:

Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

28.
Label: explaining common school policy

Interviewer:
Hello.

Interviewee:
Hello.

Interviewer:
Thank you for joining us today. Could you please start by telling us a little about yourself?

Interviewee:
Thank you for having me. My name is Sarah Matthews, and I’m a project manager with a background in marketing and over seven years of experience in managing large-scale digital campaigns.

Interviewer:
It’s great to meet you, Sarah. What attracted you to project management in the first place?

Interviewee:
I’ve always been fascinated by the process of bringing ideas to life and ensuring that all the pieces come together to achieve the final goal. Early in my career, I realized that I enjoyed organizing and leading teams to execute complex projects, so I transitioned into project management.

Interviewer:
What would you say is the most rewarding aspect of your work?

Interviewee:
For me, it’s seeing a project come to fruition—knowing that months of planning, collaboration, and hard work have led to a successful launch. The satisfaction of knowing that we’ve delivered something valuable is extremely fulfilling.

Interviewer:
Can you give us an example of a particularly challenging project you’ve worked on?

Interviewee:
Absolutely. Last year, I led a rebranding project for a client that involved coordinating between multiple departments—design, marketing, development, and external partners. The timeline was tight, and we had to deal with unexpected changes midway through the project, but in the end, we delivered on time and within budget.

Interviewer:
How did you handle the unexpected changes during that project?

Interviewee:
I made sure to keep the lines of communication open between all stakeholders. We held regular check-ins to adjust priorities and manage expectations. I also kept the team focused on the larger picture, so we could pivot quickly without losing momentum.

Interviewer:
That’s a great strategy. How do you keep yourself organized when managing such complex projects?

Interviewee:
I rely on a mix of project management tools and time management techniques. Tools like Trello and Asana help me track tasks and milestones, while I personally use time-blocking to ensure I dedicate the right amount of attention to each aspect of the project.

Interviewer:
What advice would you give someone just starting in project management?

Interviewee:
I’d say learn to be flexible and adaptable. Things rarely go exactly as planned, so being able to adjust while staying focused on the end goal is key. Also, strong communication is essential—you need to ensure everyone is on the same page.

Interviewer:
Where do you see yourself in the next few years?

Interviewee:
I’m aiming to take on larger, more strategic projects and eventually move into a senior management position, where I can shape the direction of multiple projects across an organization.

Interviewer:
Thank you, Sarah. It was a pleasure speaking with you today.

Interviewee:
Thank you! It was a great conversation.

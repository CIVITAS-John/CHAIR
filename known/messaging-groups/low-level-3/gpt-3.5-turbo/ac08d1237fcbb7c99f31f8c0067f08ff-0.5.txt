You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (24 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
24. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

9. P10: Hello everyone, I am a new member. Nice to meet you all. Thank you.
10. P11: Seeking advice on a question.
11. P11: [Image 41]
12. P11: This is a rectifier circuit.
13. P11: The verification should be correct.
14. P11: However,
15. P11: [Image 45]
16. P11: The image is not as expected.
17. P11: Not sure if it's a circuit problem or a software bug, seeking advice.
18. P11: [Image 48]
19. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
20. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
21. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits, so I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know, so please enlighten me in the future. Thank you.
22. P4: Has it been updated?
23. P11: It's not ideal...
24. P11: I will consider the impedance.

Summary: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community involves users sharing images of circuits, seeking advice on technical issues, giving feedback on designs, and interacting with each other and the designer. New members introduce themselves, seek guidance on tasks, and discuss technical aspects of circuits. The designer provides feedback and asks clarifying questions to assist users in troubleshooting and learning.

Notes: The community seems supportive, with users willing to help each other and share knowledge. The designer plays an active role in providing technical guidance and feedback. Some users display varying levels of expertise in physics and circuit design, leading to collaborative problem-solving and learning opportunities within the community.

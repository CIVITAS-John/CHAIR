You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1.
Concepts: human-ai collaboration (positive), emphasize human-ai collaboration
Relationship: The concepts are closely related as they both highlight the importance of human-AI collaboration, with the first concept describing the positive interactions and the second concept emphasizing the value of human judgment in this collaboration.
Criteria: Participants value and engage in human-AI collaboration, optimizing code and inferring needs, and emphasizing human judgment and augmentation in AI-assisted work.
Phrase: Valuing human-AI collaboration.

2.
Concepts: engages with ai for error resolution, reflects on ai's explanatory power
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as they both describe the ways in which participants interact with AI, with the first concept focusing on practical error resolution and the second concept highlighting the reflective aspect of understanding AI's explanatory power.
Criteria: Participants engage with AI to resolve errors and reflect on its explanatory power to figure out syntax and error resolution.
Phrase: Engaging with AI for error resolution and reflection.

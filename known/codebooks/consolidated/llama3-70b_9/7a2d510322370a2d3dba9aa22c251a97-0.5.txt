You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

5.
Label: expression of interest
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

6.
Label: acknowledging the previous statement
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.

- Designer: There will be.

8.
Label: demonstrating domain expertise
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

9.
Label: self-solved
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

10.
Label: setting timelines
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

11.
Label: confirm common style
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

12.
Label: situating themselves in educational context
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

13.
Label: consult on educational standards
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

16.
Label: fostering positive developer user relationship
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

17.
Label: providing flexibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

18.
Label: demonstrating expertise
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

19.
Label: suggesting focused, iterative approach
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

20.
Label: weighing design options
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

21.
Label: establishing authority
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

Label: hmm... i'll add it in the next update. pc updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

23.
Label: explaining development complexity
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

24.
Label: reiterating bidirectional conversion functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

25.
Label: identifying potential usability issues
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

26.
Label: addressing user concerns
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.
- Designer: Hmm hmm.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...

1. P4233: Excuse me.
2. P8: Shared in the group.
3. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
4. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and energized screwdriver this week. If there are any features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group. We will try our best to consider them. Saving experiments to the cloud/local storage, as mentioned before, is also in the plan. Thank you all!
5. P4234: [Emoji 56]
6. P4232: [Emoji 57][Emoji 57]
7. P4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer: Hello :)
9. P4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer: [Image 61] Preparing for an update
11. Designer: This one is more complicated, so it will take a bit more time... Hopefully it will be ready for release this week
12. Designer: There will be: multimeter; energized solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem solving and middle school teaching)
13. P4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer: Have you encountered any problems while using it?
15. Designer: We try to design it to be usable without the need for additional instructions, or we will provide some tips when you open it for the first time based on feedback
16. P4235: Mainly for schools to build information technology schools
17. P4235: Need the user manual for this software
18. Designer: Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?
19. P4232: That's great, I hope it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no software that is convenient for drawing circuit diagrams for the circuit part of the exam
20. Designer: Actually, we are researching bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later
22. P4235: You can also include mechanics experiments
23. Designer: For example, after connecting the physical diagram, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics are sorted out; it will take some time
25. P4232: Oh, that's good
26. Designer: I hope to figure out electromagnetics before the end of the year
27. P4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do exercises in the application
29. P4234: It's starting to take shape [Emoji 80]
30. Designer: For example, connecting the physical diagram to see the circuit diagram, or vice versa
31. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer: Hmm.
33. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, based on everyone's needs, we may do some demonstration experiments, but it won't be as open as electricity
34. P4232: Indeed
35. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
36. Designer: If the opportunity arises later, I will consider making one for chemistry as well
37. Designer: For the electrical side, I plan to add a simulated experiment assessment function; it will include many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, it will only be useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use regularly)
38. P4232: This is a really good idea
39. Designer: When preparing to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
40. Designer: Asking the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in textbooks? [Image 91]
41. Designer: [Image 92] This one
42. P4234: Yes, the common one or the old-fashioned one.

Here is the codebook to analyze the factors that could contribute to the emergence of Physics Lab's online community:

## Community Engagement
Definition: Instances where members of the online group actively participate, interact, and engage with each other.
- "Hello everyone" (P4235)
- "That's great, I hope it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers." (P4232)
- "It's starting to take shape [Emoji 80]" (P4234)

## Feature Requests and Feedback
Definition: Instances where members provide suggestions, feedback, or requests for features to be included in the software.
- "Need the user manual for this software" (P4235)
- "You can also include mechanics experiments" (P4235)
- "Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one" (P4232)

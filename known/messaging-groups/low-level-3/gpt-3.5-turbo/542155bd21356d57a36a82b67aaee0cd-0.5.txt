You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer: Done.
Preliminary tags: completion of task; task related communication
2. P5: Good ðŸ˜‚
Preliminary tags: positive feedback; social interaction
3. P8: @Designer  we need an admin here.
Preliminary tags: mention of designer; request for assistance
4. P13: Are all the members in this group top students?
Preliminary tags: inquiry about group members; community dynamics
5. P14: Except me.
Preliminary tags: self deprecating humor; social interaction
6. P13: ï¼‹1
Preliminary tags: agreement with previous comment; social interaction
7. P15: Plus one more.
8. P16: ï¼‹1
9. P10: May I ask what does "+1" mean?
10. P11: It means "me too".

Thoughts: It seems like the conversation is centered around social interactions, group dynamics, and the role of the designer in the online community. Exploring the emergence of the community through these interactions and mentions of the designer could provide valuable insights into the community's development process.

Tags for each message:
1. task completion; task-related communication; designer involvement
2. positive feedback; social interaction; humor
3. mention of designer; request for assistance; community management
4. inquiry about group members; community dynamics; group composition
5. self-deprecating humor; social interaction; group dynamics
6. agreement with previous comment; social interaction; group dynamics
7. group dynamics; social interaction; community engagement
8. agreement with previous comment; social interaction; community engagement
9. inquiry about online communication; seeking clarification; community norms
10. explanation of online communication; community norms; knowledge sharing

Summary: The conversation revolves around social interactions, group dynamics, and the role of the designer in the online community. Members engage in positive interactions, seek clarification on community norms, and discuss the composition of the group. The emergence of Physics Lab's online community can be traced through these interactions and mentions of the designer.

Notes: It's interesting to see how social interactions and group dynamics play a significant role in shaping the online community. The designer's involvement and members' engagement contribute to the community's development. Further exploration of these themes could provide deeper insights into the community's evolution.

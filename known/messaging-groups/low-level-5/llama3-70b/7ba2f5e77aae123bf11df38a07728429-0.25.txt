You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (5 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
5. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on understanding the interactions between designers and users, exploring how they negotiate meanings and establish relationships. I'll consider the context of online community emergence, examining how participants' intentions and actions shape the community's development. Guiding questions include: How do designers and users interact? What are their goals and concerns? How do they establish trust and reciprocity?

Interpretation phrases for each item:
1. Displaying; showcasing; introducing;
2. Requesting; seeking; clarifying; 
3. Inquiring; asking; seeking clarification;
4. Responding; accommodating; offering; 
5. Confirming; identifying; disclosing;

Summary: The conversation begins with Designer-2 sharing an image, followed by Designer-1 seeking help with uploading a high-definition avatar. User-4229 asks about a PC version, and Designer-1 responds by offering to upload a new version and inquiring about User-4229's profession. The conversation is characterized by a sense of collaboration and mutual interest, with participants exchanging information and assistance.

Notes: It appears that designers are actively engaging with users, addressing their concerns, and seeking feedback. The conversation is informal and friendly, suggesting a sense of community and shared purpose. I hypothesize that designers' openness to user input and feedback may be crucial in establishing trust and fostering a sense of ownership among users.

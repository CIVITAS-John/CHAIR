You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: xp system limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

2.
Label: dry battery removal
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

3.
Label: student focused design
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

4.
Label: software constraints
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

5.
Label: win7 confirmation
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

6.
Label: convenience
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

7.
Label: virtual machine installation
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

8.
Label: technical workaround
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

9.
Label: machine requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

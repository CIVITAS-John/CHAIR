You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: explain dependencies
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

2.
Label: inquiring user input for future iterations
Quotes:
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

3.
Label: inform about changes
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

4.
Label: designer 1 outlines development priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

5.
Label: requested help
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

6.
Label: highlighted school context
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

7.
Label: set expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: The update is quite large...

8.
Label: progress update
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.
- Designer: The update is quite large...
- Designer: We are working on this part
- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

9.
Label: consulting community
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

10.
Label: inform about changes in component behavior
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

11.
Label: designer 2 confirms compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

12.
Label: explained project timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

13.
Label: self-introduction
Quotes:
- User: Hello everyone

14.
Label: acknowledge user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

15.
Label: communicated specific release information
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

16.
Label: pay respect to experts
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

17.
Label: designer 1 offers to provide content
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

18.
Label: designer 1 informs about new version
Quotes:
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group

19.
Label: communicated procedural details
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

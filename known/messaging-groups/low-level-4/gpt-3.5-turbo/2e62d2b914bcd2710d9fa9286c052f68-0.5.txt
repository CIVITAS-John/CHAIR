You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (18 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
18. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: Thank you.
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 expresses gratitude
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary phrases: designer 2 encourages users to directly mention any problems they encounter
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 praises the practicality of the software compared to others
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 suggests looking into xp compatibility and using a virtual machine if needed
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 mentions the theoretical compatibility of the software with older machines
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 announces the release of version 1.01 in the group files
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

Thoughts: In this round of coding, we see users expressing gratitude, praising the software's practicality, and providing feedback on features they find useful or lacking. Designers are actively engaging with user feedback, announcing updates, discussing compatibility issues, and planning future improvements. There is a focus on enhancing user experience, addressing technical issues, and considering the diverse hardware environments users might have. The conversation also touches on the challenges of using the software in educational settings with limited internet access.

Interpretations for each message:
1. User 4232 expresses gratitude.
2. Designer 2 encourages users to directly mention any problems they encounter.
3. User 4232 praises the practicality of the software compared to others.
4. Designer 1 suggests looking into XP compatibility and using a virtual machine if needed.
5. Designer 1 mentions the theoretical compatibility of the software with older machines.
6. Designer 1 announces the release of version 1.01 in the group files.
7. Designer 1 details the updates, new features, adjustments to component properties, and bug fixes in version 1.01.
8. User 4232 recommends adding an exit button function to the PC version for touch screen machines.

18. User 4232 explains the school's decision to disable the network on classroom computers due to a past incident.

Summary: The conversation captures a cycle of user feedback, designer responsiveness, and software updates within the Physics Lab online community. Users express appreciation, provide suggestions for improvements, and share their experiences using the software in different contexts. Designers actively engage with user input, announce new releases, address compatibility concerns, and consider the practical implications of software features in educational settings.

Notes: The iterative nature of feedback and updates in the online community reflects a collaborative approach to software development, where user needs and experiences drive design decisions. The discussion also highlights the importance of considering diverse user environments, such as touch screen devices and limited internet access in educational settings, to ensure the software's usability and effectiveness.

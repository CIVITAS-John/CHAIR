You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (9 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

4.
Concepts: praise ai's debugging capabilities, highlight human-ai collaboration
- Participants praise AI's troubleshooting and debugging capabilities.
- Participants highlight the debugging capabilities of the AI-driven interface and human-AI collaboration in troubleshooting.

5.
Concepts: error reasoning, interpret ai responses
- Reasons through AI-generated responses to identify errors.
- Participants interpret AI mistakes and responses to understand their meaning.

6.
Concepts: imagines ai as a pair programmer, view ai as a peer programmer
- Participants imagine AI as a pair programmer.
- Participants view AI as a peer programmer that can assist and question their motives.

7.
Concepts: integrates ai into workflow, adapt and integrate ai-generated code
- Participants iteratively build models using AI assistance, integrating the AI into their established workflow.
- Participants adapt and integrate AI-generated code into their models.

8.
Concepts: seeking ai help, requesting ai assistance
- Participants describe situations where users seek help or support from others or AI in NetLogo learning and practice, and ask AI for help with plotting model output in NetLogo learning and practice.
- Participants initiate a task or request assistance from the AI to accomplish a specific goal in NetLogo, and request assistance from the AI to create a specific model or structure in NetLogo.

9.
Concepts: effort, takes time to use and adapt
- Mentions the effort or time required to learn and navigate the AI-driven interface or NetLogo.
- Describing the time and effort required to use and adapt to LLM-driven interfaces, including their intuitiveness and ease of use.

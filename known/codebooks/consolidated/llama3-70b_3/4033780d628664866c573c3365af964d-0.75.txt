You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (13 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: future design plans/considerations
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

2.
Label: no elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
- Designer: Group sharing.
- User: Left side

4.
Label: share visual update
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

5.
Label: give an intro to the update content
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

9.
Label: implicit rejection
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

10.
Label: further suggestion
Quotes:

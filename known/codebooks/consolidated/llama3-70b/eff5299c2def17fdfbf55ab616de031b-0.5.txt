You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: expressing uncertainty
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

2.
Label: promoting intuitive design

Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

5.
Label: leaving room for exploration
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

6.
Label: emphasizing value addition
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

7.
Label: appreciating craftsmanship

- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

8.
Label: praising 3d effect
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

10.
Label: let's pay homage to the experts
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

11.
Label: clarifying understanding
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

12.
Label: providing tutorial information
Quotes:
- Designer: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

13.
Label: preparing users for changes
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

14.
Label: providing project updates
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: We are working on this part

15.
Label: educating users about platform features
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

16.
Label: detailing functionalities
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

17.
Label: showing interest in pc version
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

18.
Label: setting boundaries
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

19.
Label: highlighting regional usability concerns
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

20.
Label: providing access
Quotes:
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

21.
Label: theorizing about system compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

22.
Label: inquiring about pc version availability
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

23.
Label: confirming technical specifications
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

24.
Label: validating common practice
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

- Designer: Hmm hmm.

27.
Label: hmm... we will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

28.
Label: building trust
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
- Designer: There will be.

29.
Label: seeking teacher input
Quotes:

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer: I tried it in junior high last time, now there's a clever way to do it, just click the link button on the top right, after the browser pops up, it won't be in full screen anymore... = =
Preliminary tags: user experience; usability; user interface
2. P4232: @Designer Yes, that's right.
Preliminary tags: user feedback; community agreement; user engagement
3. P4232: If there could be an export function, or save and import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set the parameters in the office and import them directly in class.
Preliminary tags: user suggestions; feature request; participatory design
4. Designer: It will be available.
Preliminary tags: feature development; user feedback; community engagement
5. Designer: Is there a network in the classroom?
Preliminary tags: technical constraints; classroom environment; network accessibility
6. P4232: Generally not, since one time during a city-level open class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 41].
Preliminary tags: technical challenges; network restrictions; classroom environment
7. Designer: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer: Looks like we need to support local export now.
9. P4232: Most schools will shut down the network of classroom computers to prevent students from going online, or to prevent various software downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer: Mm-hmm.
11. P4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were all amazed.
12. Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. P4232: I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available in the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
15. Designer: Sorry for the midnight rooster crowing :)
16. P4233: How can I download it?
17. P4233: Excuse me.
18. P8: Shared in the group.

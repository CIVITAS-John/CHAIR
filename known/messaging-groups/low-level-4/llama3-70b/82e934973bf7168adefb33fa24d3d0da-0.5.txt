You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (5 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
5. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

Thoughts: In this initial coding phase, I'll focus on understanding the context and intentions behind each message. I'll consider the language, tone, and potential relationships between participants. I'll also keep in mind the research question, exploring how the online community emerged, and look for hints of participatory design, human-computer interaction, and learning sciences principles.

Interpretations for each message:
1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]; Sharing a visual element; Setting the tone for the conversation;
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?; Seeking technical assistance; Frustration with current avatar limitations;
3. User-4229: PC version?; Inquiring about platform compatibility; Potential interest in accessibility;
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?; Offering assistance; Showing interest in user's profession;
5. User-4229: Yes.; Confirming profession; Establishing credibility;

Summary: The conversation starts with an image shared by Designer-2, followed by Designer-1 seeking help with uploading a high-definition avatar. User-4229 joins the conversation, inquiring about PC version compatibility, and the conversation shifts to Designer-1 offering assistance and showing interest in User-4229's profession as a teacher.

Notes: It's interesting to see the designers taking an active role in the conversation, seeking help and offering assistance. This might indicate a sense of community and collaboration from the early stages. The mention of a teacher's profession could imply that the community is interested in educational applications. I'll keep an eye out for further mentions of educational contexts and participatory design principles.

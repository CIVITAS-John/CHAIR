You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: user inquiry, help and clarification requests
- Users ask questions or seek information about the software or its availability.
- Users seek assistance or clarification on using a feature or function.

2.
Concepts: resource sharing, information sharing
- Designers provide resources or updates to the community.
- Users and designers share information, resources, or expertise to solve problems or answer questions.

3.
Concepts: soliciting feedback, feedback integration
- Designers actively seek feedback or suggestions from users.
- Designers express the intention to gather and incorporate user feedback into the development process.

4.
Concepts: collaboration and feedback
- Users and designers work together to shape the development of the tool.
- Users engage in active learning by providing feedback, which shapes Physics Lab's development and receives support.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: user inquiry, help and clarification requests
Relationship: Inclusion (user inquiry is a type of help and clarification request)
Criteria: Users ask questions or seek information about the software or its availability, or seek assistance or clarification on using a feature or function.
Label: Seeking Assistance

2.
Concepts: resource sharing, information sharing
Relationship: Parallel (resource sharing and information sharing are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Designers provide resources or updates to the community, or users and designers share information, resources, or expertise to solve problems or answer questions.
Label: Knowledge Exchange

3.
Concepts: soliciting feedback, feedback integration
Relationship: Inclusion (feedback integration is a result of soliciting feedback)
Criteria: Designers actively seek feedback or suggestions from users, and express the intention to gather and incorporate user feedback into the development process.
Label: Feedback Solicitation

4.
Concepts: collaboration and feedback
Relationship: Intersection (collaboration involves feedback, and feedback is a key aspect of collaboration)
Criteria: Users and designers work together to shape the development of the tool, and users engage in active learning by providing feedback, which shapes Physics Lab's development and receives support.
Label: Collaborative Development

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging? 
Yes, some categories like "engagement strategies" and "learning approaches" could be further merged into a broader category like "Teaching and Learning".

- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
The category "Design Approaches" might be too broad and could be split into more specific categories like "Participatory Design" and "User-Centered Design".

- Is any naming inaccurate?
The category "Digital Literacy" might be too broad and could be renamed to "Resource Management" to better reflect its content.

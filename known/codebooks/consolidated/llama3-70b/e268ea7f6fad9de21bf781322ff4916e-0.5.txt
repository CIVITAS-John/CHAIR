You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes.
Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: explain development process
Quotes:
- Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

2.
Label: acknowledgement
Quotes:
- First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

Label: acceptance of request

- There will be.

4.
Label: design question
Quotes:
- Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

5.
Label: design discussion
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

7.
Label: sharing information for design
Quotes:
- Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

8.
Label: question about the request
Quotes:
- Does the class have internet?

9.
Label: confirmation
Quotes:
- @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.
- Hmm hmm.
- ðŸ˜‚

10.
Label: proposing design idea
Quotes:
- It seems that local export needs to be supported.

11.
Label: follow-up on design information
Quotes:
- Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

12.
Label: sharing classroom experiences
Quotes:
- The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

13.
Label: sharing identity per request
Quotes:
- I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

14.
Label: apologize for potential interruption
Quotes:
- Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

15.
Label: uncertainty
Quotes:
- Excuse me.

16.
Label: announcement of plans
Quotes:
- We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

Quotes:
- Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
- Are there any other updates recently?

22.
Label: answer about progress
Quotes:
- [Image] Updates in preparation

23.
Label: communication about progress and plans
Quotes:
- Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

24.
Label: difficulty in development
Quotes:
- This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

25.
Label: explanation of upcoming features
Quotes:
- There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

26.
Label: need for usage support
Quotes:
- Is there a user manual?

27.
Label: trying to understand the needs
Quotes:
- What problems did you encounter during use?

28.
Label: explaining design goals
Quotes:
- We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

29.
Label: open to alternatives
Quotes:
- We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

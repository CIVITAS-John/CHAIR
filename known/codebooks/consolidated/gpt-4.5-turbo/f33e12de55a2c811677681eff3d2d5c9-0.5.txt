You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

1. design suggestions, user-initiated improvement suggestions.
- Suggestions from users or discussions that could influence future design decisions.
- Instances where users propose new functionalities or improvements to existing features.

2. feedback responsiveness, responsive design changes.
- Instances where designers seek out and respond to user feedback to refine software features.
- Changes made to the software based on user feedback, reflecting a responsive and adaptive design process.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in the Physics Lab online community ranges from information-seeking behaviors to discussions on astronomy, software, and elements. Members engage through sharing images, expressing agreement, confusion, and appreciation, while also hinting at the emergence of subtopics within the community discussions.
1. P11: 23333
Preliminary tags: emotive expression
2. P2: I'm talking about the software.
Preliminary tags: shifting the topic to software discussion
3. P11: Then ask the group owner.
Preliminary tags: suggestion to direct inquiries to a specific individual
4. Designer: Mars is outside the Earth.
5. Designer: What's the problem?
6. P4: No problem.
7. P2: What about the moon?
8. P1: The moon is not drawn, right?
9. P14: Maybe it hasn't been done yet.
10. Designer: Last time it was too rushed.
11. P4: The moon is useless.
12. P4: 2333
13. Designer: It depends on the scale.
14. P2: Who said that?
15. P4: universe sandbox
16. Designer: There will be multiple presets.
17. Designer: Because in reality, you encounter many possible questions, many of which are about near-Earth space stations.
18. P11: Yes.
19. Designer: Artificial satellite orbits.
20. Designer: These will involve more.
21. Designer: Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter this normally...
22. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
23. P1: John, have you become more Android?
24. Designer: No, I'll update it today.
25. P17: [Image 126]
26. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
27. Designer: I'll buy a ticket to space.
28. P17: It's the starry sky.
29. P1: Don't imitate it exactly the same.
30. P14: There are also software imitating celestial bodies on Steam.
31. P14: I can't remember if it's 78 or 79.
32. P14: [Image 133]
33. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
34. P11: Look it up online, this is not something that can be solved in a few words. @P2 
35. P2: Can we add a motor? @Designer

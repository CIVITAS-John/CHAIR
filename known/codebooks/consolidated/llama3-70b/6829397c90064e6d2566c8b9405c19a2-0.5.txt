You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

2.
Label: community context
Quotes:
- Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

3.
Label: technological affordances
Quotes:
- For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa

4.
Label: development timeline
Quotes:
- There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

- Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

5.
Label: scope and focus
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. P4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

* Summary
The conversation revolves around a request for dynamic demonstrations of various physics concepts, prioritizing certain sections of the lab, seeking download links, and discussing updates to components within the lab.

* Plan
From a learning sciences perspective, it would be interesting to analyze how the community collaborates to enhance learning through dynamic demonstrations. Human-computer interaction can shed light on how users interact with the lab's interface and seek resources. Participatory design can help in understanding how users' input shapes the development of the lab.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

5.
Label: suggested expansion
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

6.
Label: explain design philosophy
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

7.
Label: clarify preference

- User: Left side

8.
Label: explored potential solution
Quotes:

14.
Label: detailed educational needs
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

15.
Label: set scope for experiments
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

16.
Label: detail simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

17.
Label: directs user to message privately for manual needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

18.
Label: updating users on development progress
Quotes:

Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

20.
Label: user 4232 explains common school policy
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

21.
Label: informing about the upcoming software update and its status in the apple market
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

Label: efficiently using community resources
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

23.
Label: consider hardware limitations
Quotes:

24.
Label: reiterating the bidirectional conversion concept
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

25.
Label: introduce new component
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

26.
Label: shared visual reference
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

27.
Label: user 4232 acknowledges designer's input
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

28.
Label: explaning the plans
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

29.
Label: introducing new design elements
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

30.
Label: community need
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

31.
Label: provided constructive feedback
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* collaborative platform design
* community interaction
* design principles
* engagement strategies
* evaluation metrics
* information seeking
* knowledge sharing
* knowledge utilization
* learning processes and validation
* online community development
* platform management
* support for learning
* technology in community building

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (8 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: clarifying system requirements, clarifying platform requirements
Relationship: Both concepts involve clarifying or explaining requirements or limitations, which highlights a shared purpose of providing understanding.
Criteria: Someone explains the requirements or limitations of a system or platform.
Phrase: Clarifying system and platform requirements.

2.
Concepts: informing about system compatibility, system compatibility information
Relationship: These concepts are closely related, as informing about system compatibility is a type of providing information about it.
Criteria: Someone provides information about system compatibility.
Phrase: Informing about system compatibility.

3.
Concepts: suggesting system compatibility, suggesting checking compatibility of the system
Relationship: Both concepts involve suggestions related to system compatibility, highlighting a shared goal of enhancing usability.
Criteria: Someone suggests checking or improving system compatibility.
Phrase: Suggesting system compatibility improvements.

4.
Concepts: describing technical limitation, providing context for design constraints
Relationship: Describing technical limitations provides context for understanding design constraints, which is a logical connection.
Criteria: A user describes a technical limitation that affects their use.
Phrase: Describing technical limitations.

5.
Concepts: providing context for constraints, elaborating on contextual limitations, contextualizing technical constraints
Relationship: All three concepts involve providing context or explanations for limitations or constraints, which shares a common purpose.
Criteria: A user provides context or explanations for limitations or constraints.
Phrase: Providing context for constraints.

6.
Concepts: technical limitation, reiterated technical limitation
Relationship: N/A, as these concepts are similar and do not have a specific logical relationship.
Criteria: A user mentions a technical limitation.
Phrase: Mentioning technical limitations.

7.
Concepts: highlight technical constraints, referencing technical constraints
Relationship: Both concepts involve bringing attention to technical constraints, which shares a common goal.
Criteria: A user highlights or references technical constraints.
Phrase: Highlighting technical constraints.

8.
Concepts: limitation acknowledgment, interaction limitation acknowledgment
Relationship: Both concepts involve acknowledging or recognizing limitations or difficulties, which shares a common purpose.
Criteria: Someone acknowledges limitations or difficulties.
Phrase: Acknowledging limitations.

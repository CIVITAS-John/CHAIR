Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community delves into various aspects, including educational software suggestions, simulation complexities, equipment components like light-sensitive elements, and community dynamics. The Designer plays a role in guiding discussions on features and monetization, while community members engage in exploring technological possibilities and payment methods within the platform.
1. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
Preliminary tags: payment challenges
2. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
Preliminary tags: technological adaptation suggestion
3. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?
Preliminary tags: payment methods discussion
4. P14: It seems a bit troublesome.
5. P2: ……
6. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now.
7. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.
8. Designer: That's true.
9. Designer: Let's just click on ads, hh.
10. P14: Yes, that's fine.
11. P2: What's wrong with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
12. P2: A middle schooler is better than you.
13. P11: I just hope that ads won't take up too much space on the interface.
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood.
15. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method.
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: The ads won't be permanent.
19. Designer: We just want you to click on ads to earn points, and then use the points to unlock new content.
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come and hit me along the network cable.
21. P2: I know how to code.
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 280]
24. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is really annoying.
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen isn't big and it's still got psoriasis.
27. P2: It even forces you to click.
28. P2: What do you need ads for, @Designer 
29. Designer: Health...
30. Designer: Doing this requires hiring people...
31. P1: It's free.
32. Designer: Actually, it's similar to charging money, but if you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay...
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do more of it.
35. Designer: There are some other ways as well.

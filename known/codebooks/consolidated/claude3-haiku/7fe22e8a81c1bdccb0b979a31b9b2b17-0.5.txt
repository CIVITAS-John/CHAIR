Qualitative codes:
1. community feedback
Instances where users provide feedback or suggestions to the developers of the Physics Lab software; instances where members provide feedback, suggestions, or ideas for improving the software or community; instances where community members provide feedback or suggestions to the designer.

2. software updates and roadmap
Instances where the software developer communicates updates or changes to the community; instances where the designer shares information about the software's development, updates, and future plans.

3. community collaboration
Includes sub-codes related to community members sharing resources, working together on projects, or co-creating content/features for the platform.

4. feature requests
Instances where members provide suggestions, feedback, or requests for features to be included in the software.

5. community engagement
Instances where members of the online community interact with each other, share information, or participate in discussions; instances where users express appreciation, ask questions, or provide feedback to the community; instances where users actively participate in the online community by asking questions, providing suggestions, or expressing opinions; instances where members of the online group actively participate and interact with the designer or the product.

6. professional identity
Instances where members of the online community express or discuss their professional roles and identities, such as being a teacher.

7. technical support
Instances where members of the online community seek or provide technical assistance or information related to the Physics Lab; discussions related to the technical aspects of the Physics Lab software, such as system requirements, features, and usage; instances where users seek or provide technical assistance related to the software or its compatibility with different systems.

8. prioritizing mechanics content
This code refers to the discussion around prioritizing the development of mechanics-related content, such as demonstrations of mechanical waves, vibrations, and optical experiments, over other topics like electricity and magnetism.

9. updating component representations
This code refers to the discussion around updating the representation of components in the Physics Lab, such as the use of ideal components instead of dry batteries.

10. feature updates
Mentions of new or upcoming features or changes to the Physics Lab software.

11. technical considerations
Factors related to the technical aspects and compatibility of the software.

12. community dynamics

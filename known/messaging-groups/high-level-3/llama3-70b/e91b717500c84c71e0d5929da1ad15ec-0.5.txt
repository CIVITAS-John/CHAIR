You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Here is a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research on how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

---
* Summary
This conversation is an early interaction between designers and users in the Physics Lab online community. It involves discussions about uploading high-definition avatars, sharing development plans, and gathering user suggestions and requirements.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do designers and users interact and negotiate in this online community? How do users' suggestions and requirements influence the development of Physics Lab? What roles do designers play in facilitating user engagement and participation?

# Facilitating User Engagement
## Responding to User Inquiries
Definition: Designers respond to users' questions and requests in a timely and helpful manner.
- "Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?" (line 4)
- "Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement." (line 6)
- "Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up." (line 7)

## Encouraging User Participation
Definition: Designers invite users to contribute to the development of Physics Lab.
- "Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up." (line 7)
- "Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything." (line 10)

# Negotiating Development Priorities
## Prioritizing Development Tasks
Definition: Designers prioritize development tasks based on their own plans and user feedback.
- "Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts." (line 9)

## Gathering User Feedback
Definition: Designers seek user feedback and opinions to inform development decisions.
- "Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything." (line 10)

# Building Community
## Establishing Relationships
Definition: Designers and users establish relationships through greetings and expressions of gratitude.
- "Designer-1: Hello everyone~" (line 6)
- "User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work." (line 11)
- "User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask..." (line 12)

## Sharing Resources
Definition: Designers and users share resources, such as development plans and PC download addresses.
- "Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement." (line 6)
- "User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you." (line 13)

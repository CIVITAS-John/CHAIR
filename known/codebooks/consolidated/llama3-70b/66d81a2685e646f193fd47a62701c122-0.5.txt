You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

19.
Label: setting project priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

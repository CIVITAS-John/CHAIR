You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: community consultation, involving community in development
Relationship: Inclusion (community consultation is a way of involving the community in development)
Criteria: Initiatives or actions that demonstrate a deliberate effort to involve the community in decision-making, development, or feedback.
Label: Community Involvement

2.
Concepts: expressing satisfaction, positive user experience
Relationship: Parallel (expressing satisfaction and positive user experience are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Statements or expressions that convey a positive sentiment towards the Physics Lab online community, its usability, or practicality.
Label: Positive User Sentiment

3.
Concepts: feedback invitation
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Instances where users are explicitly invited to provide feedback or suggestions, or where designers plan to gather feedback in a participatory manner.
Label: Feedback Solicitation

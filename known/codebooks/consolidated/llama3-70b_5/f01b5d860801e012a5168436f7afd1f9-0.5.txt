You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: encouraging designers
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

2.
Label: exploring solutions
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

3.
Label: outlining feature development
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

4.
Label: seeks clarification on the preferred side for circuit diagram intersections
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- User: Left side

5.
Label: especially for all in one touch screen machines without physical keyboards
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

6.
Label: demonstrating responsiveness to feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

7.
Label: suggesting feature improvements
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

8.
Label: acknowledging manual editing
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

9.
Label: considering future expansions
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

10.
Label: expressing needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

18.
Label: the conversation indicates an iterative development process influenced by user feedback and educational needs

Label: seeking confirmation or correction
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

20.
Label: enabling group work

Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

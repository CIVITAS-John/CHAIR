You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: acknowledge ai's helpfulness, acknowledges ai's debugging capabilities
- Users appreciate AI's ability to clarify and detect coding errors.
- Users appreciate AI's debugging capabilities in helping identify missing elements in their work.

2.
Concepts: experiences frustration, express frustration over ai's limitations
- Instances where E04 expresses frustration with the AI's performance or limitations.
- Users encounter repeated issues with AI and, instead of continuing to seek solutions, they critique the limited options provided, expressing frustration.

3.
Concepts: accepts the limitation, acknowledge ai's limitations and constraints
- Interviewees acknowledge limitations of AI based on technical constraints, accepting these as part of the interaction.
- Users acknowledge AI's limitations and identify constraints that restrict their effective use of AI-generated solutions.

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: acknowledge ai's helpfulness, acknowledges ai's debugging capabilities  
Relationship: The concepts are related as both reflect users' recognition of AI's beneficial roles, specifically in aiding problem-solving and coding tasks.  
Criteria: Users recognize and value the AI's ability to assist in clarifying coding issues and detecting errors.  
Phrase: Recognizing AI's usefulness in debugging.

2.
Concepts: experiences frustration, express frustration over ai's limitations  
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as both describe users' negative feelings stemming from their interactions with the AI's inadequacies.  
Criteria: Users articulate their dissatisfaction with the AI's performance and the limitations that hinder their problem-solving efforts.  
Phrase: Voicing frustration about AI limitations.

3.
Concepts: accepts the limitation, acknowledge ai's limitations and constraints  
Relationship: The concepts are logically linked as they both emphasize users' awareness and acceptance of the inherent restrictions posed by AI technology.  
Criteria: Interviewees recognize and accept the constraints of the AI, understanding these limitations as part of their engagement with the technology.  
Phrase: Accepting the constraints of AI.

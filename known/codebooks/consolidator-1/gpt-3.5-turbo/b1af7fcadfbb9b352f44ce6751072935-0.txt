You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* collaborative design
* community building
* laboratory activities
* learning development
* physics concepts
* platform management
* reflective learning
* sensor technology
* social dynamics
* software development
* user interaction

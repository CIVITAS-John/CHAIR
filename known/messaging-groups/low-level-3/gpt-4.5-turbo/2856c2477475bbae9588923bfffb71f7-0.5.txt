You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P13: From freshman year in high school.
Preliminary tags: educational background; personal sharing
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
Preliminary tags: technical inquiry; component discussion
3. P2: @Designer 
Preliminary tags: direct engagement with designer; technical inquiry

6. P2: +1
Preliminary tags: agreement; community support
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 202]
9. P14: How do you say?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Will the condensed liquid not flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year...
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be on electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
32. P1: If you can create a comprehensive and free software, it should be very popular.
33. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's game over.
34. P11: If you include all these, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
35. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
36. P11: Hey, good idea
37. P2: Hehe
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
39. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
40. Designer: The question is
41. Designer: Where does the light come from?
42. P11: What about light?
43. Designer: Are you shining a light bulb on a photosensitive resistor?
44. P2: Touch by hand
45. P14: I think there's no problem
46. Designer: Then it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
47. P2: With Xiaodeng
48. Designer: Microtransactions...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 245]
52. Designer: Let's talk about it later
53. Designer: Can watch ads even without money
54. Designer: The practice of a conscience game
55. P1: Put up ads
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: It doesn't conduct electricity when you touch it
58. Designer: Oh
59. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (...)
60. P11: ðŸ˜‚
61. P11: Just wanted to say
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but I simply don't know how to top up
63. P11: Can also adapt to 3D Touch
64. Designer: Can you top up directly on the app store?

Thoughts: Analyzing the conversation from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and participatory design reveals multiple layers of interaction and engagement. From a learning sciences viewpoint, the discussion reflects peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and problem-solving. The HCI angle highlights how users interact with both the software and each other, suggesting areas for user interface improvements. Participatory design aspects are evident as users directly engage with the Designer, suggesting features and modifications, thus actively participating in the design process of the Physics Lab software.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (9 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
9. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: user 4230 acknowledges experts; makes a request for specific demonstrations in mechanics and optics
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 mentions prioritizing completing the electrical section first; then magnetism; and gathering opinions before starting mechanics
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 emphasizes the importance of gathering opinions before starting the mechanics section
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: user 4230 thanks the designers for their hard work
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: user 4231 asks where to download the pc/interactive whiteboard version of physics lab
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: user 4231 finds the information in the group files and expresses gratitude
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

7. Designer-1 shares an image.
8. Designer-1 announces that dry batteries will no longer be ideal components in the next update.
9. Designer-1 introduces the student power supply as an ideal component supporting both DC and AC.

Summary: The users actively engage with the platform by making specific requests and seeking information, while the designers prioritize completing different sections based on user feedback and their planned roadmap. The designers also make announcements about upcoming changes to the components available in Physics Lab.

Notes: The community seems appreciative and actively involved in shaping the development of Physics Lab. The designers value user opinions and feedback, incorporating them into their decision-making process. The shift in components indicates a responsiveness to user needs and a commitment to improving the platform based on user experiences.

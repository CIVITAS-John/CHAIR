You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not write repetitive ones.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: detailed overview of update
Quotes:
- # New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a brief process, rather than immediately. 
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface. 
Support for undoing wire connections, component creation, and deletion. 
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current. 
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key. 

# New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter. 
Added a student power supply (AC/DC ideal power supply). 

# Adjustment of Component Properties
Dry cells now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources. 
Incandescent light bulbs now have voltage-current characteristics parameters and are no longer ideal resistors. 
The resistor law experiment now uses real formulas for calculation with adjustable parameters. 
Hidden terminals 3 and 4. 

# Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue caused by unit conversion when editing properties in the editor. 
Terminal arrows no longer display jumping animations. 
There may be calculation errors in certain circuit connections.

Label: user input/feedback/suggestion with justifications
Quotes:
- It is suggested to add an exit button function for the PC version, as many regions now use all-in-one touch screen computers without physical keyboards.

3.
Label: response to feedback
Quotes:
- Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, and there will probably be another round this weekend.

4.
Label: clarification
Quotes:
- But you can't bring it up without touching the input field, probably like that.
- In that case, shouldn't a virtual keyboard be added to every input field?
- Um... left or right?

5.
Label: response to clarification
Quotes:
- Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

6.
Label: frustration
Quotes:
- But you can't bring it up without touching the input field, probably like that.

7.
Label: elaboration
Quotes:
- I tried it in junior high last time. Now there is a clever way to click on the link button in the upper right corner, pop up the browser, and it won't be full screen anymore... = =

8.
Label: confirmation
Quotes:
- @John Chen (3) Yes, that's right.

9.
Label: design/feature suggestion
Quotes:
- It would be convenient to have an export function, or save and import experiments. We can set the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

10.
Label: contextualizing response
Quotes:
- Generally not, since one time during a city-level public class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

11.
Label: humor
Quotes:
- Yes, the spirit of continuous improvement like a skilled craftsman ðŸ¤”
- Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

12.
Label: response to question
Quotes:
- I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.

13.
Label: politeness
Quotes:
- Sorry for the midnight crowing :)

14.
Label: greetings
Quotes:
- Hello everyone
- Hello :)

15.
Label: elaboration of response
Quotes:
- This one is more complicated, so it will take some more time... Hopefully it will be ready for release this week

16.
Label: design rationale
Quotes:
- We try to design it to be usable without additional instructions, or we will provide some tips when you first open it based on feedback

17.
Label: user need
Quotes:
- Need a user manual for this software

18.
Label: encouraging elaboration
Quotes:
- Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?

19.
Label: design suggestion
Quotes:
- This is great, hoping it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams. Also, it would be great to have a function to hide the background grid with one click, making it easier for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no convenient software for drawing circuit diagrams for circuit-related questions.

21.
Label: current efforts
Quotes:
- Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

22.
Label: future update
Quotes:
- Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics is figured out; it will take some time
- Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later

23.
Label: suggestion
Quotes:
- This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, and may produce some weird results.
- You can also include mechanics experiments

24.
Label: elaboration of suggestion
Quotes:
- For example, after connecting the physical diagram, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram, or vice versa

25.
Label: user satisifcation
Quotes:
- The 3D effect of your software is very good

26.
Label: explanation
Quotes:
- With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do exercises in the application

27.
Label: expression of interest
Quotes:
- I am also a bit interested in chemistry

28.
Label: ethusiasm
Quotes:
- Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- This is a really good idea

29.
Label: offering co-designing
Quotes:
- When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group

30.
Label: teacher-admin interaction
Quotes:
- I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

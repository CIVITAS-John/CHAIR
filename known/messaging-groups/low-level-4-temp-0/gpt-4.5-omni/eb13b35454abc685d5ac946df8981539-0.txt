You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: share workaround; reference personal experience
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: confirm understanding; agree with suggestion
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: suggest new feature; highlight practical need; describe use case
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: confirm future feature; acknowledge suggestion
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquire about context; seek additional information
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: describe context; explain limitation; provide rationale
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

15. apologize for timing; show consideration
16. inquire about download process; seek assistance
17. apologize for interruption; show politeness
18. suggest group sharing; provide solution; facilitate access

Summary: The conversation revolves around the interaction between a designer and users discussing the Physics Lab software. User-4232 shares a workaround for a technical issue and suggests new features like export functionality, highlighting the practical need for offline use due to internet restrictions in schools. Designer-1 confirms the future inclusion of the feature and inquires about the classroom context, leading to a discussion about common practices in schools to disable internet access. User-4232 praises the software's simulation effect and shares their teaching background, while Designer-1 provides updates on the software's release. User-4233 inquires about the download process, and Designer-2 suggests group sharing as a solution.

Notes: The conversation highlights the participatory design process, where user feedback directly influences design decisions. The context of internet restrictions in schools is a significant factor shaping the design requirements. The positive feedback from User-4232 indicates the software's effectiveness in engaging students. The designers' responsiveness and willingness to incorporate user suggestions demonstrate a user-centered approach.

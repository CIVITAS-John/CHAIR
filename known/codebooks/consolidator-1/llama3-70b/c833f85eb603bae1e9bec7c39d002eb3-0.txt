You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging? 
Yes, some categories seem to be related, such as "community interaction" and "social interaction dynamics", which could be merged into a single category.

- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
The "Community Building" category seems quite broad and could be split into more specific categories, such as "Community Development" and "Community Culture".

- Is any naming inaccurate?
The name "Technical Environment" might be too broad, as it includes both "collaboration tools" and "technical infrastructure". A more specific name, such as "Technical Infrastructure", might be more accurate.

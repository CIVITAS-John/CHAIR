You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
Preliminary tags: software testing; interface flexibility
2. Designer: [Image 2-102]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
3. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
Preliminary tags: user appreciation; community engagement
4. P4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
Preliminary tags: user inquiry about software update
5. Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

9. Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
10. Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout
11. Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
12. P4234: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”
13. Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
14. Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first
15. Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features

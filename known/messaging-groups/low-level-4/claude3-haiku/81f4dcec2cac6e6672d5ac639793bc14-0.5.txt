You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: describing plans to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; including features like zero adjustment; to enhance the electricity focused capabilities of the software
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: positively evaluating the idea presented in the previous message
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: committing to consulting the community when ready to implement new features
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Preliminary phrases: seeking input from the teacher community on the types of circuit diagram intersections used in current textbooks
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: presenting a specific circuit diagram intersection and seeking confirmation
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirming that the presented circuit diagram intersection is the common one used in current textbooks
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

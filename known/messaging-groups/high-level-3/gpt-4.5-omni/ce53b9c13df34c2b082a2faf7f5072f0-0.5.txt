You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
4. User-4233: How to download?
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
6. Designer-2: Group sharing.
7. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

* Summary
The conversation involves a mix of users and designers discussing the development and features of Physics Lab, an educational software tool. Users inquire about downloading the software and express their teaching experience, while designers provide updates on software versions, upcoming features, and encourage community feedback for future development.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will examine it from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and participatory design. Key guiding questions include: How do users' educational backgrounds influence their engagement with the software? How do designers facilitate user interaction and feedback? What role does community input play in the software development process? These angles will help us understand the dynamics that contributed to the emergence of Physics Lab's online community.

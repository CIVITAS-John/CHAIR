You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

* Summary
The conversation involves a designer of Physics Lab asking for help to upload a high-definition avatar, and a user responding with a question about using the PC version. The user then confirms they are a teacher.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, I will use the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will look for themes related to how the online community emerged, including the role of designers, user engagement, and collaboration between designers and users. I will pay particular attention to how the designers and users interact, what tools and resources they use, and how they work together to create and maintain the community.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation reveals the emergence of a collaborative and responsive online community around the Physics Lab software. The designers are actively engaging with users, soliciting feedback, and outlining their plans for future updates and features. Users express enthusiasm for the software and provide specific requests and suggestions, which the designers seem receptive to incorporating. The discussion covers a range of topics, including the software's download process, upcoming updates, user experience, and potential new features. The designers demonstrate a commitment to continuous improvement and a willingness to adapt the software based on user needs.
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary phrases: reiterating the bidirectional conversion feature
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary phrases: suggesting a focused; iterative approach to development rather than aiming for completeness
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary phrases: acknowledging the user's suggestion
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

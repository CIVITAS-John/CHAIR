You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: respond to questions, responding indirectly
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe ways of responding to questions, with the second concept being a more indirect approach.
Criteria: Designers respond to questions or inquiries, often indirectly or with a question of their own.
Phrase: Respond indirectly to questions.

2.
Concepts: request updates, respond to feature request
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe interactions around feature requests, with one being the initiation of the request and the other being the response to it.
Criteria: Users request updates or new features, and designers respond to these requests.
Phrase: Address feature requests.

3.
Concepts: proposing a design idea, proposing solutions
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the act of proposing solutions, with one being more focused on design ideas and the other on solutions in general.
Criteria: Designers and users propose design ideas or solutions to address challenges and problems.
Phrase: Propose solutions.

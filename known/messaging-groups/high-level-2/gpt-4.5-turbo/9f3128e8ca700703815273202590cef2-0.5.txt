63. P11: Check it out online, this can't be explained in a few words. @P2 
64. P2: Can a motor be added? @Designer 
65. P14: I think I should stick to doing math.
66. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
67. Designer: Ours will be simpler, more practical (closer to exams), and cheaper.
68. P11: ðŸ˜‚
69. P11: Hmm, ask the group owner.
70. Designer: After all, it's not specifically for astronomy.
71. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
72. P2: [Image 1-144]
73. P2: As far as I know.
74. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in Physics Lab?
75. Designer: Motor simulation is quite complicated and related to the load.
76. Designer: Calculated...
77. P2: How is it calculated?
78. P11: Okay.
79. P11: Because of that rectifier last time, I naively thought it was a preset model.
80. P11: [Image 1-152]
81. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but it's an atomized model.
82. Designer: Pursuing precision, a phone can't handle the calculations.
83. P1: Server?
84. P11: Hahaha.
85. Designer: Standalone.
86. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
87. Designer: Two types of motors.
88. P1: Are you on the server?
89. P2: There are brush motors.
90. P2: Not brushless motors connected to AC power.
91. P14: Finally talking about something I can understand
92. P2: You don't understand brushless motors
93. P2: It's hard to make it work
94. P4: Making a motor is quite simple if you follow my method @Designer 
95. P14: [Image 1-168]
96. P2: What if it burns out?
97. P4: Just power it up and play a rotating animation, that's it ðŸ˜‚
98. P2: Do you still need an algorithm?
99. P4: ðŸ˜‚ Simple and done
100. P2: Algorithms are not simple
101. P2: igdt can also be added @Designer 
102. P13: [Image 1-175]
103. P13: Are you all fake?
104. P13: Are you from outer space?
105. P13: I don't understand
106. P2: Transistors can also be used
107. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do that in a normal experiment...
108. P11: ðŸ˜‚ That's in electronic circuits
109. P11: I don't understand either
110. P2: In the CPU
111. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned a bit when I took an elective course on circuits
112. P2: Add a polarized capacitor
113. P2: I learned it all by myself
114. P11: That's great, if you have a passion for it
115. P14: @P11 Do they still separate arts and science tracks now?
116. P2: no
117. P11: We don't separate arts and science tracks anymore
118. P14: [Image 1-191]
119. P14: ...let me get admitted first and then we'll talk
120. P2: I'm still in 2nd year of middle school
121. P11: Keep it up
122. P13: First year of high school
123. P2: What about MOSFETs?
124. P2: @Designer 
125. P17: [Image 1-198]
126. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
127. P2: +1

* Summary
The conversation in the Physics Lab's online message group revolves around various technical subjects, including astronomy, motor simulations, gravitational waves, and software development. Participants share resources, ask questions, and discuss the limitations and functionalities of software and hardware relevant to their studies and interests.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will employ frameworks from learning sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and participatory design. From a learning sciences perspective, we will examine how knowledge is constructed collaboratively in the group. In terms of HCI, we will focus on how participants interact with technology and each other to facilitate learning and problem-solving. Finally, from a participatory design viewpoint, we will analyze how the community members contribute to the design process of the tools they use, indicating a co-creation of technology. Each category in the codebook will help identify and categorize elements relevant to these frameworks.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: development update
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

2.
Label: maintain community interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

3.
Label: indirect reject
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

4.
Label: designer 1 provides development update
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

5.
Label: requested information on encountered problems
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

6.
Label: second the previous response
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

7.
Label: invite user participation
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

8.
Label: developer respnse
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

9.
Label: highlight long term benefits
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

10.
Label: engage in troubleshooting
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- User: Win7 should be fine.

11.
Label: user 4234 inquires about update

Quotes:
- User: Is there a user manual?

13.
Label: ask for teachers' help
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

17.
Label: reiterate need for user manual
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

18.
Label: express gratitude
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.
- User: Thank you.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify low-level descriptive codes for each message.
Codes should attempt to interpret events, actors, and intents.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary codes: feature planning; experimental details
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary codes: positive feedback; enthusiasm
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary codes: community involvement; development planning
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary codes: expert consultation; resource validation
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary codes: visual aid; example sharing
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary codes: confirmation; common practice
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Thoughts: In this conversation, I'll focus on identifying the emergence of the online community around Physics Lab. I'll analyze the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I'll explore how the designers and users interact, share ideas, and collaborate on the development of Physics Lab. Guiding questions: How do the designers involve users in the development process? How do users respond to the designers' ideas and requests? What features and functionalities are being discussed, and how do they relate to the learning sciences and human-computer interaction?

Codes for each message:
1. feature planning; experimental details
2. positive feedback; enthusiasm
3. community involvement; development planning
4. expert consultation; resource validation
5. visual aid; example sharing
6. confirmation; common practice
7. inquiry; clarification
8. development update
9. feedback; direction
10. acknowledgment
11. design refinement
12. suggestion; improvement
13. compromise; consideration
14. development explanation; limitation
15. visual aid; example sharing
16. gratitude; appreciation
17. inquiry; update request
18. update announcement; release schedule
19. update significance; magnitude

Summary: This conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab, with designers seeking input from users on specific features and functionalities. The designers share their plans, ask for feedback, and provide updates on the development process. Users respond with enthusiasm, suggestions, and confirmation of common practices. The conversation highlights the collaborative nature of the online community, with designers and users working together to shape the direction of Physics Lab.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users to ensure that the development of Physics Lab meets their needs and expectations. The use of visual aids and examples facilitates communication and understanding between designers and users. The conversation also suggests that the designers value user feedback and are open to incorporating suggestions into the development process.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
9. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
Preliminary tags: educational content request; physics topics
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
Preliminary tags: prioritization; content development planning
3. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: user input; memory aid
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; community interaction
5. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
Preliminary tags: software download inquiry
6. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
Preliminary tags: community support; resource location
7. Designer: [Image 14]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: When analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, consider the learning sciences perspective to understand how users engage with educational content and how the designer prioritizes content development. From a human-computer interaction standpoint, focus on user input and community support in the online platform. Lastly, through the lens of participatory design, explore how the community interacts with the designer and provides feedback on the platform's features and updates.

Tags for each message:
1. educational content request; physics topics; interactive demonstrations; optical experiments; educational technology
2. prioritization; content development planning; curriculum sequencing; educational priorities
3. user input; community feedback; decision-making; memory aid; user-centered design
4. appreciation; community interaction; gratitude; positive reinforcement
5. software download inquiry; platform accessibility; technology use
6. community support; resource location; user assistance; platform navigation
7. visual content; multimedia communication; non-verbal communication
8. simulation update; component modification; educational tools; practical application
9. electrical components; simulation features; instructional tools; educational technology

Summary: The conversation within the Physics Lab online community revolves around requests for specific educational content, prioritization of content development, gathering user input, expressing appreciation, seeking software download information, providing community support, sharing visual content, and announcing updates to the platform's simulation features.

Notes: The community seems actively engaged in shaping the educational content and platform features, with users making requests and the designer responding with updates and decisions based on community input. The dynamics between the designer and the users reflect a collaborative approach to platform development, emphasizing the importance of user feedback and community support in shaping the Physics Lab online environment.

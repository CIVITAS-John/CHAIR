Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

* Summary
This interaction involves users discussing the availability and features of the PC/interactive whiteboard version of the Physics Lab software, as well as the developers responding to user feedback and suggestions.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, I will focus on the following aspects:

Learning Sciences:
- How the developers are incorporating user feedback to improve the educational features and functionality of the software
- How the software is being designed to support different modes of learning (e.g., interactive whiteboard, PC)

Human-Computer Interaction:
- How the developers are communicating with users and responding to their needs and requests
- The design decisions made to improve the user experience (e.g., removing internal resistance, supporting both DC and AC)

Participatory Design:
- The level of user involvement in the development process
- How the developers are soliciting and incorporating user feedback to shape the software

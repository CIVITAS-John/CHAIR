3. Designer: Sorry for the midnight crowing :)
4. P4233: How to download?
5. P4233: May I ask?
6. P8: Group sharing.
7. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

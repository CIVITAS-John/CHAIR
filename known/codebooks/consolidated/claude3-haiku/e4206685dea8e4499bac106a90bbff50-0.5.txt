You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. community involvement, community participation.
- The designers actively involve the community members in the design process, seeking their input and feedback.
- The community's involvement in the software's design and the designer's responsiveness to their needs.
- The community members' active involvement in the development process, such as providing feedback and requesting features.

2. learning experience, experiential learning.
- The impact of the software's development on the community's learning experience.
- Features of the software that enable students to actively engage in hands-on experiments and explore physics concepts.

3. feedback, seeking feedback.
- Mechanisms within the software that provide students with immediate feedback on their actions and understanding.
- The designers actively seek feedback and input from the community members to inform the design of the simulated electricity experiment assessment feature.

4. user feedback, addressing user feedback.
- Discussions where users provide feedback, suggestions, or comments about the Physics Lab software.
- The designer's acknowledgment and consideration of the community's requests and feedback.

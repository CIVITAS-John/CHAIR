You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: The conversation so far provides some insights into the emergence of the Physics Lab online community. The initial messages discuss the background of a teacher (P4232) and the release of a new version of the Physics Lab app on the Apple market. This suggests that the community may have started with users who were teachers or educators interested in the app. The subsequent messages indicate that the community is also interested in features and updates to the app, as well as the ability to download and share content within the group. The emoji responses suggest a positive and engaged community. To further understand the community's emergence, it would be helpful to explore the initial formation of the group, how users were onboarded, and what motivated them to participate in the community.

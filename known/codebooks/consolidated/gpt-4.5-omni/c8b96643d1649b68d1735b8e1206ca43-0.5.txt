You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate label to best represent the code.
The research question is: What ideas did students develop in this note?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {The most representative label for the concepts}

Concepts: community knowledge sharing, collective learning discussions
- Students build learning communities through collaborative reflection and shared knowledge experiences.
- Students participate in cross-group discussions and propose structured interactions for knowledge sharing.

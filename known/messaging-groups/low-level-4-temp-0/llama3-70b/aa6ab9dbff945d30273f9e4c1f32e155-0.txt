You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (9 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
9. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: first; let's pay homage to the experts; then i'll make a small request. could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations; such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves; wave superposition; diffraction; and interference? also; for optical experiments; it would be great to have optical benches; single slits; double slits; and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments; expressing gratitude; making feature requests; demonstrating domain expertise
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: hmm... we will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first; then magnetism; and then other parts; responding to feature requests; outlining development priorities
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: okay; okay~ thank you for your hard work; expressing understanding; showing appreciation
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: [ emoji 2 12] hello everyone; may i ask where i can download the pc / interactive whiteboard version of physics lab?; greeting the community; inquiring about resources
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: 
In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on understanding the context and intent behind each message. I'll explore how the designers and users interact, what features are being requested, and how the community is emerging. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective, examining how users are engaging with the Physics Lab platform and what they're trying to achieve. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll analyze how the designers are responding to user requests and how the platform is being developed. Finally, I'll look at the participatory design aspects, observing how users are influencing the development process and how designers are involving users in decision-making.

Interpretations for each message:

1. expressing gratitude; making feature requests; demonstrating domain expertise
2. responding to feature requests; outlining development priorities; setting expectations
3. soliciting user feedback; acknowledging limitations; planning for future development
4. expressing understanding; showing appreciation; acknowledging effort
5. greeting the community; inquiring about resources; seeking support
6. finding resources; expressing gratitude; feeling relieved
7. sharing visual information; providing updates; engaging with users
8. announcing changes; explaining updates; setting new expectations
9. explaining features; highlighting capabilities; educating users

Summary:
The conversation begins with a user requesting features for mechanical waves and optical experiments, demonstrating their expertise in the domain. The designer responds by outlining development priorities and soliciting user feedback. Another user joins the conversation, inquiring about resources and expressing gratitude when they're found. The designer shares updates and explains changes to the platform, including the removal of ideal components and the introduction of new features.

Notes:
It appears that the users are driving the development process by making feature requests and providing feedback. The designers are responsive to these requests, outlining their priorities and soliciting input from users. The community is emerging as a collaborative space where users can engage with each other and with the designers. The designers seem to be prioritizing the development of the electrical section, followed by magnetism and other parts. The users are interested in exploring different aspects of physics, including mechanical waves and optical experiments.

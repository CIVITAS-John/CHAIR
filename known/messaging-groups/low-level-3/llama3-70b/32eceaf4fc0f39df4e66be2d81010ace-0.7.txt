You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (3 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...
...
3. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on identifying the context, actors, and intents in each message. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective to explore how the online community is emerging through user interactions. I'll also examine the human-computer interaction aspect to understand how the platform's design influences user behavior. Finally, I'll apply participatory design principles to analyze the roles of designers and users in shaping the community.

Codes for each message:
1. 
2. Intent: Avatar customization; Issue: Technical difficulty; Actor: Designer-1; Resource: Avatar
3. Question type: Clarification; Topic: Platform version; Actor: User-4229

Summary: The conversation begins with an image shared by Designer-2, followed by Designer-1 asking about uploading a high-definition avatar. User-4229 responds with a question about the PC version of the platform.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively participating in the community and seeking technical assistance. The presence of an image and discussion around avatars suggests that customization and self-expression are important aspects of the online community. The question about the PC version implies that users are interested in accessing the platform across different devices.

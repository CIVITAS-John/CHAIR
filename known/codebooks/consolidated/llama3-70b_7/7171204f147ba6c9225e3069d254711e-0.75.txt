You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: ai assistance, wiki type of assistance on the side
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the role of AI as a supportive tool, with the wiki-type assistance on the side implying a readily available reference for users.
Criteria: Participants envision AI as a facilitator of assistance and learning, providing readily available syntax references.
Phrase: Envisions AI as a supportive assistant.

2.
Concepts: ai potential benefits, productivity enhancement
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the positive outcomes of using AI-driven interfaces, with productivity enhancement being a specific benefit.
Criteria: Participants discuss the potential benefits of using AI-driven interfaces to enhance productivity or learning.
Phrase: Discusses AI-driven interface benefits.

3.
Concepts: valuing ai efficiency, argues for ai efficiency
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the importance of time-saving and efficiency in AI-driven interfaces, with participants arguing in favor of this aspect.
Criteria: Participants value and argue for the time-saving potential of AI-driven interfaces to increase efficiency.
Phrase: Values AI-driven efficiency.

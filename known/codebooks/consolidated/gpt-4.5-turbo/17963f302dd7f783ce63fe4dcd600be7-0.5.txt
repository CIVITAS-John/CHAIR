You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1. feedback integration, feedback on implementation.
- Instances where feedback from community members is acknowledged or integrated into design decisions.
- Feedback given by community members on how certain features or designs should be implemented.

2. verbal inquiry, request for information.
- Instances where participants ask questions to seek clarification or additional information.
- Moments where participants explicitly ask for more information or clarification.

3. questioning and inquiry, inquiry and clarification.
- Moments where participants ask questions to understand concepts better or to probe deeper into a topic.
- Instances where participants either ask questions to gain a clearer understanding or seek further explanations to deepen their knowledge within the community.

4. external resources suggestion, resource recommendations.
- Recommendations made by participants to use external tools or sources to gain further information or clarification.
- Instances where participants recommend or direct others to external materials or tools that can aid in further learning or project development.

5. request for administration, request for administrative action.
- Instances where participants express the need for administrative intervention or presence in the group.
- Instances where group members express needs or requests related to the management or moderation of the online community.

6. inquiry and response.
- Instances where questions are asked and answered, facilitating knowledge exchange.
- The process where a question is posed by one community member and answered by others, facilitating shared understanding and learning.
- Instances where participants ask questions and receive answers, reflecting interactive learning and problem-solving.
- Instances where a participant asks a question and receives an answer, reflecting collaborative problem-solving and knowledge sharing.

7. technical discussion.
- Exchanges that involve sharing specific technical knowledge or clarifications about complex concepts.
- Conversations that focus on specific technical aspects or problem-solving related to physics or technology.

8. expression of agreement.
- Instances where participants express agreement or solidarity with a previous statement.

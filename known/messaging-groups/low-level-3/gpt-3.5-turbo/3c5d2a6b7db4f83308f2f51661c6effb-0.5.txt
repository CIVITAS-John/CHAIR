You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Hello
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: There will be more people here once the official version is released.
5. Designer: Probably because the teacher finds too much talking annoying ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image 1-6]
8. P5: ðŸ˜‚ By the way, I'm here to see if there are any good designs to reference.
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: For example, a microcomputer.

Thoughts: In analyzing these messages, consider the emerging community dynamics, the role of the Designer in shaping the community, the users' motivations for being part of the community, and the potential influence of design elements on user engagement and participation.

Tags for each message:
1. Community dynamics; Non-verbal communication; Disapproval
2. Greeting; Engagement
3. Designer interaction; Engagement
4. Community growth; Future expectations; Engagement
5. Community norms; Humor; Teacher influence
6. Greeting
7. Visual content sharing; Engagement
8. Design inspiration; Seeking references; Engagement
9. Design evaluation; Engagement
10. Design discussion; Specific design example; Engagement

Summary: The conversation starts with non-verbal disapproval from P1, followed by greetings from P2 and the Designer. The Designer hints at future community growth and jokes about teacher influence on the community. Users engage by sharing visual content, seeking design references, and discussing specific design examples like microcomputers.

Notes: The Designer seems to play a significant role in shaping the community and setting expectations for future growth. Users are actively engaging with each other and the Designer, indicating a developing online community around design discussions. The influence of humor and shared interests in design is evident in user interactions.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. P14: How do you say?
2. P14: [Image 299]
3. P17: Brainiac.
4. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
5. P18: Just downloaded it.
6. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10
7. P6: When will it be updated?
8. P20: Why does that fuse keep burning out?

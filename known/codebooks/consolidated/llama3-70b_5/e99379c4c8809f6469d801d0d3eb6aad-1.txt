You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: open to alternatives
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

2.
Label: design discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

3.
Label: suggest educational enhancements
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Did you make categories too large?
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Revise and rewrite the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
Upon reviewing the merged categories, I noticed that some categories might be too large, such as "Learning Design" and "Online Engagement". These categories might benefit from further splitting to maintain a more granular level of analysis.

Additionally, categories like "Community Characteristics" and "User Insights" might be too broad and could be further refined.

I did not identify any inaccurate naming, but some categories might benefit from more descriptive names.

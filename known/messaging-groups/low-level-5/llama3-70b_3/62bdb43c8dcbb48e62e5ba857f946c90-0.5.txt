You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (10 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
10. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary phrases: shares professional background; establishes credibility
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
Preliminary phrases: provides update on software development; sets expectations for release
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
Preliminary phrases: apologizes for potential disturbance; shows consideration for users
4. User-4233: How to download?
Preliminary phrases: requests information; seeks guidance on downloading
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary phrases: apologizes for interruption; shows politeness
6. Designer-2: Group sharing.
Preliminary phrases: suggests new feature; promotes collaborative functionality
7. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
9. User-4234: [Emoji 2-56]
10. User-4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on capturing the actions, intentions, and contexts of the online community's emergence. I'll consider the roles of designers and users, their interactions, and the language used. I'll explore how the designers' updates, apologies, and invitations shape the community's dynamics. I'll also examine how users' requests, apologies, and reactions influence the conversation. Guiding questions include: How do designers establish credibility and set expectations? How do users initiate interactions and respond to designers' updates?

Interpretation phrases for each item:

1. shares professional background; establishes credibility; provides context for future interactions;
2. provides update on software development; sets expectations for release; demonstrates transparency;
3. apologizes for potential disturbance; shows consideration for users; sets tone for respectful communication;
4. requests information; seeks guidance on downloading; initiates interaction with designers;
5. apologizes for interruption; shows politeness; demonstrates awareness of social norms;
6. suggests new feature; promotes collaborative functionality; encourages user engagement;
7. provides instructions; offers solution to user's query; demonstrates responsiveness;
8. shares development roadmap; invites user feedback; encourages participatory design; 
9. expresses excitement or playfulness; responds to designers' update; adds emotional tone to conversation;
10. expresses enthusiasm or agreement; responds to designers' update; reinforces positive atmosphere;

Summary: The conversation begins with a user sharing their professional background, followed by designers' updates on software development and apologies for potential disturbances. Users then initiate interactions, requesting information and seeking guidance, while designers respond with instructions and invitations for feedback. The conversation is characterized by politeness, consideration, and a focus on collaboration and participatory design.

Notes: It seems that designers are actively engaging with users, providing updates, and inviting feedback, which may contribute to the emergence of a collaborative online community. Users are responding positively, showing enthusiasm and politeness. The use of emojis adds an emotional tone to the conversation, which may influence the community's dynamics. I'll continue to explore these themes in subsequent coding rounds.

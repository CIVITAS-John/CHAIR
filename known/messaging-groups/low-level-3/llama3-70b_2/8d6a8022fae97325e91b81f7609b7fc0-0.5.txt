You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary tags: software development; simulation based assessment; experimental details
2. P4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary tags: design validation; community feedback; feature enthusiasm
3. Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary tags: community involvement; participatory design; design iteration
4. Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary tags: teacher consultation; circuit diagram design; textbook integration
5. Designer: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary tags: diagram example; circuit diagram design; teacher feedback
6. P4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary tags: community feedback; circuit diagram convention; design consideration
7. Designer: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer: We are working on this part
9. P4234: Left side
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Make it simpler...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer: So, use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer: The update is quite large...

Thoughts: I will analyze this conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I'll explore how the designer engages with the community, solicits feedback, and incorporates it into the design process. I'll also examine how the community responds to the designer's ideas and provides input. I'll pay attention to the language and tone used by the designer and the community members, as well as the role of images and emojis in the conversation.

Summary: The conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab, with the designer engaging with the community to gather feedback on circuit diagram design and simulation-based assessment. The designer shares ideas, solicits input, and incorporates feedback into the design process. The community responds with enthusiasm, provides feedback, and asks questions about the development process. The conversation highlights the participatory design approach, where the designer and community collaborate to shape the development of Physics Lab.

Notes: The designer's tone is open and collaborative, seeking feedback and input from the community. The community responds positively, providing feedback and encouragement. The use of images and emojis adds a visual and emotional layer to the conversation, facilitating communication and engagement. The conversation suggests that the designer values community input and is committed to incorporating it into the design process.

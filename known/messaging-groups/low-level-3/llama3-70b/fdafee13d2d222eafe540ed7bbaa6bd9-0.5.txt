You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify low-level descriptive codes for each message.
Codes should attempt to interpret events, actors, and intents.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary codes: : personal anecdote; technical workaround sharing
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary codes: : acknowledgement; agreement expression
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary codes: : feature request; workflow optimization suggestion
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary codes: : feature implementation commitment; development priority discussion
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary codes: : context inquiry; infrastructure exploration
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary codes: : context explanation; infrastructure limitation discussion
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Thoughts: 
In this conversation, I will focus on identifying the emergence of the online community around Physics Lab. I will analyze the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will look for codes that relate to the design and development of Physics Lab, user experiences, and the interactions between designers and users. I will also explore how the conversation reveals the needs and concerns of the users and how the designers respond to them.

Codes for each message:

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
    * personal experience sharing; technical tip sharing; pedagogical context

2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
    * acknowledgement; agreement expression; social bonding

3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
    * feature request; workflow optimization suggestion; teacher's needs expression

4. Designer-1: There will be.
    * feature implementation commitment; development priority discussion; responsiveness to user needs

5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
    * context inquiry; infrastructure exploration; understanding user context

6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
    * context explanation; infrastructure limitation discussion; school policy influence

7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
    * emotional response; empathy expression

8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
    * design insight; feature prioritization; user needs consideration

9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
    * context explanation; infrastructure limitation discussion; school policy influence

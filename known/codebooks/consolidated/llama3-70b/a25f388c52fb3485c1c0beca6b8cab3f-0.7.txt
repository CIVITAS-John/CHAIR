You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: suggesting a focused and iterative development approach
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

7.
Label: highlighting the focus of physics lab on electricity and mechanics
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

8.
Label: with potential future expansion into other areas based on user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

Label: user expressing agreement or affirmation
Quotes:
- User: Indeed

10.
Label: considering the possibility of incorporating chemistry related experiments based on suitable opportunities
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

11.
Label: outlining plans for creating a simulated experiment assessment function for electricity
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

12.
Label: user expressing enthusiasm and approval for the proposed idea
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

13.
Label: seeking input from teachers in the group regarding the types of circuit diagrams used in current textbooks
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

20.
Label: considering a hybrid approach based on user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

21.
Label: informing users about the testing nature of a specific feature and potential issues with the auto layout algorithm
Quotes:

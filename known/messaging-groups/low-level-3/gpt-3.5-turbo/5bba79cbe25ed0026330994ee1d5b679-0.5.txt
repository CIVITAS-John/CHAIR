You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation covers a range of topics including technical discussions on components like MOSFETs and superconductors, chemistry references such as potassium permanganate, and user interactions with the designer. Users also discuss the functionality of equipment like test tubes, share images, and provide feedback on the platform's features and functionalities. The discussion reflects a mix of educational levels, humor, agreement, and suggestions for software improvements.
1. P2: What about superconductors?
Preliminary tags: technical component discussion; superconductors
2. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a larger amount of computation...
Preliminary tags: simulation challenges; computational requirements
3. P1: If you have the ability to make a comprehensive and free one, it should be very popular
Preliminary tags: participatory design; user generated content
4. P2: If the CPU is bad, it's game over
5. P11: Adding what you said, it wouldn't be "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: It's a series of lab courses
7. P11: Hey, good idea
8. P2: Hehe
9. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is very annoying?
10. P2: @Designer Can you add a light sensor?
11. Designer: The problem is
12. Designer: Where does the light come from
13. P11: What about the light
14. Designer: Are you using a small bulb to illuminate the photoresistor?
15. P2: Tap with your hand
16. P14: I think there's no problem
17. Designer: Isn't that just a variable resistor, except the curve is different (â€¦â€¦)
18. P2: And a small light
19. Designer: Micro-payment maybe...
20. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
21. P2: ï¼Ÿ
22. P14: [Image 1-245]
23. Designer: We'll see
24. Designer: If you don't have money, you can also click on ads
25. Designer: It's the approach of a conscientious game
26. P1: Put up ads
27. Designer: Hmm.
28. P2: If you tap and release, it won't conduct electricity
29. Designer: Oh
30. Designer: Forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (â€¦â€¦)
31. P11: ðŸ˜‚
32. P11: Just about to say
33. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but that you don't know how to pay
34. P11: It can also be adapted to 3D touch
35. Designer: Just charge directly through the app store?

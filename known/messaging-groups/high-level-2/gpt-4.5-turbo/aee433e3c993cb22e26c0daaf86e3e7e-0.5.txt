Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

* Summary
In this interaction within the Physics Lab online message group, a participant (Designer) asks for help on how to upload a high-definition version of an avatar and queries another participant (P4229) if they are a teacher, to which P4229 confirms.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will apply theories from learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. From a learning sciences perspective, we can explore the roles and identities of participants (e.g., teacher) and how these impact interactions and knowledge sharing. In human-computer interaction, we can examine usability issues and user experience expressed in the conversation, such as the ease of uploading high-quality images. From a participatory design angle, we will consider how the community collaborates to improve the system or tools they are using (e.g., avatar quality), highlighting the collective problem-solving process. Key questions include: How do participants' roles influence their contributions? What usability challenges are identified, and how do they affect user experience? How does the community engage in collaborative design practices?

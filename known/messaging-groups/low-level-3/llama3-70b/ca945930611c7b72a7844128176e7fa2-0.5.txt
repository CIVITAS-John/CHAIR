You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary tags: feature planning; simulated experiment assessment; experimental details
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary tags: user enthusiasm; idea validation; community support
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary tags: community engagement; participatory design; development planning
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary tags: teacher consultation; textbook analysis; circuit diagram standards
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary tags: image based communication; visual aids; circuit diagram examples
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary tags: user confirmation; common practice; old style circuit diagrams
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: This conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab, with designers and users interacting to shape the platform's features and design. The conversation touches on community engagement, design decision-making, and feature development, with a focus on circuit diagrams and simulated experiment assessment. The designers are actively seeking feedback and input from the community, demonstrating participatory design principles.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the designers are actively engaging with the community, seeking feedback and input on design decisions. This participatory approach may be contributing to the community's enthusiasm and sense of ownership. The conversation also highlights the importance of visual aids and image-based communication in facilitating design discussions. I'll continue to explore these themes as I analyze the conversation further.

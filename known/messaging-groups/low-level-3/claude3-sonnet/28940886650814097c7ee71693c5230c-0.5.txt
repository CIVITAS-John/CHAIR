You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. P8: [Image 0]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without watermark for this profile picture?
3. P4229: pc version?
4. Designer: Let me upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation through the lens of learning sciences, participatory design, and HCI, I will look for tags related to community roles and norms, technical affordances and constraints, and indications of an emerging online community. Some guiding questions are: What roles are the participants taking on? How are technical features shaping the interaction? What community dynamics are emerging?

Tags for each message (5 in total):
1. requesting-feature; profile-picture; image-upload
2. designer-role; community-management 
3. checking-user-role; teacher-role
4. designer-role; attempting-image-upload
5. confirming-role; teacher-role

Summary: The conversation starts with P8 sharing an image, likely a profile picture. The designer then asks how to upload a higher resolution profile picture without a watermark. P4229 asks if this request is for the PC version of the platform. The designer confirms they will try uploading an image and asks if P4229 is a teacher. P4229 confirms their role as a teacher. This exchange suggests an emerging online community with different user roles (designer, teacher) and a desire to customize profile images as a form of identity expression.

Notes: The ability to upload profile pictures seems important for user representation and identity in this online community. There may be different technical constraints or affordances for profile images between PC and mobile versions. The designer is taking an active community management role in responding to user needs. The teacher role implies there may be educational use cases for this platform. Overall, we see some early dynamics of an online community forming around this platform.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (7 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Phrase: Interact naturally with AI.

2.
Concepts: experiences limitations, expressing frustration with ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the participants' negative experiences with AI-driven interfaces, with the second concept specifying the emotional response to these limitations.
Criteria: Participants experience and express frustration with AI-driven interfaces' limitations.
Phrase: Express frustration with AI limitations.

3.
Concepts: non-deterministic, experiencing ai unpredictability
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the participants' experiences with the unpredictable nature of AI-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants experience non-deterministic results from AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Experience AI unpredictability.

4.
Concepts: critiquing error messages, expresses frustration with error messages
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the participants' negative evaluations of error messages, with the second concept specifying the emotional response to these messages.
Criteria: Participants critique and express frustration with unclear error messages.
Phrase: Critique error messages.

5.
Concepts: writing code with ai guidance, uses ai-generated code as reference

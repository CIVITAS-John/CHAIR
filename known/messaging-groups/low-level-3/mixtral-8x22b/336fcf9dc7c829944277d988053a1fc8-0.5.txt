You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary tags: content request; learning sciences; physics demonstrations
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary tags: content prioritization; development plan; user feedback
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: content planning; community engagement; user feedback
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: user gratitude; community engagement; user feedback
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary tags: platform inquiry; accessibility; user interface
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary tags: platform access; user inquiry; user interface
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Summary: The conversation begins with a user requesting specific physics demonstrations related to mechanical waves and optical experiments. The designer responds by outlining the development plan, which prioritizes the electrical section before moving on to mechanics. The designer also expresses the intention to gather more user feedback before starting on mechanics. Another user inquires about the platform accessibility, specifically asking about the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab. The designer then announces an upcoming update that will change the functionality of dry batteries and introduces a new student power supply component.

Notes: The conversation illustrates the active engagement of the online community in the development process. The users are not only requesting content but also providing feedback and inquiring about platform accessibility. The designer is responsive to this feedback and is incorporating it into the development plan. The focus on physics demonstrations aligns with the learning sciences perspective, as these demonstrations can enhance understanding of complex concepts. The conversation also touches on human-computer interaction, as users inquire about platform accessibility and the designer announces updates to the user interface.

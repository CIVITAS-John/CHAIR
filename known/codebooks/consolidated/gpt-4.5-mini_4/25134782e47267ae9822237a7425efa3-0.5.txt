You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: acknowledge user input, acknowledgment and implementation
- Designers confirm they will consider and implement user suggestions while affirming user feedback regarding feature support.
- Designers acknowledging user feedback and discussing plans to implement suggested features.

2.
Concepts: system compatibility
- The designer discusses compatibility issues related to different operating systems.
- A designer outlines the system requirements for compatibility and confirms the need to check these requirements.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: acknowledge user input, acknowledgment and implementation
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both focus on the process of recognizing user feedback and the subsequent actions taken to incorporate that feedback into the design.
Criteria: Designers confirmed they would consider user suggestions and affirmed their feedback while discussing plans for implementation.
Phrase: Acknowledge and implement user feedback

2.
Concepts: system compatibility
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both address the importance of ensuring that the design works across various operating systems and the necessity of verifying system requirements.
Criteria: The designer discussed compatibility issues and outlined the system requirements necessary for ensuring compatibility.
Phrase: Discuss system compatibility requirements

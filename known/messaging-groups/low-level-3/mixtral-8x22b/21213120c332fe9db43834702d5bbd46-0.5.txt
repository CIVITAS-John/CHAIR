You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation begins with a user greeting the group, followed by a designer sharing about group sharing and software updates. Users inquire about software updates and features, and the designer responds with information about upcoming updates, including a multimeter, powered solenoid, and semiconductor capacitor. Users also express their need for a user manual and request mechanics experiments to be included. The designer shares their research on bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams and their goal to develop electromagnetism features before the end of the year. Users provide feedback on the software's usability and features.
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary tags: designer 1; software feature; bidirectional conversion; physical diagram; circuit diagram
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary tags: user 4232; software development approach; categorization; refinement
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary tags: designer 1; software development approach; user feedback; user interaction
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

Thoughts: The conversation continues with the designer and users discussing software updates and features, focusing on electricity and mechanics. The designer seeks user feedback on specific features and plans to add a function for simulated experiment assessment. The conversation also touches on the possibility of including chemistry experiments in the future. The designer's approach aligns with participatory design principles, as they actively seek user input and feedback. The conversation also highlights the importance of user-centered design in human-computer interaction.

13. User-4234; agreement; circuit diagrams; old style

Summary: The designer continues to share updates about the software, focusing on electricity and mechanics. They plan to add a function for simulated experiment assessment and seek user feedback on this feature. The designer also expresses a personal interest in chemistry and the possibility of including chemistry experiments in the future. The conversation highlights the designer's commitment to participatory design, as they actively seek user input and feedback. The designer also consults the group about the type of intersection used in circuit diagrams in current textbooks.

Notes: The designer's approach to software development aligns with principles of participatory design and user-centered design. The conversation also highlights the importance of balancing completeness with usability in software development. The designer's focus on electricity and mechanics reflects the focus of physics education in schools. The potential inclusion of chemistry experiments could broaden the software's appeal and educational value.

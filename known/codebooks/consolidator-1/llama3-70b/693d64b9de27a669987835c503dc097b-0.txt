You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* community development
* design principles
* infrastructure challenges
* knowledge acquisition strategies
* learning design
* physics lab features
* scientific inquiry
* support mechanisms
* technical development
* user technology interaction

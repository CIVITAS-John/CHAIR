You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

2.
Label: design flexibility
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

3.

15.
Label: iterative refinement
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

16.
Label: subject scope
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

Label: agreement
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.
- Designer: Hmm hmm.
- User: Indeed

18.
Label: future direction

Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

20.
Label: assessment functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

21.
Label: positive feedback
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

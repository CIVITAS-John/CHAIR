You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
Can you identify more categories for merging?
Yes, I can identify a few more categories that can be merged:
- "software development and updates" and "software features" can be merged into a single category "Software Development and Features"
- "professional background" and "software use" can be merged into a single category "User Background and Engagement"

Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
The category "Community Design and Engagement" could potentially be split into two separate categories: "Community Engagement" and "Community Design". This would allow for a more nuanced analysis of these related but distinct aspects.

Is any naming inaccurate?
The naming of the categories seems accurate and concise, covering the key aspects of the research question.

# Final Merging
* community engagement and interaction
* user-centered community design
=> Community Design and Engagement

* user assistance and guidance
* software development and updates
* software features
=> Software Development and Features

* professional background
* software use
=> User Background and Engagement

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (8 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
8. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P14: How do you say?
Preliminary tags: language barrier; communication
2. P14: [Image 299]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
3. P17: Brainiac.
Preliminary tags: user recognition; community interaction
4. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
Preliminary tags: user onboarding; platform exploration
5. P18: Just downloaded it.
Preliminary tags: user inquiry; feature usage
6. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10
Preliminary tags: resource sharing; external link dissemination
7. P6: When will it be updated?
8. P20: Why does that fuse keep burning out?

Thoughts: In analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, consider how users navigate the platform (user onboarding, platform exploration), interact with each other (user recognition, community interaction), share resources (image sharing, external link dissemination), and communicate (language barrier, communication). Additionally, explore how users inquire about features and updates, which can provide insights into their learning processes and engagement with the platform.

Tags for each message:
1. language barrier; communication; user inquiry
2. image sharing; resource sharing
3. user recognition; community interaction
4. user onboarding; platform exploration; user inquiry
5. user inquiry; feature usage
6. resource sharing; external link dissemination
7. platform exploration; updates inquiry
8. troubleshooting; technical support; user inquiry

Summary: The conversation includes discussions on language barriers, image and resource sharing, user recognition, community interaction, user onboarding, platform exploration, feature usage, external link dissemination, updates inquiry, troubleshooting, and technical support.

Notes: The users seem actively engaged in exploring and utilizing the platform, seeking help and resources from each other, and inquiring about features and updates. The community interaction and user recognition aspects suggest a growing sense of belonging and collaboration within the Physics Lab online community.

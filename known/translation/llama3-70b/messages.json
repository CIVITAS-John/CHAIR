Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).\n\n# Component Property Adjustments\nDry batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources. Incandescent bulbs now have voltage and current characteristics and are no longer ideal resistors. The resistor law experiment device now uses real formulas for calculation, with adjustable parameters. Hid connectors 3 and 4.\n\n# Bug Fixes\nFixed the issue of unit conversion when editing properties in the Editor. The wire arrow no longer displays a jumping animation.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: emphasizing refinement, suggesting refinement over completeness
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both convey a focus on refinement as a priority over other aspects (completeness).
Criteria: A user or person prioritizes refinement and suggests iterating to achieve it.
Phrase: Prioritizing refinement over completeness.

2.
Concepts: emphasizing quality, striving for quality
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both convey a desire to improve the quality of something (auto-generated content).
Criteria: A designer stresses the importance of quality and aims to enhance it.
Phrase: Striving for quality improvement.

3.
Concepts: design values, aligning with design philosophy
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both convey a sense of adherence to a guiding principle or set of principles (design philosophy).
Criteria: A user shares or adheres to the underlying principles or values of the design.
Phrase: Adhering to design values.

4.
Concepts: emphasize quality, demonstrating commitment to accuracy
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both convey a commitment to achieving high-quality results (accuracy).
Criteria: A designer stresses the importance of quality and demonstrates a commitment to achieving it.
Phrase: Demonstrating commitment to quality.

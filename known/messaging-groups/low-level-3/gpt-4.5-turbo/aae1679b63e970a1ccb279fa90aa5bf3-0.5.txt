You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Summary: The conversation revolves around the designer's interaction with the community members regarding updates and features of the Physics Lab application. The designer shares update schedules, responds to user inquiries, and provides technical guidance on using new features. This dialogue illustrates an active participatory design process where user feedback directly influences development decisions. It also highlights the community's role in shaping the software through continuous interaction and engagement.

Notes: Observing the dynamics of user-designer interaction could provide deeper insights into how user feedback is integrated into software development. The community's engagement level and the designer's responsiveness are crucial for fostering a collaborative environment. Further analysis could explore specific interactions that lead to changes in the software, providing a clearer picture of participatory design in action.

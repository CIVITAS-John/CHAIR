You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: code review, debugging and fixing ai-generated code
- Instances where the participant reviews and debugs AI-generated code.
- Participants identify errors, debug, and manually fix errors in AI-generated code.

2.
Concepts: highlights iterative improvement, using ai for code optimization and assistance
- Instances where the participant uses AI to improve or optimize their code.
- Participants use AI to optimize code and improve performance.

3.
Concepts: values time saving, describing time-saving benefits
- Participants value time-saving benefits of AI assistance.
- Participants perceive and describe the time-saving benefits of using LLM-driven interfaces.

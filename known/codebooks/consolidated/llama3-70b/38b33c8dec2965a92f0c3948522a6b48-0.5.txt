You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: resource sharing appreciation, resource sharing and collaboration
Relationship: Inclusion (resource sharing appreciation is a result of resource sharing and collaboration)
Criteria: Users share resources and collaborate, leading to appreciation for the shared resources.
Label: Collaborative Resource Sharing

2.
Concepts: consideration, usability consideration
Relationship: Parallel (consideration and usability consideration are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Designers prioritize user needs and experiences in their design decisions.
Label: User-Centered Design

3.
Concepts: building trust, building rapport
Relationship: Intersection (building trust and building rapport are interconnected concepts)
Criteria: Designers establish a connection with users through conversation, shared experiences, or emojis, leading to trust and credibility.
Label: Building Relationships

4.
Concepts: seeking requirements, trying to understand the needs
Relationship: Parallel (seeking requirements and trying to understand the needs are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Designers and users engage in a dialogue to gather information about user needs and requirements.
Label: Needs Discovery

5.
Concepts: feature clarification
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Designers provide explanations or information about software features or functionality.
Label: Feature Explanation

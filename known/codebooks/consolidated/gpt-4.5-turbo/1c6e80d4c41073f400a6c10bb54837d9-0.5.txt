You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging? Yes, further merging can be considered if the context overlaps significantly, such as merging "User and Social Interactions" with "Communication Strategies" because both involve interaction dynamics.
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split? The category "Community and Platform Foundations" might be too broad as it combines very distinct aspects like platform development and community identity. This may need revisiting.
- Is any naming inaccurate? The naming seems appropriate, but "Community and Platform Foundations" could be split or renamed to better reflect its diverse content.

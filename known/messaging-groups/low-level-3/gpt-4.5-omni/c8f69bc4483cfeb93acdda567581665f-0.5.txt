You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. P4232: Thank you.
Preliminary tags: gratitude; community interaction; user support; social bonding
2. P8: You're welcome. If you encounter any problems during use, you can directly discuss them in the group.
Preliminary tags: community support; problem solving; user guidance; group discussion
3. P4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to do everything and ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary tags: positive feedback; user satisfaction; software usability; comparative assessment
4. Designer: I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary tags: future consideration; technical planning; system compatibility; developer response
5. Designer: In theory, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from around 2008 onwards).
Preliminary tags: theoretical compatibility; system requirements; user guidance; technical detail
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been uploaded to the group files, with the following updates:
Preliminary tags: new release; version update; community announcement; software enhancement
7. Designer: # New Features
Electronic components will now be damaged after a brief process, rather than immediately. 
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface. 
Support for undoing wire and component creation and deletion. 
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current. 
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.
8. P4232: Suggest adding an exit button function for the PC version, as many regions now use all-in-one touchscreens without a physical keyboard.
9. Designer: Hmm... I'll add that in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, there might be another round this weekend.
10. P8: In that case, shouldn't a virtual keyboard be added to every input field?
11. Designer: Touchscreens already have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input field, probably like that.
13. Designer: I tried it in junior high last time, now there's a clever way to do it, just click the link button on the top right, after the browser pops up, it won't be in full screen anymore... = =
14. P4232: @Designer Yes, that's right.
15. P4232: If there could be an export function, or save and import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set the parameters in the office and import them directly in class.
16. Designer: It will be available.
17. Designer: Is there a network in the classroom?
18. P4232: Generally not, since one time during a city-level open class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 41].

1. P4232: I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
2. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available on the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
3. Designer: Sorry for the midnight crowing :)
4. P4233: How to download?
5. P4233: May I ask?
6. P8: Group sharing.
7. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Preliminary tags: payment difficulty; user experience; financial constraint
2. P11: It can also be adapted to 3D touch
Preliminary tags: 3d touch; feature adaptation; innovative design
3. Designer: Just charge directly through the app store?
Preliminary tags: payment processing; app store; business model
4. P14: Feels a bit troublesome
5. P2: ……
6. Designer: Now you can do it with just a fingerprint on the app store
7. P14: After all, just a middle school kid
8. Designer: That's true
9. Designer: Then just click on ads hh
10. P14: That's doable
11. P2: What's wrong with middle school [Emoji 1-268]
12. P2: Even a middle schooler is better than you
13. P11: Just hope the ads don't take up too much of the experiment interface
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
15. P11: He means he doesn't have a good payment method in middle school
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
19. Designer: Just let you click on ads to earn points, and use points to unlock new content
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can follow the network cable to hit me
21. P2: I can program
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 1-280]
24. Designer: Permanent ad banners on iOS are really disgusting
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen is not big and has psoriasis.
27. P2: And it forces you to click.
28. P2: What are the ads used for @Designer 
29. Designer: Health preservation...
30. Designer: Doing this requires nurturing people...
31. P1: It's not free.
32. Designer: Actually, it's the same as charging money, except you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay.
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do a bit more.
35. Designer: There are some other ways.

Thoughts: 
In this conversation, I plan to explore how the Physics Lab's online community emerged through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will examine how the designer and participants interact, negotiate, and co-create the online community. I will also investigate how the participants' experiences, concerns, and suggestions shape the development of Physics Lab. Guiding questions include: How do the participants perceive the payment system and its impact on their experience? How does the designer respond to participants' concerns and suggestions? What are the underlying values and assumptions that influence the design of Physics Lab?

Summary:
This conversation revolves around the payment system and user experience in Physics Lab. The participants discuss the difficulties of payment, the possibility of adapting to 3D touch, and the concerns about advertising. The designer responds to participants' concerns, explaining the reasoning behind the payment system and the potential for alternative solutions. The conversation also touches on the participants' demographics, technical skills, and interactions with each other.

Notes:
It appears that the payment system is a significant concern for the participants, and the designer is actively engaging with their concerns. The conversation highlights the importance of user experience and the need for adaptable design. The participants' interactions with each other reveal a sense of community and playfulness, which may be an essential aspect of the Physics Lab's online community.

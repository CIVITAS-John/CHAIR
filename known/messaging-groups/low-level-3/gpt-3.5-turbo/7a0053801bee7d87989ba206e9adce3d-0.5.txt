You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P8: [Image 0]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
Preliminary tags: user needs; watermark removal; community interaction
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
Preliminary tags: platform version; compatibility
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary tags: image uploading demonstration; user role clarification; educational context
5. P4229: Yes.
Preliminary tags: teaching role; community roles
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are in the group announcement.
7. Designer: Feel free to share any suggestions and needs.
8. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
9. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
10. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
13. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.

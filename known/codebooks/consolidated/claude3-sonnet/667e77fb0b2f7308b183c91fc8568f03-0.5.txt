You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

~~~
1. active learning, learning support features.
- Aspects of the software that encourage active learning, experimentation, or hands-on engagement with physics concepts.
- Software features or affordances that facilitate conceptual understanding, visualization, or simulation of physics concepts.

2. software updates, component update, sharing updates.
- Mentions of new software versions, releases, or planned features and updates.
- Information or announcements about updates or changes to software components or functionality.
- Instances where developers or designers share information about upcoming updates or changes to the software.

3. feature planning, feature prioritization.
- Discussions around planned software features and capabilities.
- Discussions or decisions related to prioritizing the development or implementation of certain features or sections.

4. emoji usage, image sharing.
- Instances where participants use emojis in their communication, potentially indicating shared norms or practices within the community.
- Instances where participants share images or screenshots, potentially indicating shared norms or practices within the community.

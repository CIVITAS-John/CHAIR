You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: providing context for design constraints, communicating design limitations
- Providing context for design constraints or limitations.
- Designers explain or justify design limitations or constraints, and directly communicate technical limitations or constraints.

2.
Concepts: outlining future design plans, planning feature and software development
- A designer or user outlines future design plans or directions, listing tasks or features that need to be addressed.
- Designer plans or outlines feature development, and plans or discusses improvements or new features for the software.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: providing context for design constraints, communicating design limitations
Relationship: The concepts are closely related as providing context for design constraints is a way of communicating design limitations.
Criteria: Designers explain or justify design limitations or constraints, and directly communicate technical limitations or constraints.
Phrase: Clarifying design constraints

2.
Concepts: outlining future design plans, planning feature and software development
Relationship: The concepts are closely related as outlining future design plans involves planning feature and software development.
Criteria: Designers or users outline future design plans or directions, listing tasks or features that need to be addressed, and plan or discuss improvements or new features for the software.
Phrase: Envisioning future development

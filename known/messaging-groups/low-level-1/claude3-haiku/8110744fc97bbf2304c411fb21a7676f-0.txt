You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1. Designer: I guess it's because the teacher finds it annoying when people talk too much.233
2. P1: hello
3. P4: [Image]
4. P5: 233 By the way, let's see if there are any good designs to learn from.
5. Designer: Good design?
6. P6: Like a microcomputer.
7. Designer: Let's talk about logic gates.
8. P2: The CPU of a computer is made up of logic gates.
9. P5: Hmm.
10. P5: I need logic gates for making a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
11. P6: [Image]
12. P6: [Image]
13. P7: How to play?
14. Designer: Play by conducting experiments.233
15. P8: Why suddenly add a wave?

1. design, teacher, talking
2. greeting
3. image
4. design, learning
5. design
6. microcomputer
7. logic gates
8. CPU, logic gates
9. hmm
10. logic gates, calculator, Minecraft
11. image
12. image
13. playing
14. experiment
15. wave

Summary: The conversation covers various topics related to physics, computer science, and design. The participants discuss concepts like logic gates, CPUs, and calculators, and share images and ideas. There are also some social interactions, such as greetings and questions about playing or experimenting.

Notes: The conversation seems to be focused on technical topics, but there are also some social interactions. The participants are sharing information and ideas, and there is a sense of collaboration and exploration. The conversation could provide insights into how the online community at Physics Lab emerged and how the participants engaged with each other around technical topics.

1.
Label: suggests system support
Quotes:
- E01: Depending on what you do and how busy you are and the higher ranking people are, the more busy they are, the longer it is between sessions. So you make some notes on little yellow, sticky cinnamon. And then you go back to your administrator job for two months, and then some other project comes up. And then six months later, you come back. Okay, now, where was I? (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on how professionals learn - they learn in fragments, in fragmented time blocks and need support from the system to remind them where they were.

6.
Label: highlight the importance of feedback loops
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

11.
Label: describes iterative debugging process
Quotes:
- E01: I have I found with with playing with with ChatGPT. And I was something at Python, I think I tried to give it the code. And I tried to run it generated error. And then I would go back to the next prompt and ChatGPT. And I go, that code is good. But it generates the following error. And I list the error online on this line, and I'd quote the line. And I say, Can you fix that?  (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug in the generated code, he refers to his previous practice with asking ChatGPT to debug with the code, the error message, and the line number. Interviewer did what E01 said.

16.
Label: discuss need for customized documentation
Quotes:
- E01: And you want doctors to use it, nurses to use it and medical transcriptionists to use it. They use a different word for whatever the verb for whatever it is you're saying you want them to do. And so, in some sense, their documentation has to be customized to their context to their user group. ... It's a language system. If you have a learning system that's actually capable of harvesting information, yeah, and a lot of them are not yet, but I think we'll get there. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to translate jargons between different sub-groups working in the same systems and ease the cost of writing customized documentation.

(interviewer's observation) To maximize the capability of ChatGPT, one needs to know how to iteratively ask questions.

19.
Label: reflects on integrating user feedback into ai
Quotes:
- E01: I call it hive feedback system, where if anyone in the world learns a new fact, or like, Oh, if you're a nurse, here's the word. If you're a transcriptionist, here's the word. If anybody learns it, then it goes into the system into the cloud. And now the cloud won't make that mistake anymore. And then the developer doesn't have to solve all these problems, because all the users solve their own problems. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how the human-AI collaborative system could be used to increase general productivity.

20.
Label: values non ruthless model creation
Quotes:
- E04: It's basically following best practices. It is not trying to ruthlessly create a model. (interviewer's observation) Not "ruthlessly create a model".

21.
Label: viable & efficient
Quotes:

22.
Label: suggests need for better novice support
Quotes:
- E01: I couldn't (help the novice) because when a beginner just posts a big block of code, it says there's something wrong with this. (interviewer's observation) Challenges for novices to seek help: they simply post chunks of code without background information.

- E04: "I want to create a simple perception" (interviewer's observation) Thinks a bit about whether to use "in NetLogo" or not.

25.
Label: human-ai (positive)
Quotes:
- E01: So if I'm writing long NetLogo code now, I'd probably have ChatGPT just open on the side. And I write a block of code and then I handed ChatGPT. Say, could I have done this better? And it would go, yeah, you could rearrange this like that. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could help E01 optimize his code.
- E01: I want to do this in visual basic... So I made a spreadsheet and I asked ChatGPT, how do you do this? And it wrote the code and the code worked out of the box. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT helped with a VBA task out of the box before.
- E01: Well, I cut the entire user's question. It figured out what I wanted. I didn't even tell it what I wanted. It just told me. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could infer E01's need from the input context.

26.
Label: reflects on design suitability for experts
Quotes:
- E04: Part of the issue that I'm having now is just kind of like the learning curve, just trying to figure out how everything works. (interviewer's observation) E04 mentions a learning curve, likely because our current design is not fine-tuned for experts.

27.
Label: calls for conceptual error detection
Quotes:
- E01: So I see this from beginners all the time is they, they just get totally lost. I call it lint program from Unix, you know, it's like it's a little green checkbox looks at you and go, okay, wait, it's just, you've spelled everything correctly, but you have a conceptual error here. If it, if it caught structural problems like that, that would, that would help. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo needs to have linting features that exist in other languages (we are working on that right now). Here, E01 wants the linting to support identifying conceptual mistakes, different from syntax mistakes which most linters work on.

28.
Label: acknowledges improvements in error handling
Quotes:
- E04: It was really nice that it, like with the troubleshooting errors, for example, like at least in principle, I know that we had this one that we couldn't fix.

29.
Label: emphasize need for interaction with external systems
Quotes:
- E01: And some of them we still haven't been doing like hive mind, like how we are going to have the machine learning back from the user feedback or just from the compiler, right? You generate some code, but it doesn't work. So we have to tell you that this time, you didn't work. (interviewer's observation) The current ChatGPT implementation cannot check the generated code with external information (compiler, etc.) (partially solved by the Interpreter plugin, but only Python at this time)

30.
Label: appreciates flexibility in coding conventions
Quotes:
- E01: That's okay. Go is a convention. It's not really a requirement of the language that you use the word go. You can say banana to banana and have a button on the interface. It's a banana button. (interviewer's observation) E01 honors ChatGPT's own intuition even though it might be different from the convention.

31.
Label: wants to learn gis extensions
Quotes:
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time.

32.
Label: novice (negative)
Quotes:
- E01: In terms of learning experiences, like ramping up to using an assistant wrapping up to using ChatGPT might have some sort of evaluates. How well can you write instructions for another person? Some people just don't know how to conceptualize a problem. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how "writing instructions" is a capability that is missing on many people, and that is key to work with AI.

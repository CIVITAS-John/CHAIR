You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...

9. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary tags: feature request; mechanical waves; optical experiments; user needs
2. Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary tags: development prioritization; electrical section; magnetism
3. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: user feedback; opinion gathering; participatory design
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; community gratitude
5. P4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary tags: pc version inquiry; interactive whiteboard; user request
6. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary tags: group files; resource access; user satisfaction
7. Designer: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: Analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, I'll consider the learning sciences perspective to identify how users are engaging with the Physics Lab online community, the human-computer interaction perspective to examine how users are interacting with the platform, and the participatory design perspective to understand how the designer is involving users in the design process. I'll also explore how the community is emerging through user requests, feedback, and appreciation.

Tags for each message:
1. feature request; mechanical waves; optical experiments; user needs; community engagement
2. development prioritization; electrical section; magnetism; project planning
3. user feedback; opinion gathering; participatory design; community involvement
4. appreciation; community gratitude; social norms
5. pc version inquiry; interactive whiteboard; user request; platform accessibility
6. group files; resource access; user satisfaction; community resources
7. image sharing; community building; (no text, so tags are speculative)
8. update announcement; component simulation; design iteration
9. component update; ideal components; simulation features

Summary: The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community, where users are requesting features and providing feedback to the designer. The designer is prioritizing development tasks, gathering opinions, and involving users in the design process. Users are appreciative of the designer's efforts and are accessing community resources.

Notes: The conversation suggests that the Physics Lab online community is emerging through user engagement, feedback, and participation in the design process. The designer is actively involving users in the development process, which may foster a sense of community and ownership. The conversation also highlights the importance of understanding user needs and priorities in the development process.

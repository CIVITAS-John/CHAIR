1. 你们有学过天文吗
---
2. 没有
---
3. 你是指比例间距？@2
---
4. 抱歉没有呢，天文学普及还仅限于北京
---
5. 卧槽
---
6. 不是好嘛
---
7. 这是正确的
---
8. 强
---
9. 水金地火木土

10. 请过目
---
11. 哦
---
12. 那月球呢？
---
13. 绕地球转着
---
14. 我说的是软件里的
---
15. 那问一下群主吧
---
16. 火星在地球外面啊
---
17. 啥问题。。
---
18. 月球呢
---
19. 月球没画吧
---
20. 可能还没有做
---
21. 上次来不及
---
22. 月球这个东西没用啊
---
23. 要取决于比例尺
---
24. 谁说的
---
25. 会有多个预设的
---
26. 因为实际你碰到题目也多种可能，很多题都是近地空间站
---
27. 是的
---
28. 人造卫星轨道
---
29. 这些会更多涉及
---
30. 双星系统，虽然这个估计平时不会碰到。。
---
31. 谁知道引力波整么测的
---
32. john你更安卓了么
---
33. 没，今天更一下
---
34. 太空我买一个去
---
35. 是星空
---
36. 你别给模仿得一模一样了
---
37. steam上面也有模仿天体的软件
---
38. 78还是79记不清楚了
---
39. 贫穷限制了我的记忆
---
40. 去网上了解一下吧，这不是三言两语能解决的@2
---
41. 能加入马达吗@3
---
42. 我觉得我应该安分的去搞数学
---
43. 会，但别急
---
44. 我们会比较简单，比较实用（贴近考试），比较便宜
---
45. 嗯问下群主
---
46. 毕竟不是专门做天文
---
47. 天文专门软件够好了
---
48. 目前我知道的
---
49. Physics Lab里实验结果是怎么得到的
---
50. 电机模拟比较麻烦，和负载有关
---
51. 算出来的。。
---
52. 整么算
---
53. 好的
---
54. 因为上次那个整流器，让我浅显地以为是预设了模型
---
55. 也可以理解为预设模型，不过是原子化的模型
---
56. 追求精度手机算不动
---
57. 服务器？
---
58. 哈哈哈哈
---
59. 单机的
---
60. 如果让马达接交流电呢
---
61. 两种马达了
---
62. 你上服务器呢
---
63. 有刷马达
---
64. 不是接交流的无刷电机
===

1. Have you ever studied astronomy?
---
2. No.
---
3. Are you referring to the proportional distance? @2
---
4. Sorry, no. Astronomy education is still limited to Beijing.
---
5. Damn.
---
6. Isn't it good?
---
7. This is correct.
---
8. Strong.
---
9. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.
---
10. Please take a look.
---
11. Oh.
---
12. What about the moon?
---
13. It orbits the Earth.
---
14. I mean in the software.
---
15. Then ask the group owner.
---
16. Mars is outside of Earth.
---
17. What’s the problem...
---
18. The moon?
---
19. The moon isn't drawn, right?
---
20. Maybe it hasn't been made yet.
---
21. Last time there wasn't enough time.
---
22. The moon is useless.
---
23. It depends on the scale.
---
24. Who said that?
---
25. There will be multiple presets.
---
26. Because in reality, you encounter various possibilities, and many questions are about near-Earth space stations.
---
27. Yes.
---
28. Artificial satellite orbits.
---
29. These will be more involved.
---
30. Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter this often...
---
31. Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
---
32. John, have you updated Android?
---
33. No, I'll update it today.
---
34. I'll buy one for space.
---
35. It's the starry sky.
---
36. Don't imitate it exactly.
---
37. There is also software on Steam that simulates celestial bodies.
---
38. 78 or 79, I can't remember.
---
39. Poverty limits my memory.
---
40. Check it out online, this can't be explained in a few words. @2
---
41. Can a motor be added? @3
---
42. I think I should stick to doing math.
---
43. Yes, but don't rush.
---
44. Ours will be simpler, more practical (closer to exams), and cheaper.
---
45. Hmm, ask the group owner.
---
46. After all, it's not specifically for astronomy.
---
47. Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
---
48. As far as I know.
---
49. How are the experimental results obtained in Physics Lab?
---
50. Motor simulation is quite complicated and related to the load.
---
51. Calculated...
---
52. How is it calculated?
---
53. Okay.
---
54. Because of that rectifier last time, I naively thought it was a preset model.
---
55. It can also be understood as a preset model, but it's an atomized model.
---
56. Pursuing precision, a phone can't handle the calculations.
---
57. Server?
---
58. Hahaha.
---
59. Standalone.
---
60. What if the motor is connected to AC power?
---
61. Two types of motors.
---
62. Are you on the server?
---
63. There are brush motors.
---
64. Not brushless motors connected to AC power.

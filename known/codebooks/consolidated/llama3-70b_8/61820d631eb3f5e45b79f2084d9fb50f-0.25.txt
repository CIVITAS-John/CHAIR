You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: engage in conversation with ai, engaging with ai using natural language
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the interaction between participants and AI, with the first concept focusing on the conversational aspect and the second concept highlighting the use of natural language.
Criteria: Participants engage in conversation with AI using natural language.
Phrase: Interacting with AI naturally.

2.
Concepts: seeks error-free code, seeks ai code optimization
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the participant's desire for AI assistance in improving their code, with the first concept focusing on error-free code and the second concept highlighting optimization and debugging.
Criteria: Participants seek AI assistance to produce error-free and optimized code.
Phrase: Seeking AI code refinement.

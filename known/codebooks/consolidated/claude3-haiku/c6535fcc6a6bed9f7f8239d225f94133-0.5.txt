You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}

1. designer's role and feedback integration, feedback mechanisms.
- Statements that describe the designer's efforts to incorporate user feedback and enhance the software's educational features.
- Mechanisms within the software that provide students with immediate feedback on their actions and understanding. The designers actively seek feedback and input from the community members to inform the design of the simulated electricity experiment assessment feature.

2. designer openness, responsiveness.
- Discussions about the designer's responsiveness to the teacher's needs and suggestions, as well as the designer's openness to feedback from the community.
- Discussions that demonstrate the responsiveness of the designers or developers to user feedback and needs, as well as the designer's openness to suggestions and feedback from the community.

3. platform updates, design updates and development process.
- The designer's communication about upcoming changes and improvements to the platform.
- Statements that describe the software updates, changes, or improvements, as well as discussions that provide information about the development process.

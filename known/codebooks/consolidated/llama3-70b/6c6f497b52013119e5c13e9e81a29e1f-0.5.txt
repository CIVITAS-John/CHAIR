You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
2. {Repeat the input 2}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 2}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 2}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 2}

~~~
1. introductions, user introductions
- Users or designers introducing themselves or sharing their background.
- Users share their professional background to establish credibility and context

2. user consultation, designer-user interaction
- Instances where designers consult users (teachers, students) for input or feedback on design decisions.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1. introductions, user introductions
Relationship: Inclusive (introductions include sharing professional background)
Criteria: Users or designers share information about themselves, including their professional background, to establish credibility and context.
Label: Self-Introduction

2. user consultation, designer-user interaction
Relationship: Parallel (consultation and interaction are two aspects of the same concept)
Criteria: Designers engage with users (teachers, students) to gather feedback, provide solutions, or involve them in design decisions.
Label: Collaborative Design

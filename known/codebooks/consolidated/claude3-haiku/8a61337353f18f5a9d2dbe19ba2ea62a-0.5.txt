You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

Categories:
* Learning Experience
* Experiential Learning

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1. Learning Experience and Experiential Learning
Relationship: The concepts of "learning experience" and "experiential learning" are closely related, as the former refers to the overall experience of learning, while the latter specifically focuses on the active, hands-on engagement of learners.
Criteria: This code captures how the development of the Physics Lab software and its features enabled students to actively engage in hands-on experiments and exploration of physics concepts, thereby shaping their overall learning experience.
Label: Learning Experience and Experiential Learning
Category: Learner Engagement

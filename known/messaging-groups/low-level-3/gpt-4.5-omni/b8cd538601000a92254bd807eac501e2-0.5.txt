You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. P4230: First, let's pay tribute to the experts, then I have a small request. Can you make a dynamic demonstration of mechanical wave and mechanical vibration, such as the propagation of transverse waves and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, I really hope to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, polarizers, etc., to demonstrate optical experiments~
Preliminary tags: expert recognition; feature request; instructional tools; user needs
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing the electricity section first, then move on to magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary tags: development prioritization; project management; feature planning; user feedback consideration
3. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember.
Preliminary tags: feedback gathering; project timeline; user involvement; memory aid
4. P4230: Okay okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; user acknowledgment; community support; gratitude
5. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
Preliminary tags: emoji use; greeting; platform inquiry; interactive tools
6. P4231: I saw the files in the group, thank you.
Preliminary tags: resource discovery; gratitude; user acknowledgment; self sufficiency
7. Designer: [Image 14]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.

Summary: The conversation started with P4230 acknowledging the expertise of the designer and requesting specific features for demonstrating mechanical and optical experiments. The designer responded by outlining the current development priorities, focusing on completing the electricity and magnetism sections before tackling mechanics. The designer also emphasized the importance of gathering user feedback before starting new sections. P4230 expressed gratitude for the designer's efforts. P4231 joined the conversation, inquiring about downloading the Physics Lab for PC or interactive whiteboards and later found the necessary files, expressing thanks. The designer shared an image and provided updates on the upcoming changes to the dry batteries and student power supply components, highlighting improvements in component realism and functionality.

Notes: The community plays a crucial role in providing feedback and shaping the development priorities of Physics Lab. The designer actively engages with users, considers their requests, and communicates planned updates. The iterative design process is evident, with the designer emphasizing the need to gather opinions before starting new sections. The use of emojis and images indicates a visually engaging and supportive community environment. Future analysis could explore how specific user feedback influences design decisions and how the community's needs evolve over time.

Summary of the conversation until now: This conversation involves members of the Physics Lab online community sharing information, resources (images/multimedia), and knowledge related to physics and astronomy. There are instances of asking and answering questions, expressing agreement/disagreement, confusion, admiration, and casual conversation. Members engage with each other's posts, mention each other, and have polite exchanges.
1. P2: I'm talking about the software.
2. P11: Then ask the group owner.
3. Designer: Mars is outside the Earth.
4. Designer: What's the problem?
5. P4: No problem.
6. P2: What about the moon?
7. P1: The moon is not drawn, right?
8. P14: Maybe it hasn't been done yet.
9. P14: 
10. Designer: Last time it was too rushed.
11. P4: The moon is useless.
12. P4: 2333
13. Designer: It depends on the scale.
14. P2: Who said that?
15. P4: universe sandbox
16. Designer: There will be multiple presets.
17. Designer: Because in reality, you encounter many possible questions, many of which are about near-Earth space stations.
18. P11: Yes.
19. Designer: Artificial satellite orbits.
20. Designer: These will involve more.
21. Designer: Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter this normally...
22. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
23. P1: John, have you become more Android?
24. Designer: No, I'll update it today.
25. P17: [Image]
26. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
27. Designer: I'll buy a ticket to space.
28. P17: It's the starry sky.
29. P1: Don't imitate it exactly the same.
30. P14: There are also software imitating celestial bodies on Steam.

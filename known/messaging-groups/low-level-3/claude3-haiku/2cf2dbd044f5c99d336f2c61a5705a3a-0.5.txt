Summary of previous conversation: The conversation has evolved from an initial suggestion about searching on Baidu to a more in-depth discussion about the design and development of the Physics Lab software, as well as broader topics related to astronomy and space exploration. Participants have engaged with each other, sharing information, seeking clarification, and reacting to various contributions. The discussion has touched on themes such as the need for presets, handling different types of space-related questions, the representation of celestial bodies, and the potential for additional features like motors. The community members have also shared relevant media, such as images, and have acknowledged limitations in their own knowledge or memory. Overall, the conversation demonstrates an active and engaged online community exploring the various aspects of the Physics Lab software and its broader context.
1. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
Preliminary tags: community participation; memory; limitations

Preliminary tags: community participation; referral
3. P2: Can a motor be added?
Preliminary tags: software design; motor integration
4. P14: I think I should focus on studying mathematics.
5. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
6. Designer: We will be simpler, more practical (closer to exams), and cheaper.
7. P11: ðŸ˜‚
8. P11: Ask the group owner.
9. Designer: After all, we are not specialized in astronomy.
10. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
11. P2: [Image 144]
12. P2: From what I know currently.
13. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in the Physics Lab?
14. Designer: Motor simulation is more complicated, and it depends on the load.
15. Designer: Calculated...
16. P2: How to calculate it?
17. P11: Okay.
18. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
19. P11: [Image 152]
20. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but it is an atomic model.
21. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
22. P1: Server?
23. P11: Hahaha.
24. Designer: Standalone.
25. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
26. Designer: Two types of motors.
27. P1: Are you on the server?
28. P2: Brushed motor.
29. P2: Brushless motors are not connected to AC.
30. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
31. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
32. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
33. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple to follow the method I mentioned @Designer 
34. P14: [Image 168]
35. P2: What if it burns?

Thoughts: The conversation has shifted to a more technical discussion around the design and implementation of the Physics Lab software, particularly focusing on the integration of motors and the challenges involved. Participants are exploring different types of motors, their characteristics, and the feasibility of incorporating them into the software. The discussion also touches on topics related to accuracy, computational limitations, and the need for specialized astronomy software. To analyze this conversation, I will draw on theories and frameworks from learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to understand the emergence and dynamics of this online community.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

Thoughts: When analyzing the conversation, consider how members engage in practical applications, project-based learning, and inquiry-based activities within the community. Look at how the designer guides community activities and encourages an experimental approach. Also, explore how members share images, question community activities, reflect on engagement, and provide brief responses.

Tags for each message:
1. practical application; project-based learning; logic gates; calculator; Minecraft alternative
2. image sharing; visual content
3. image sharing; visual content
4. inquiry-based learning; learning engagement; gameplay
5. guidance on community activities; experimental approach; conducting experiments
6. questioning community activities; engagement reflection; wave addition
7. acknowledgment; brief response
8. image sharing; visual content
9. image sharing; visual content
10. brief response

Summary: The conversation includes discussions on practical applications like using logic gates for a calculator, project-based learning, and inquiry-based learning through gameplay. The designer provides guidance on community activities and encourages an experimental approach. Members engage in image sharing, question community activities, reflect on engagement, and provide brief responses.

Notes: The community seems actively involved in practical and project-based learning activities, with the designer playing a role in guiding these experiences. Image sharing is a common form of communication, and members are curious, reflective, and responsive within the community interactions.

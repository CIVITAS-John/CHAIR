You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate verb phrase as label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated verb phrase of code 1}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1. 
Concepts: seeking clarification
Relationship: Inclusion (seeking clarification includes asking a question or seeking confirmation)
Criteria: A user or designer asks a question or seeks confirmation about a specific issue to gain a better understanding.
Label: Seeking Clarification

2. 
Concepts: sharing experiences
Relationship: Parallel (two aspects of sharing experiences: teaching experience and software experience)
Criteria: A user shares information about their teaching experience or tenure, or describes their experience using the software in a classroom setting.
Label: Sharing Experiences

3. 
Concepts: express gratitude
Relationship: Inclusion (expressing gratitude includes appreciation for the software or the community)
Criteria: A user expresses gratitude or appreciation for the Physics Lab software, the designer's efforts, or the community.
Label: Expressing Gratitude

4. 
Concepts: acknowledging limitations
Relationship: Inclusion (acknowledging limitations includes constraints in development, community, or software)
Criteria: A user or designer acknowledges limitations or constraints that affect the development or community, or limitations in the software.
Label: Acknowledging Limitations

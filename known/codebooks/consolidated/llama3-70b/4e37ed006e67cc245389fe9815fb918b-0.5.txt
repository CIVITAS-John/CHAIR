You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: user feedback commitment, attentiveness and improvement acknowledgement
- Designers commit to implementing user-suggested improvements or features, and promise to consider user suggestions or feedback.
- Designers acknowledge user comments or feedback, acknowledging areas for potential improvement.

2.
Concepts: feature complexity comparison, weighing trade-offs and balancing complexity and usability
- A designer compares or contrasts the complexity or difficulty of different features.
- Designer weighs the trade-offs of different options, and designer balances complexity with usability in development decisions.

3.
Concepts: user-centric design
- Designers prioritize user-centered development or convenience, emphasizing user experience and ease of use.
- Designers prioritize user needs and experiences in their design decisions.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: user feedback commitment, attentiveness and improvement acknowledgement
Relationship: Inclusion (acknowledgement is a part of commitment)
Criteria: Designers respond to user feedback by committing to implement changes and acknowledging areas for improvement.
Label: User Feedback Responsiveness

2.
Concepts: feature complexity comparison, weighing trade-offs and balancing complexity and usability
Relationship: Intersection (comparing complexity and weighing trade-offs are interconnected processes)
Criteria: Designers evaluate the complexity of different features and weigh the trade-offs to balance complexity with usability.
Label: Feature Complexity Evaluation

3.
Concepts: user-centric design
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Designers prioritize user needs, experiences, and convenience in their development decisions.
Label: User-Centric Design Approach

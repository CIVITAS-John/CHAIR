You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: prefers readable code
Quotes:
- E01: I don't want chat GPT to write 27 operations in one line and show how brilliant it is. I wanted to separate out the code and, and it did a good job of not only did it write the code, but it commented the code. And then in addition to commenting the code externally, it did documentation. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT tends to provide comments and documentation. Generated code is easy to read.

2.
Label: notes incomplete ai responses
Quotes:
- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

3.
Label: human (negative): time
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the, one of the things which I have observed, as I'm bouncing from like, because I do a lot of different languages and potentially, so I don't have that much time to spend in anyone. (interviewer's observation) As an expert, E01 knows many languages but does not have much time for each one.

4.
Label: initial task definition

- E01: So let's say "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square." (interviewer's observation) E01's first task.

5.
Label: suggests ai debugging
Quotes:
- E01: I have I found with with playing with with ChatGPT. And I was something at Python, I think I tried to give it the code. And I tried to run it generated error. And then I would go back to the next prompt and ChatGPT. And I go, that code is good. But it generates the following error. And I list the error online on this line, and I'd quote the line. And I say, Can you fix that?  (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug in the generated code, he refers to his previous practice with asking ChatGPT to debug with the code, the error message, and the line number. Interviewer did what E01 said.

6.
Label: appreciating ai's role in syntax explanation
Quotes:
- E04: I think that it's nice that it's, it clarifies error codes. I think that's probably where people who are new get stuck the most is trying to figure out the syntax and all the different errors. (interviewer's observation) The capability to clarify the errors.

7.
Label: criticizing ai output

9.
Label: interviewee reflecting on the need to iteratively ask questions to maximize chat gpt's capability
Quotes:
- E01: I've observed when I tried to suggest ChatGPT to other people, they're, um, they are amazed at the output that I can get.

Label: you know, so in point of fact, i considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can. so that when i come back to it later, i could figure out why it, why it's not working anymore
Quotes:

16.
Label: recognizing the importance of code testing
Quotes:

17.
Label: observing ai response variability
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that.

22.
Label: seeking assurance
Quotes:

24.
Label: highlighting the need for realistic understanding
Quotes:
- E01: And, and they don't, this is an unfamiliar task to them apparently. So they want to ask one question and get the right answer the first time. And I, I don't have that expectation. I'll ask the right question and it'll get me 80% of the way there. (interviewer's observation) Novices might have a too high expectation for ChatGPT (but it cannot achieve that).

25.
Label: need for human judgment
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

26.
Label: decides to copy and paste
Quotes:
- E04: Oh and you can run it. That's cool. (interviewer's observation) E04 reads the AI output and decides to copy & paste it although he could also run it.

27.

28.
Label: critiques improper help requests
Quotes:
- E01: if you approach the user group politely, graciously, and instead of dropping your entire code on it, you go, I narrowed it down to this. I read this documentation. I tried these eight things with this answer and I'm perplexed. If somebody goes, they paste their problem and it's clearly their homework and they want someone else to do it for them. No, I'm not going to help with that. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on proper practices to seek online help: do your own work and clearly describe what you need/tried.

29.
Label: recognizing key skills for ai interaction
Quotes:
- E01: In terms of learning experiences, like ramping up to using an assistant wrapping up to using ChatGPT might have some sort of evaluates. How well can you write instructions for another person? Some people just don't know how to conceptualize a problem. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how "writing instructions" is a capability that is missing on many people, and that is key to work with AI.

30.
Label: creating a simple neural network
Quotes:

31.
Label: integrating ai generated code
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) Again, he reads the code and selectively copies code to the model.

32.
Label: other ways
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.

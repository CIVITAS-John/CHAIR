You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

~~~
1.
Concepts: self-help, self answer
- Users resolve their own issues or find their own solutions.
- Answers or solutions provided by users themselves.

2.
Concepts: design inquiry, clarification and response
- Designer asks a design-related question, and provides answers or clarification in response.
- Designers seek clarification or confirmation, and respond to clarify previous questions or concerns.

3.
Concepts: positive feedback and encouragement
- Users or designers express praise, appreciation, or satisfaction with a product or service, or encourage feedback.
- User expresses satisfaction or appreciation for the software.

4.
Concepts: feature explanation
- Explanation or clarification of a feature's purpose.
- Explaining new features or functionality in the design.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: self-help, self answer
Relationship: Inclusion (self-answer is a type of self-help)
Criteria: Users independently resolve their own issues or find their own solutions without external help.
Label: Autonomous Problem-Solving

2.
Concepts: design inquiry, clarification and response
Relationship: Intersection (design inquiry leads to clarification and response)
Criteria: Designers ask questions, seek clarification, and respond to previous questions or concerns to improve design understanding.
Label: Collaborative Design Refining

3.
Concepts: positive feedback and encouragement
Relationship: Parallel (positive feedback and encouragement are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Users or designers express praise, appreciation, or satisfaction with a product or service, or encourage feedback to foster a positive community.
Label: Appreciative Feedback

4.
Concepts: feature explanation
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Explanations or clarifications are provided to help users understand a feature's purpose or new functionality in the design.
Label: Feature Elucidation

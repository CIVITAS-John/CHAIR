You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (8 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}
...
8.
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 8}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 8}

1.
Label: design roadmap
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

2.
Label: simulation updates
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

3.
Label: power supply
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
- Designer: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch

4.
Label: platform inquiry
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

5.
Label: technology access
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

6.
Label: resource appreciation
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

7.
Label: community sharing
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

8.
Label: group resources
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

Here are the refined codes with clear and generalizable criteria:

---
Definitions for each code:
1. 
Criteria: Designer discusses or outlines plans for the development or organization of Physics Lab.
Label: Design Planning
2. 
Criteria: Designer announces or explains changes or updates to simulation features or components.
Label: Simulation Updates
3. 
Criteria: Discussion about a specific type of power supply component in Physics Lab.
Label: Power Supply Component
4. 
Criteria: User asks about technical aspects or availability of Physics Lab.
Label: Platform Inquiry
5. 
Criteria: User asks about accessing Physics Lab on a specific device or platform.
Label: Technology Access
6. 
Criteria: User expresses gratitude or appreciation for Physics Lab resources or assistance.
Label: Resource Appreciation
7. 
Criteria: (Code is redundant, merged with code 6)
 Label: (Removed)
8. 
Criteria: (Code is redundant, merged with code 6)
 Label: (Removed)

Note: Codes 7 and 8 were removed as they are redundant with code 6, which captures the essence of user appreciation and gratitude for resources.

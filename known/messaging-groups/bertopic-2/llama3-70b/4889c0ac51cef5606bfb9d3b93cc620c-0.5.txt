You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Create multiple interpretations for both the interviewee's verbal response and the interviewer's observations. Take note of emotions explicitly or implicitly expressed by the interviewee. Code through the lens of human-computer interaction and learning sciences.

Always follow the output format:
===
Thought: {What is the most common theme among the input quotes? Do not over-interpret the data.}
Phrase: {A single verb phrase that faithfully describes the topic}

Quotes:
- E04: "how to define breeds in netlogo" (interviewer's observation) E04 tries to find certain syntax structures from the AI-generated code and ask for it when it is not there.
- E04: So this is interesting because, you know, obviously it's wrong. So I have to kind of interpret what's going on here. (interviewer's observation) E04 fixes common NetLogo mistakes by himself.
Keywords: netlogo, e04, ai, mistakes, code

Thought: The interviewee is struggling to understand and work with AI-generated code in NetLogo, and is actively trying to troubleshoot and correct mistakes.
Phrase: Troubleshoots AI-generated code.

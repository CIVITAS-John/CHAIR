You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (34 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
34. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community delves into technical discussions on motors, software, and experimental results. Participants seek guidance, share insights, and make suggestions, while the Designer plays a central role in providing technical advice and clarifications. The community showcases a mix of humor, problem-solving, and knowledge exchange, contributing to its active and diverse nature.
1. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
Preliminary tags: suggestion for motor construction
2. P14: [Image 168]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
3. P2: Has it been burned?
Preliminary tags: inquiry on motor status
4. P4: Just play a rotating animation if you turn on the power, that's it 23333.
5. P2: Do we still need algorithms?
6. P4: 2333, it's simple.
7. P2: Algorithms are not simple.
8. P2: IGDT can also add @Designer 
9. P13: [Image 175]
10. P13: Are you all fake?
11. P13: Are you from outer space?
12. P13: I don't understand.
13. P2: Transistors can also be used.
14. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do normal experiments like this...
15. P11: 233 is in electronic circuits.
16. P11: I don't understand either.
17. P2: In the CPU.
18. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned some when I took an optional course in circuits.
19. P2: Add a bipolar capacitor.
20. P2: I learned by myself.
21. P11: That's great, if you have hobbies in it.
22. P14: @P11 Are there still distinctions between arts and sciences now?
23. P2: no
24. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
25. P14: [Image 191]
26. P14: ...Let me get admitted first.
27. P2: I'm still in the second year of junior high school.
28. P11: Keep it up.
29. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
30. P2: What about MOSFETs?
31. P2: @Designer 
32. P17: [Image 198]
33. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
34. P2: +1

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (8 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: sending resources, information dissemination
- Sharing resources, such as documents or links, with the community.
- The act of sharing information, resources, or updates with the community.

2.
Concepts: resource sharing, announcing resource availability
- Designers or users share resources, such as download links, development plans, or announcements.
- Announcing the availability of resources, such as development plans or download addresses.

3.
Concepts: download solution provision, ask for download instructions
- Designer provides a solution to a download-related query.
- Designers provide instructions on how to download the software.

4.
Concepts: information inquiry, information retrieval
- Users ask questions to seek information or clarification, including asking about how to use the product or service.
- A user retrieves or accesses information or resources, and asks questions to gain knowledge or resources related to the software.

5.
Concepts: check for updates, update request
- The user checks for updates or asks about recent changes.
- A user asks for updates or news about the software, or requesting updates or new features for the software, including users asking about upcoming updates or releases.

6.
Concepts: interest in development progress, respond to developer's earlier information on feature development
- User inquires about recent updates or progress.
- A user responds to or comments on the designer's earlier message about feature development.

7.
Concepts: explain intention of question, contextual understanding
- User or designer provides context or background information for a question.
- The user provides context or background information to explain their response or situation, and the designer considers the context in which the question is being asked.

8.
Concepts: clarification exchange, clarifying user requests
- The user seeks clarification or confirmation on a particular point, and the designer provides additional information to clarify the conversation.
- Designer asks follow-up questions to clarify user requests, and a designer or developer asks follow-up questions to clarify a user's needs.

Here are the codes with definitions, relationships, criteria, and labels:

---
1.
Concepts: sending resources, information dissemination
Relationship: Inclusion (sending resources is a part of information dissemination)
Criteria: Designers or users share resources or information with the community.
Label: Information Sharing

2.
Concepts: resource sharing, announcing resource availability
Relationship: Parallel (two aspects of sharing resources)
Criteria: Designers or users share resources and announce their availability to the community.
Label: Resource Announcement

3.
Concepts: download solution provision, ask for download instructions
Relationship: Inclusion (asking for download instructions leads to solution provision)
Criteria: Designers provide solutions to download-related queries or instructions on how to download the software.
Label: Download Support

4.
Concepts: information inquiry, information retrieval
Relationship: Inclusion (information inquiry leads to information retrieval)
Criteria: Users ask questions to seek information or clarification, and access resources or knowledge related to the software.
Label: Information Seeking

5.
Concepts: check for updates, update request
Relationship: Parallel (two aspects of seeking updates)
Criteria: Users check for updates, ask about recent changes, or request updates or new features for the software.
Label: Update Inquiries

6.
Concepts: interest in development progress, respond to developer's earlier information on feature development
Relationship: Intersection (interest in development progress overlaps with responding to earlier information)
Criteria: Users inquire about recent updates or progress and respond to designers' earlier messages about feature development.
Label: Development Progress Inquiry

7.
Concepts: explain intention of question, contextual understanding
Relationship: Inclusion (explaining intention leads to contextual understanding)
Criteria: Users or designers provide context or background information to explain their responses or situations.
Label: Contextual Clarification

8.
Concepts: clarification exchange, clarifying user requests
Relationship: Parallel (two aspects of seeking clarification)
Criteria: Users seek clarification or confirmation, and designers ask follow-up questions to clarify user requests.
Label: Clarification Exchange

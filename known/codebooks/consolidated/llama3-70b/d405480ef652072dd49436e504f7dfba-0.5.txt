You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate verb phrase as label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated verb phrase of code 1}

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1.
Concepts: expressing concerns, identifying pain points
Relationship: Intersection (expressing concerns and identifying pain points are interconnected concepts that occur simultaneously)
Criteria: Users or designers articulate dissatisfaction, uncertainty, or frustration with current features or processes, and designers show interest in users' experiences or identify areas for improvement.
Label: Voicing Dissatisfaction

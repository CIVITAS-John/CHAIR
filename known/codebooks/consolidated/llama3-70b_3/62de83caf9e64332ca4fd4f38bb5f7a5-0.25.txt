You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: emphasizing user expertise, emphasizes expertise requirement
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as emphasizing user expertise implies that a certain level of expertise is required to work with AI-generated code.
Criteria: Participants emphasize the importance of having sufficient expertise to understand and debug AI-generated code.
Phrase: Emphasize expertise requirement

2.
Concepts: instructional clarity, discusses instruction writing skills
Relationship: The two concepts are interconnected, as clear instructions are a key aspect of writing skills, particularly when working with AI systems.
Criteria: Participants discuss the importance of writing clear instructions when working with AI systems.
Phrase: Discuss instruction writing skills

3.
Concepts: relies on ai for syntax, seeks syntax support
Relationship: The two concepts are complementary, as relying on AI for syntax support implies seeking specific code structures or clarification when they are not present.
Criteria: Participants rely on AI for syntax support and seek specific code structures or clarification.
Phrase: Seek syntax support

4.
Concepts: experiences frustration
Relationship: N/A, as this code consists of a single concept.
Criteria: Participants experience frustration with AI performance or limitations, particularly with error resolution options.
Phrase: Experience frustration

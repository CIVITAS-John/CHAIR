You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation begins with a user requesting information, followed by the designers sharing updates about the platform and soliciting feedback. Users provide feedback and feature requests, and the designers engage in participatory design by responding to these requests and providing updates about the development plan. The conversation also touches on topics related to learning sciences, such as the design of educational software and its potential use in teaching physics. The use of emojis and non-verbal communication suggests a level of informality and community building within the group.
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary tags: development plan; user engagement; participatory design
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary tags: user engagement; participatory design; design philosophy
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary tags: user engagement; participatory design; design philosophy
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

Thoughts: The conversation revolves around the development plan of the Physics Lab platform, specifically focusing on the design of electrical experiments. The designers are actively engaging with the users, seeking their input and feedback. This aligns with the principles of participatory design and user engagement. The designers also discuss the potential for future expansion into other areas of physics, such as mechanics and chemistry. The use of emojis and non-verbal communication suggests a level of informality and community building within the group.

Summary: The conversation continues with the designers sharing their development plan for the Physics Lab platform, focusing on the design of electrical experiments. They seek user feedback and engage in participatory design by responding to user requests and providing updates about the development plan. The designers also express their interest in expanding into other areas of physics, such as mechanics and chemistry. The use of emojis and non-verbal communication suggests a level of informality and community building within the group.

Notes: The designers are actively engaging with the users and seeking their input, which aligns with the principles of participatory design and user engagement. The designers also express their interest in expanding into other areas of physics, which could be a potential area for future development. The use of emojis and non-verbal communication suggests a level of informality and community building within the group, which could contribute to the emergence of the Physics Lab's online community.

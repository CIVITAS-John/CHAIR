You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: setting tasks for ai, setting initial ai tasks
- Assigning a new task to an AI-driven interface.
- Participants set initial AI tasks and define tasks through human-AI interaction.

2.
Concepts: seeks ai assistance, seeking human intervention
- Users copy error messages to seek AI assistance.
- Participants seek human intervention to clarify AI responses and engage with AI for error resolution.

3.
Concepts: sharing debugging experiences, sharing prior experiences
- Participants share their debugging experience and recall prior AI debugging experiences.
- Participants share their prior coding and programming experiences and reflect on their relevance to the current task.

4.
Concepts: warning about ai errors and inaccuracies, criticizing ai output and non-determinism
- Participants warn about AI errors and react to AI's common errors, and express concerns about AI-generated inaccuracies.
- Participants criticize the AI output for being incomplete or inaccurate, and criticize AI's non-deterministic responses or lack of consistency.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: setting tasks for ai, setting initial ai tasks
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve the initial interaction between the user and the AI-driven interface, where the user defines the task and sets the initial parameters.
Criteria: Participants define and assign tasks to AI-driven interfaces through human-AI interaction.
Phrase: Defining AI tasks.

2.
Concepts: seeks ai assistance, seeking human intervention
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve seeking help or clarification, either from the AI or from a human, to resolve errors or unclear responses.
Criteria: Users seek assistance from AI or humans to resolve errors or unclear responses.
Phrase: Seeking assistance.

3.
Concepts: sharing debugging experiences, sharing prior experiences
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve sharing past experiences, either related to debugging or prior coding experiences, to inform current task performance.
Criteria: Participants share relevant prior experiences to inform their current task performance.
Phrase: Sharing experiences.

4.
Concepts: warning about ai errors and inaccuracies, criticizing ai output and non-determinism
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve expressing concerns or criticisms about the AI's performance, either in terms of errors, inaccuracies, or non-deterministic responses.
Criteria: Participants express concerns or criticisms about AI performance, including errors, inaccuracies, and non-determinism.
Phrase: Criticizing AI performance.

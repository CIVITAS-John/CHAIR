You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: appreciates the software's 3d effect
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

2.
Label: user need
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

3.
Label: considering diverse hardware environments
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

4.
Label: highlighting teacher specific needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

5.
Label: analyzing the problem
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

6.
Label: encouraging feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

7.
Label: welcome
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

8.
Label: confirm future feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

9.
Label: demonstrating educational relevance
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

10.
Label: clarifying on screen keyboard behavior
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

11.
Label: providing detailed update plans
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

12.
Label: maintain community interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

13.
Label: further investigation into how user feedback is incorporated into the development process could provide insights into the participatory design aspects of physics lab
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

14.
Label: ask for feature update
Quotes:
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]

15.
Label: providing context for software use
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

16.
Label: updating about plans for new features
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

17.
Label: demonstrating transparency
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

18.
Label: emphasizing categorization and prioritization
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

19.
Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

20.
Label: demonstrating familiarity with educational settings
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

21.
Label: utilizing shared materials
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

22.
Label: explaining that the school has disabled the network on classroom computers due to an incident with inappropriate content during a major open class

23.
Label: gather detailed requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

24.
Label: introducing component customization

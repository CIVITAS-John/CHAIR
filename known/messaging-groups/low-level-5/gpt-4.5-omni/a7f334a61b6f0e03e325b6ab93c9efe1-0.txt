You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 explains simulated experiment assessment; designer 1 provides feature details; designer 1 engages in community
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 expresses approval; user 4232 provides positive feedback; user 4232 engages in community
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 plans to consult community; designer 1 engages in participatory design; designer 1 sets future plans
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 consults teachers; designer 1 seeks specific feedback; designer 1 engages in participatory design
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 shares image for feedback; designer 1 seeks confirmation; designer 1 engages in participatory design
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: user 4234 confirms image; user 4234 provides feedback; user 4234 engages in community
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation reveals a collaborative and iterative design process within the Physics Lab's online community. Designer-1 frequently engages with users, seeking their feedback and incorporating their suggestions into the development of new features. User-4232 and User-4234 actively participate by providing feedback and suggestions, indicating a strong sense of community involvement. The designers demonstrate a commitment to participatory design, consulting users and teachers to ensure the features meet educational needs and usability standards. The conversation also highlights the importance of clear communication and managing user expectations regarding updates and feature releases.

Notes: The interaction between designers and users is central to the community's emergence and development. The designers' openness to feedback and iterative approach to design foster a sense of ownership and engagement among users. Future analysis should continue to explore how these dynamics evolve and how they impact the overall success and growth of the Physics Lab community.

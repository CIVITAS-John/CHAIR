Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1

1. Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. P4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. P4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer: We are working on this part
9. P4234: Left side
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Make it simpler...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer: So, use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer: The update is quite large...

Here is a codebook to analyze the conversation:

---
* Summary
The conversation revolves around the development of a simulated experiment assessment feature in a Physics Lab online community. The designer shares updates, solicits feedback, and discusses the design of circuit diagrams with community members.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do designers and community members collaborate to shape the development of the platform? What role do feedback and iterative design play in the development process? How do community members influence the design of the platform?

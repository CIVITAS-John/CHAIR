You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary tags: feature demonstration; bidirectional conversion; community engagement
2. P4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary tags: feedback; iterative design; community engagement
3. Designer: Hmm.
Preliminary tags: acknowledgement; community engagement
4. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. P4232: Indeed
6. Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. P4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

12. Designer: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. P4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

Thoughts: For this conversation, I plan to analyze the emergence of the Physics Lab online community through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will explore how the designer and community members interact, share ideas, and provide feedback. I will also examine how the community shapes the design and development of Physics Lab. Guiding questions include: How does the designer engage with the community? How do community members influence the design of Physics Lab? What features and functionalities are being discussed and prioritized?

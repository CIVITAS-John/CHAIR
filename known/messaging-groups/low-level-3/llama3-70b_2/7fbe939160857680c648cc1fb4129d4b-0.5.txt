You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Preliminary tags: group sharing; collaborative learning; social feature; community engagement
3. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
Preliminary tags: technical support; software access; resource sharing; community resources
4. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
Preliminary tags: development roadmap; feature development; community involvement; user feedback; product development

Preliminary tags: emoji
6. P4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]
Preliminary tags: emotional expression; community tone; social norms; emotional intelligence
7. P4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer: Hello :)
9. P4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer: [Image 2-61] Updates in preparation
11. Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
12. Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
13. P4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?
15. Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
16. P4235: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school
17. P4235: Need the user manual for this software
18. Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
19. P4232: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
20. Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
22. P4235: Can you also include mechanics experiments?
23. Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
25. P4232: Oh, this is nice
26. Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
27. P4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application
29. P4234: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji 2-80]
30. Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
31. P4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer: Hmm.

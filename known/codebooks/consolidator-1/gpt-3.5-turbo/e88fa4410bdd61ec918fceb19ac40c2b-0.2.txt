You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other.
Write clear and contextualized criteria to apply across quotes. Do not provide examples. Then, refine the label if necessary.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

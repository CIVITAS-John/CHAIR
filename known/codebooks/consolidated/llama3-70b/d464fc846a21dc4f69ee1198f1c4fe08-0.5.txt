You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: specific feature request, making detailed feature requests
- Users request specific features or functionalities, making a specific request.
- User makes a detailed feature request.

2.
Concepts: showing interest, demonstrating interest in platform
- Users express enthusiasm and interest in the platform and its features, expressing interest or enthusiasm for using the software.
- A user demonstrates interest in using or accessing the platform.

3.
Concepts: alternative solution suggestion, alternative solution exploration
- Offering alternative solutions or workarounds, considering alternative approaches.
- Expressing openness to alternative solutions or ideas, and offering or suggesting alternative solutions or options.

4.
Concepts: elaborated question, answer elaboration
- Providing additional context or explanation for a question
- Elaborating on a previous answer or providing additional details or explanations.

5.
Concepts: development prioritization
- Designers or community members prioritize development tasks or goals based on plans and user feedback.
- Designer indicates prioritization of electrical and magnetism sections.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: specific feature request, making detailed feature requests
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts describe users making specific requests)
Criteria: Users explicitly state a specific feature or functionality they want to see in the platform, providing detailed information about the request.
Label: Specific Feature Request

2.
Concepts: showing interest, demonstrating interest in platform
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts describe users expressing interest in the platform)
Criteria: Users verbally express enthusiasm or interest in using or accessing the platform, its features, or functionalities.
Label: Platform Interest

3.
Concepts: alternative solution suggestion, alternative solution exploration
Relationship: Inclusion (alternative solution suggestion is a type of alternative solution exploration)
Criteria: Users propose or consider alternative approaches, solutions, or workarounds to address a problem or need, demonstrating openness to different ideas.
Label: Alternative Solutioning

4.
Concepts: elaborated question, answer elaboration
Relationship: Intersection (elaborated questions and answer elaboration are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Users provide additional context, explanations, or details to clarify a question or answer, enhancing understanding and facilitating further discussion.
Label: Elaboration and Clarification

5.
Concepts: development prioritization
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Designers or community members allocate resources, attention, or effort to specific development tasks or goals based on user feedback, plans, or priorities.
Label: Development Prioritization

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Thoughts: To analyze how Physics Lab's online community emerged, I need to look for tags related to community formation, interactions between members, shared interests and activities, and the role of the platform itself. Some potentially relevant angles are: indications of existing relationships or connections, expressions of curiosity or learning, sharing of resources or knowledge, and discussions around the app's features or development.

Tags for each message (8 in total):
1. clarification request; interaction
2. visual communication; content sharing  
3. game discussion; shared interest
4. app usage; learning  
5. new user; app adoption
6. external resource sharing; information exchange
7. software update; feature request
8. troubleshooting issue; technical discussion

Summary: The conversation involves multiple users discussing and engaging with the Physics Lab app. There are expressions of interest in using the app, sharing resources related to it, and discussing its features or potential issues. Some users seem to be new to the app, while others demonstrate existing familiarity. The interactions indicate an emerging community forming around the shared interest in the app and physics-related topics.

Notes: The presence of clarification requests, sharing of visuals/links/resources, discussions of app usage and troubleshooting, and references to games/interests suggest an active community starting to take shape. Members are learning from each other, exchanging information, and potentially building connections over their mutual engagement with Physics Lab. The app itself appears to be facilitating these interactions and community formation. Further analysis could explore the dynamics of knowledge sharing, relationship building, and the role of the app's features/design in fostering the online community.

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You are finding and organizing categories from existing ones. A list of initial categories and qualitative codes is provided.
Merge categories that are too specific and/or small. Split categories that are too big. Consolidate into two levels of categories.
Optimize names of the rest to be more representative. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: 
There are several categories that can be merged as they are too specific or have overlapping content. For example, "communication acknowledgment" and "communication clarity" can be merged into a broader category like "communication approach". On the other hand, categories like "community interaction" are too broad and can be split into more specific categories like "social interaction" and "community engagement".

Categories to split:
- community interaction

Categories to merge:
- communication acknowledgment
- communication clarity

Refined categories:
1. Communication approach
* Information acknowledgment
* Acknowledgment of clarification
* Acknowledgment of no issues
* Clarification of misunderstanding
2. Community dynamics
* Community management
* Community norms
3. Social interaction
* Introduction/greeting
* Social engagement
* Gratitude expression
* Encouragement
* Appreciation/feedback
* Playful interaction
* Emotive expression
4. Community engagement
* Announcement
* Design inspiration
* Understanding confirmation
* Topic expansion
* Community moderation
* Check-in
* Mention of designer
* Agreement
* Designer engagement
* Acknowledgment of authority
* Self-deprecating humor
* Hesitant acknowledgment
* Acknowledgment of understanding
* Passive engagement
* Expression of surprise
* Conversation pause

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: upload image
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

2.
Label: sets tone for open communication
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

3.
Label: plans for future feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

4.
Label: outlining simulation plans
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

5.
Label: considering suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm.

6.
Label: guides users on accessing specific platform features
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

7.
Label: displaying uncertainty
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- User: How do you use the PC version?
- User: Is there a user manual?

8.
Label: community response
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

9.
Label: communicating the priority of electromagnetism over mechanics for the time being
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

10.
Label: listing featuer updates and bug fixes
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

12.
Label: connecting to community
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

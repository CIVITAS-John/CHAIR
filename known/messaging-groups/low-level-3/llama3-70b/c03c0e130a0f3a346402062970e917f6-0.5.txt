You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (13 in total):
1. {interpretation of message 1}; {another}; ...
...
13. {interpretation of message 13}; {another}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary codes: request for avatar upload; uncensored avatar
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary codes: pc version inquiry
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary codes: avatar upload initiation; user role inquiry
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary codes: teacher self identification
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I will focus on identifying the primary actions, requests, and responses within the conversation. I will consider the context of the online community's emergence and the roles of designers and users. I will also look for any power dynamics, decision-making processes, and knowledge sharing.

Codes for each message:

1. Image sharing; community building
2. Request for avatar upload; uncensored avatar; user identity
3. PC version inquiry; platform interest
4. Avatar upload initiation; user role inquiry; community engagement
5. Teacher self-identification; user role clarification
6. Community announcement; development plan sharing; PC download information
7. Open call for feedback; user input solicitation
8. Request for features; mechanical waves demonstration; optical experiments; user expectations
9. Priority setting; development roadmap; electrical section prioritization
10. Gathering opinions; user feedback; decision-making process
11. Appreciation expression; community gratitude
12. PC version inquiry; platform access
13. File access; resource sharing; community support

Summary: The conversation revolves around the emergence of the Physics Lab online community. Designers and users are interacting, sharing information, and discussing the development roadmap. Users are inquiring about PC versions, requesting features, and expressing gratitude. Designers are sharing development plans, soliciting feedback, and prioritizing tasks.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, seeking input, and sharing information. The community is still in its early stages, and users are interested in the platform's development. The conversation is collaborative, with users providing suggestions and designers responding to them. The power dynamics seem to be relatively balanced, with designers seeking user input and users influencing the development process.

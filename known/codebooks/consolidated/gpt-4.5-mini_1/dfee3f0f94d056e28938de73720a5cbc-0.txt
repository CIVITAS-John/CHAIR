You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: appreciate timely feedback from ai, value immediate feedback from ai
- Interviewees highlight the AI's ability to provide quick feedback on code.
- Interviewees value the immediate feedback provided by AI and recognize its utility in offering quick solutions.

2.
Concepts: debug ai-generated code, reads through code manually
- Interviewees engage in debugging AI-generated code, actively troubleshooting errors with the interface.
- Interviewees manually review and debug code when AI-generated solutions do not work as expected.

3.
Concepts: note ai failures, identifies inability to fix certain errors
- Interviewees note instances of AI failures and express frustration with its limitations in resolving issues.
- Interviewee notes the AI's inability to resolve certain errors, indicating limitations in its troubleshooting capabilities.

4.
Concepts: beginner support, reflect on novice struggles
- Interviewees highlight the challenges beginners face in programming and express a need for tools that can help identify conceptual errors.
- Interviewees reflect on the challenges novices face in programming and note the lack of debugging skills among them.

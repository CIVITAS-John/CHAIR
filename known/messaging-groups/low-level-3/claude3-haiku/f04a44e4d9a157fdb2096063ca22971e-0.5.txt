You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Summary of previous conversation: This conversation appears to be taking place within an online community related to a software or platform called Physics Lab. The participants are discussing various aspects of the community, including shared resources, in-jokes, problem-solving, and astronomy-related content. The conversation suggests a collaborative and supportive community where members engage in knowledge sharing, problem-solving, and the exchange of resources. There are also indications of community-specific references and in-jokes, suggesting a shared understanding and culture among the participants.
1. P11: ðŸ˜‚
Preliminary tags: community expression
2. P2: I mean in the software.
Preliminary tags: community specific references; community communication
3. P11: Then ask the group owner.
Preliminary tags: community resources; community communication
4. Designer: Mars is outside of Earth.
5. Designer: Whatâ€™s the problem...
6. P4: No problem at all.
7. P2: The moon?
8. P1: The moon isn't drawn, right?
9. P14: Maybe it hasn't been made yet.
10. Designer: Last time there wasn't enough time.
11. P4: The moon is useless.
12. P4: ðŸ˜‚
13. Designer: It depends on the scale.
14. P2: Who said that?
15. P4: universe sandbox
16. Designer: There will be multiple presets.
17. Designer: Because in reality, you encounter various possibilities, and many questions are about near-Earth space stations.
18. P11: Yes.
19. Designer: Artificial satellite orbits.
20. Designer: These will be more involved.
21. Designer: Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter this often...
22. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
23. P1: John, have you updated Android?
24. Designer: No, I'll update it today.
25. P17: [Image 1-126]
26. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
27. Designer: I'll buy one for space.
28. P17: It's the starry sky.
29. P1: Don't imitate it exactly.
30. P14: There is also software on Steam that simulates celestial bodies.
31. P14: 78 or 79, I can't remember.
32. P14: [Image 1-133]
33. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
34. P11: Check it out online, this can't be explained in a few words. @P2 
35. P2: Can a motor be added? @Designer

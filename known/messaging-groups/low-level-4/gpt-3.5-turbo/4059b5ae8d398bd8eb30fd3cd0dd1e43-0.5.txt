You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in the Physics Lab online community revolves around users seeking information and updates from the designers, who are actively engaging with the users, sharing upcoming features, and seeking feedback. There is a focus on user needs, such as a user manual and specific functions for easier use in educational settings. The designers are responsive to user suggestions and are working on incorporating new features like bidirectional conversion between physical and circuit diagrams. The community displays a collaborative and iterative design process.
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 explains the process of connecting physical and circuit diagrams
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 suggests a systematic approach to development
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 acknowledges the suggestion
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

7.
Label: seek guidance for practical use
Quotes:
- User: How to download?

8.
Label: commit to user suggestions in future updates
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

14.
Label: expand community interests
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

15.
Label: user 4232 suggests export function
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

16.
Label: support effective use of the platform
Quotes:
- Designer: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch

17.
Label: user 4232 acknowledges designer's input
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

18.
Label: prepare users for substantial changes in the platform

19.
Label: provide input on design preferences
Quotes:
- User: Left side

20.
Label: highlight user centered design effectiveness
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

21.
Label: hypothesize compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

22.
Label: highlight its effectiveness in educational contexts
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

23.
Label: user 4234 suggests improvement
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

24.
Label: provide details
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

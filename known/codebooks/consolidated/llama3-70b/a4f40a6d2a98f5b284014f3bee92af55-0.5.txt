You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
The merging plan seems to be a good starting point. However, upon closer inspection, I identify a few areas for improvement:

* "Platform and Community Structure" might be a bit too broad, as it combines two distinct aspects. Consider splitting it into two separate categories: "Platform Features" and "Community Roles and Structure".
* "Information and Social Interactions" is a bit vague. Consider renaming it to "Social Interactions and Cues" to better reflect its content.
* "Technical Aspects" is a good merge, but it might be beneficial to create a subcategory for "ux and development" to distinguish it from "technical issues".
* "Collaborative Design and Knowledge Building" is a good merge, but it might be beneficial to create a subcategory for "co-design interactions" to distinguish it from "collaborative knowledge building".
* "Community and Social Dynamics" might be a bit too broad, as it combines two distinct aspects. Consider splitting it into two separate categories: "Community Building" and "Social Dynamics".

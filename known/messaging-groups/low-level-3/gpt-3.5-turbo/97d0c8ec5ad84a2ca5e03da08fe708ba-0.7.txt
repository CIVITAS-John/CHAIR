You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community continues to explore various aspects of user experience, payment methods, sensor technology, and ad integration. Users discuss their preferences and challenges with payment options, while also engaging in humor and collaborative coding endeavors. The designer responds to user inquiries, addresses concerns about ads and payment methods, and emphasizes the collaborative nature of the platform's development.
1. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but I simply don't know how to top up
Preliminary tags: payment methods; user experience
2. P11: Can also adapt to 3D Touch
Preliminary tags: sensor technology; touch sensitivity
3. Designer: Can you top up directly on the app store?
Preliminary tags: app store integration; payment options
4. P14: Seems a bit troublesome
5. P2: ……
6. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now
7. P14: After all, just a middle school student
8. Designer: That's true
9. Designer: Then let's watch ads hh
10. P14: Yes, we can
11. P2: What's up with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
12. P2: A middle schooler is even better than you
13. P11: Just hope that ads won't take up too much of the interface
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
15. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
19. Designer: Just asking you to watch ads for points, use points to unlock new content like this
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come hit me along the Ethernet cable
21. P2: I can code
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 280]
24. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is too disgusting
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen is not big, but it's still impressive.
27. P2: It even forces you to click.

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging

* Category h
=> Category i

# Reflection
The draft merging plan has merged 50 codes into 18 categories. Upon reviewing the merged categories, I noticed that:

* The category "Knowledge and Learning" might be too broad and could be split into "Knowledge Sharing" and "Learning Strategies".
* The category "Technical Aspects" might be too broad and could be split into "Technical Exchange" and "Technical Considerations".
* The category "Design" might be too broad and could be split into "Design Process" and "Design Considerations".
* The category "Communication" might be too broad and could be split into "Communication and Interaction" and "Communication Approach".
* The category "Emotional Aspects" might be too broad and could be split into "Emotional Safety" and "Emotional Support".
* The category "Future Development" might be too broad and could be split into "Future Development" and "Innovative Technologies".
* The category "Learning Environment" might be too broad and could be split into "Learning Environment", "Learning Resources", and "Learning Strategies".
* The category "Human-Computer Interaction and Participatory Design" might be too broad and could be split into "Human-Computer Interaction" and "Participatory Design".
* The category "Academic Context" might be too broad and could be split into "Academic Context" and "Context and Setting".
* The category "Troubleshooting and Ethics" might be too broad and could be split into "Troubleshooting Strategies" and "Moral Principles".
* The category "Miscellaneous" is too broad and could be split into separate categories for "Space Exploration", "Data Visualization", and "Visual Attention".

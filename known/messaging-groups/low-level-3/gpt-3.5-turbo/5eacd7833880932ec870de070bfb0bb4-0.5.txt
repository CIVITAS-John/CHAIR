You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (8 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
8. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

Thoughts: When considering these messages from the learning sciences perspective, it's essential to look at how users engage with the platform and its features. From a human-computer interaction standpoint, understanding user inquiries and feedback can provide insights into usability and user experience. Lastly, through the lens of participatory design, observing how users interact with external resources and seek updates can offer valuable information on community engagement and co-creation with the designer.

Tags for each message:
1. user inquiry; platform feature reference
2. image sharing
3. platform feature reference
4. user inquiry
5. user feedback
6. external resource sharing
7. user inquiry; platform update inquiry
8. user inquiry

Summary: The conversation includes user inquiries about platform usage, requests for updates, sharing of external resources, and user feedback on downloading the platform. Additionally, there is a reference to a platform feature and an image shared.

Notes: These messages provide a glimpse into user engagement with the Physics Lab platform. The inquiries and feedback indicate a level of interest and interaction with the features and resources available. The designer could use this information to improve user experience and tailor updates to meet user needs.

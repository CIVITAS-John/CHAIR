Label: emphasize convenience
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

7.
Label: explaining classroom limitations
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

8.
Label: iterative development process influenced by user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Label: some users demonstrate self reliance and problem solving skills
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

15.
Label: highlight educational needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

16.
Label: praising software design
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

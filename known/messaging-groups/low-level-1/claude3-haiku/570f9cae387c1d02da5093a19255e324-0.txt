Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation starts with a request for information and a response, followed by agreement and discussion of various physics-related topics. The participants share images, ask questions, provide clarifications, and express reactions ranging from confusion to surprise and positive feedback. The conversation demonstrates the emergence of an online community where members engage in knowledge-sharing, problem-solving, and social interactions.
1. P2: I'm talking about the software.
2. P11: Then ask the group owner.
3. Designer: Mars is outside the Earth.
4. Designer: What's the problem?
5. P4: No problem.
6. P2: What about the moon?
7. P1: The moon is not drawn, right?
8. P14: Maybe it hasn't been done yet.
9. P14: 
10. Designer: Last time it was too rushed.
11. P4: The moon is useless.
12. P4: 2333
13. Designer: It depends on the scale.
14. P2: Who said that?
15. P4: universe sandbox
16. Designer: There will be multiple presets.
17. Designer: Because in reality, you encounter many possible questions, many of which are about near-Earth space stations.
18. P11: Yes.
19. Designer: Artificial satellite orbits.
20. Designer: These will involve more.
21. Designer: Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter this normally...
22. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
23. P1: John, have you become more Android?
24. Designer: No, I'll update it today.
25. P17: [Image]
26. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
27. Designer: I'll buy a ticket to space.
28. P17: It's the starry sky.
29. P1: Don't imitate it exactly the same.
30. P14: There are also software imitating celestial bodies on Steam.

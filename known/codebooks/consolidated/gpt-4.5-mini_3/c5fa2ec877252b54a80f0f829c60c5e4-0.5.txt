You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. 
Concepts: gather user feedback, integrate user feedback
Relationship: The concepts are sequentially related, where gathering feedback is the initial step that informs the subsequent integration into development processes.
Criteria: Designers seek and gather user feedback regarding their experiences and suggestions, and then actively integrate this feedback into their development processes.
Phrase: Actively incorporate user feedback

2. 
Concepts: acknowledge user experience, acknowledge and respond to feedback
Relationship: The concepts are complementary, where acknowledging user experience sets the stage for responding to feedback, thus creating a dialogue.
Criteria: Designers acknowledge or validate user experiences related to the software's functionality and effectively respond to user feedback regarding the software.
Phrase: Validate and respond to user experiences

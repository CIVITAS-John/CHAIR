You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Haha
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: After the official release of the new version, there will be more people here.
5. Designer: I guess it's because the teacher finds it annoying when people talk too much.233
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image 6]
8. P5: 233 By the way, let's see if there are any good designs to learn from.
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: Like a microcomputer.

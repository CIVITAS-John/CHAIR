You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

~~~
1. iterative design, feedback and iteration.
- The process of continually improving the software based on user feedback.
- The exchange of feedback between users and the designer, and the designer's responsiveness to that feedback.

2. gathering opinions, community involvement in decision-making.
- Instances where the community gathers opinions before making decisions on lab development.
- Assessing how the designer involves the community in decision-making processes and prioritization of content development.

3. user involvement, user engagement.
- The extent to which users are involved in the design and development process.
- The level of active participation and interest shown by the group members in the development and use of the software.

4. collaborative dialogue.
- Instances of users engaging with each other or designers, including feedback and responses.
- Instances of active collaboration between the designer and community in the design process.

5. user feedback.
- Discussions where users provide feedback, suggestions, or comments.
- Direct user comments on the software's usability, functionality, or satisfaction.

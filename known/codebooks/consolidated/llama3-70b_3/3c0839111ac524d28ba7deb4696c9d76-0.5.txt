1.
Label: similar to pair programming
Quotes:
- E01: So maybe the details are wrong and, you know, Michael Tamalo or somebody jumped on me because I posted some answer and it used some function that wasn't available. AI had hallucinated some function. (interviewer's observation) AI might hallucinates.

2.
Label: prior experiences in computer programming
Quotes:
- E01: I started programming in 1964 at IBM. ... And since then I have programmed in production code in at least 20 different software languages. (interviewer's observation) E01's prior experiences in computer programming in general.

3.
Label: highlights best practices
Quotes:
- E04: It includes debugging, it is actually trying to incorporate like a unit test, which is really cool and really helpful, especially for beginners, because they can kind of, you know, check their inputs. Beginners, everyone really. They can debug their code appropriately. (interviewer's observation) Debugging capability.

4.
Label: the ai's ability to provide immediate feedback and clarify errors is highly valued
Quotes:
- E04: I guess, in their databases, they still have like, NetLogo 5 in there and stuff. So like, for example, you know, the anonymous functions, they still use like, the old, sometimes I'll get like, the old functionality for the anonymous functions. (interviewer's observation) Writing code in older versions of NetLogo

5.
Label: acknowledges partial success
Quotes:
- E04: It was really nice that it, like with the troubleshooting errors, for example, like at least in principle, I know that we had this one that we couldn't fix. It seemed like it was able to kind of do some better troubleshooting to a certain extent. (interviewer's observation) Better troubleshooting capability.

6.
Label: seeking guidance on plotting model outputs
Quotes:

Label: values streamlined help seeking
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.

8.
Label: proposing hive feedback system
Quotes:
- E01: I call it hive feedback system, where if anyone in the world learns a new fact, or like, Oh, if you're a nurse, here's the word. If you're a transcriptionist, here's the word. If anybody learns it, then it goes into the system into the cloud. And now the cloud won't make that mistake anymore. And then the developer doesn't have to solve all these problems, because all the users solve their own problems. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how the human-AI collaborative system could be used to increase general productivity.

9.
Label: alternatives include stack exchange and listserv
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

15.
Label: ai assisted code review
Quotes:
- E01: So if I'm writing long NetLogo code now, I'd probably have ChatGPT just open on the side. And I write a block of code and then I handed ChatGPT. Say, could I have done this better?

19.
Label: encountering incorrect error messages
Quotes:
- E04: maybe you saw something that I didn't, but from my perspective, it seemed as though the code was set up appropriately, but it was marking the syntax as wrong.

(interviewer's observation) Shows error messages even when it seems to be correct (that's a bug identified)

20.
Label: perceiving randomness in ai responses
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that.

(interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

21.
Label: warns against blind reliance on ai
Quotes:
- E04: To me, it seems like you need to have a certain degree of expertise to understand where the errors are and how to fix them. Because otherwise it's like you're going down this path where you're blindly following the ChatGPT and you have no idea what's going on. For less experienced people, I wouldn't like that because it could put you in a worse situation. (interviewer's observation) Requires expertise to understand errors and debug them. Risks to blindly follow ChatGPT, esp. for less experienced people.

22.
Label: identifies "scope" as a learning challenge
Quotes:
- E01: And I find what I have trouble with and certainly what beginners have trouble with is "scope".   You know, when you go from one point to another and all of a sudden you're, you're not no longer in ask turtles to do something you're in, ask links to do. But you know, so all of a sudden you've shifted, you've shifted your variable space and this happens implicitly and all of a sudden you're writing code and then it gives you an error that of the nature X Y Z doesn't operate in a turtle context. (interviewer's observation) AI needs to support learning of the "scope" concept in NetLogo.

23.
Label: discerning ai code adoption
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) Again, he reads the code and selectively copies code to the model.

24.
Label: values iterative approach
Quotes:
- E01: I've observed when I tried to suggest ChatGPT to other people, they're, um, they are amazed at the output that I can get. And that's because I know how to ask six questions in a row to zero in on what I'm after. (interviewer's observation) To maximize the capability of ChatGPT, one needs to know how to iteratively ask questions.

25.
Label: expressing satisfaction with the interface's usability
Quotes:
- E04: It seems like it's, you know, pretty straightforward to use and like intuitive, which is nice. And it's like, it's easy to interact with.

26.
Label: and that is key to work with ai
Quotes:
- E01: In terms of learning experiences, like ramping up to using an assistant wrapping up to using ChatGPT might have some sort of evaluates. How well can you write instructions for another person?

27.
Label: ensures clarity
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 dictated each of the parameter fields.

28.
Label: prefers well commented and documented code over complex, condensed solutions
Quotes:
- E01: I don't want chat GPT to write 27 operations in one line and show how brilliant it is. I wanted to separate out the code and, and it did a good job of not only did it write the code, but it commented the code. And then in addition to commenting the code externally, it did documentation. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT tends to provide comments and documentation. Generated code is easy to read.

29.
Label: proposing that ai could help people ask more questions
Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

30.
Label: valuing its potential while recognizing its limitations
Quotes:
- E01: I think the key is to not replace human judgment and ability, but to find a fast way to increase human capability and judgment. (interviewer's observation) Augmentation of human capabilities & building on human judgement. Subjectivity of humanity?

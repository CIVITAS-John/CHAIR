Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the community's emergence.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. P16: ï¼‹1
2. P10: May I ask what does "+1" mean?
3. P11: It means "me too".
4. P13: +1 means the same opinion.
5. P13: emmmm
6. P13: You can search on Baidu.
7. P10: Oh, I see. Thank you.

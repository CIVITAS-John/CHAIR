You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (32 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
32. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Information seeking behavior; online search recommendation; specific search engine mentioned
2. Appreciation for assistance; gratitude expressed
3. Simple agreement with a previous comment
4. Cost implication in experiments; financial aspect of lab work
5. Passive engagement; observation without active participation
6. Acknowledgment of a lack of issues or challenges
7. Inquiry about astronomy knowledge
8. Negative response to previous inquiry
9. Seeking clarification on a specific topic
10. Image shared in conversation
11. Restriction of astronomy knowledge to a specific location
12. Image shared in conversation
13. Image shared in conversation
14. Image shared in conversation

Summary: The conversation in the Physics Lab online community ranges from information-seeking behaviors to discussions on astronomy, software, and elements. Members engage through sharing images, expressing agreement, confusion, and appreciation, while also hinting at the emergence of subtopics within the community discussions.

Notes: The community seems to have diversified interests spanning from practical lab concerns to broader scientific topics like astronomy. The use of images might indicate a visual element in communication, potentially aiding in knowledge transfer. Further exploration could uncover how these diverse interests and modes of communication contribute to the emergence and evolution of the online community.

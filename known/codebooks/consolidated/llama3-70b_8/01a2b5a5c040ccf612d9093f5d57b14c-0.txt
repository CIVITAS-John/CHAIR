You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: fixing errors manually, hands-on debugging
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the participant's approach to error correction, with a focus on manual intervention.
Criteria: Participants manually correct errors in AI-generated code through hands-on debugging.
Phrase: Manually debug and correct errors.

2.
Concepts: critiquing ai limitations, discussing ai's capacity limitations, recognizing ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they all describe the participant's awareness and evaluation of AI's limitations.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge and discuss AI's limitations and capacity constraints.
Phrase: Recognize and critique AI limitations.

3.
Concepts: reading error messages, critiquing unclear error messages
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the participant's interaction with error messages, with a focus on understanding and evaluating their clarity.
Criteria: Participants read and evaluate error messages for clarity and usefulness.
Phrase: Read and critique error messages.

4.
Concepts: valuing ai feedback, appreciating instant feedback
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the participant's positive perception of AI-generated feedback, with a focus on its timeliness.
Criteria: Participants appreciate and value immediate feedback from AI.

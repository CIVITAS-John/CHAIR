You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (10 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...

10. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary codes: appreciation; designer acknowledgement; gratitude expression
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary codes: platform inquiry; pc version request; software availability question
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary codes: file access; group file acknowledgment; resource utilization
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary codes: component update; ideal component removal; simulation enhancement
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary codes: component introduction; student power supply feature; dc/ac support
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

Thoughts: For this first round of coding, I will focus on identifying the actors, their actions, and the context in which they are interacting. I will examine the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to understand how the online community of Physics Lab emerged. I will explore how the designers and users interact, what kind of support is provided, and what kind of feedback is given.

Codes for each message:

1. appreciation; designer acknowledgement; gratitude expression
2. platform inquiry; pc version request; software availability question
3. file access; group file acknowledgment; resource utilization
4. image sharing; visual communication
5. component update; ideal component removal; simulation enhancement
6. component introduction; student power supply feature; dc/ac support
7. feedback solicitation; community engagement
8. usage inquiry; pc version guidance
9. image sharing; visual communication
10. system compatibility; xp system limitation

Summary: The conversation starts with a user expressing gratitude towards the designers. Then, a user inquires about downloading the PC version of Physics Lab, and another user acknowledges accessing group files. The designers share an image and provide updates on the simulation, including the removal of ideal components and the introduction of a student power supply. The conversation also involves users asking about using the PC version and sharing images. Finally, a designer clarifies that the system does not support XP.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with the users, providing updates and feedback. The users are curious about the PC version and its usage. The conversation suggests that the community is interested in learning and understanding how to use Physics Lab. The designers' responses indicate a willingness to support and engage with the users.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: peer-programming, exploring ai as a peer programmer
Relationship: The concept of peer programming is being redefined and expanded to include AI as a potential collaborator.
Criteria: Participants discuss and explore the possibility of AI as a peer programmer in their learning and coding process.
Phrase: Exploring AI as a peer programmer

2.
Concepts: imagining ai as a pair programmer, envisioning ai as a collaborative partner
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, with imagining AI as a pair programmer being a more specific instance of envisioning AI as a collaborative partner.
Criteria: Participants imagine and envision AI as a collaborative partner that can assist and question their decisions in the coding and learning process.
Phrase: Envisioning AI as a collaborative partner

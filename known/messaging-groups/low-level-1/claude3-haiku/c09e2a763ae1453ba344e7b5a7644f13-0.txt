1. Designer: I guess it's because the teacher finds it annoying when people talk too much.233
2. P1: hello
3. P4: [Image]
4. P5: 233 By the way, let's see if there are any good designs to learn from.
5. Designer: Good design?
6. P6: Like a microcomputer.
7. Designer: Let's talk about logic gates.
8. P2: The CPU of a computer is made up of logic gates.
9. P5: Hmm.
10. P5: I need logic gates for making a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
11. P6: [Image]
12. P6: [Image]
13. P7: How to play?
14. Designer: Play by conducting experiments.233

You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
2. P4232: This is a really good idea
3. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

5. Designer: [Image]This one.
6. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.
7. Designer: Um... left or right?
8. Designer: We are working on this.
9. P4234: Left side.
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Keep it simple...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side without crossing.
13. Designer: So, should we use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, and may produce some weird results.
15. Designer: [Image]
16. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be updates this week? [Emoji]
18. Designer: There will be updates. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer: The update is quite substantial...

Summary: The conversation revolves around the development of a simulated experimental assessment function for an educational physics application. The designer shares ideas, seeks input from the community (especially teachers), and provides visuals for clarification. Community members offer feedback, suggestions, and expertise. The designer acknowledges the input, expresses gratitude, and commits to improvement. There is a collaborative effort to make design decisions and a sense of community support and involvement.

Notes: The conversation highlights the emergence of an online community around the development of an educational physics application. Key elements include:
- Open communication and sharing of ideas
- Seeking input and expertise from the community
- Collaboration and collective decision-making
- Providing updates and managing expectations
- Expressing gratitude and committing to improvement
- Use of visuals and emojis for better communication
- A sense of community support and involvement

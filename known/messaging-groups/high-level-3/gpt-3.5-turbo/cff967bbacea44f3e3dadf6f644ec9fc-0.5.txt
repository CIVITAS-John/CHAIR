You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

* Summary
The conversation revolves around the technical aspects of Physics Lab's software, focusing on updates, compatibility with different operating systems, and suggestions for improvements.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the learning sciences perspective, explore how the designers provide technical information to support users' learning and engagement with the software. From the human-computer interaction perspective, examine how the designers address user queries about system compatibility and provide guidance for optimal usage. Finally, through the lens of participatory design, consider how users contribute feedback and suggestions to enhance the software, creating a collaborative online community within Physics Lab.

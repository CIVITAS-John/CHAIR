You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* digital communication
* collaborative knowledge
=> online interaction (covers digital communication and collaborative aspects)

* community formation
* social environment
=> community building (encompasses formation and social aspects)

* design challenges
* knowledge development
=> design and knowledge evolution (combines challenges and development)

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging? 
  Yes, the categories seem to be related to the research question, and some can be merged further. For example, "online interaction" and "community building" could be merged into a broader category, but it's essential to avoid creating huge categories.

- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
  No, the merged categories seem to be well-defined and concise.

- Is any naming inaccurate?
  No, the names of the merged categories accurately reflect the combined aspects.

# Final Merging
* digital communication
* collaborative knowledge
=> online interaction

* community formation
* social environment
=> community building

* design challenges
* knowledge development
=> design and knowledge evolution

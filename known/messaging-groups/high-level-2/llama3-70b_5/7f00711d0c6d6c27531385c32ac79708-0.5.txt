Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1

- "Example quote 2"

1. Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. P4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. P4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer: We are working on this part
9. P4234: Left side
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Make it simpler...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer: So, use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer: The update is quite large...

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab's online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation is between a designer and community members (P4232 and P4234) discussing the development of a simulated experiment assessment feature for electricity in the Physics Lab platform. The designer shares updates, asks for feedback, and consults the community on specific design decisions.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed from multiple theoretical angles, including learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do the designer and community members collaborate on design decisions? How do they negotiate and resolve disagreements? What role does feedback play in shaping the design of the platform?

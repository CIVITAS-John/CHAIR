You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (32 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: confirmed professional role
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

2.
Label: balance user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

3.
Label: highlighted user feedback importance
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

4.
Label: manage community expectations regarding project timelines
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

5.
Label: engage non verbally
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

6.
Label: express gratitude for assistance
Quotes:
- User: Thank you.

7.
Label: set boundaries for future development
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

8.
Label: engaged with a community member
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

9.
Label: promote problem solving culture
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

10.
Label: user 4229 builds rapport with designers
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

11.
Label: recount previous observations
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

12.
Label: designer 1 supports user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

13.
Label: connect features to user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

14.
Label: share information about current feature development
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

15.
Label: feature request
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

16.
Label: highlight user experiences
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

17.
Label: engage with technical aspects
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

18.
Label: maintained courteous interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

20.
Label: inform about existing feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

21.
Label: suggest practical use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

22.
Label: comparison to similar apps
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

23.
Label: seek support
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

24.
Label: express satisfaction
Quotes:

28.
Label: communicated schedule
Quotes:
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

29.
Label: engaged in community support

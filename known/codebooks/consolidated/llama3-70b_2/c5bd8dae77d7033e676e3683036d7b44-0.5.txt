You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

3.
Label: commit to providing a solution

8.
Label: informs about ongoing work

- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

11.
Label: classroom technology constraints are significant factors influencing the software design

12.
Label: context
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

13.
Label: clarification
Quotes:

19.
Label: suggesting collaboration
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

20.
Label: designer 1 consults teachers
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

23.
Label: seeks clarification on the preferred side for circuit diagram intersections
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- User: Left side

24.
Label: there will be
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

25.
Label: compliment
Quotes:

Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: This idea is really good

26.
Label: detailing experimental features
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

27.
Label: acknowledging update availability
Quotes:
- User: Updated
- User: ok

28.
Label: seeking to improve avatar

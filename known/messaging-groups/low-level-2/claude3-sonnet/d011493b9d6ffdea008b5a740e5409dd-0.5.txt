You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
3. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. P4231: [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
6. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
7. Designer: [Image]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation, I will look for patterns and themes related to social interactions and the emergence of the online community. I will identify tags for each message that capture the intent, tone, social dynamics, and community-building aspects.

Analysis for all 9 messages:
1. request; respect; technical-specification; feature-suggestion
2. prioritization; planning; coordination
3. gathering-feedback; consensus-building; organization  
4. appreciation; politeness
5. information-seeking; community-engagement
6. self-resolution; gratitude
7. visual-aid; illustration
8. update-announcement; technical-change; realism
9. new-feature; functionality-expansion; versatility

Summary: This conversation revolves around the development and improvement of the Physics Lab software. Community members make feature requests, provide feedback, and seek information. The designer prioritizes tasks, gathers input, announces updates, and shares visuals. There is a collaborative dynamic between the community and the designer, with expressions of respect, gratitude, and a desire for consensus.

Notes:
- The community members actively engage by suggesting features (e.g., wave simulations, optical experiments) and seeking information (e.g., downloading the software).
- The designer acknowledges the requests, prioritizes tasks, and involves the community in decision-making processes.
- There is a sense of appreciation and politeness from both sides, fostering a positive and collaborative environment.
- The designer shares updates, technical changes, and visual aids, keeping the community informed and engaged.
- The conversation highlights the emergence of an active online community centered around the Physics Lab software, with a dynamic interplay between users and developers.

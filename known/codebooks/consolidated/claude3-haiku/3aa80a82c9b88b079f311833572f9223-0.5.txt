You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
The draft merging plan covers the key aspects of the research question, including community dynamics, knowledge co-construction, platform design and support, and theoretical perspectives. The categories are well-defined and concise.

One potential improvement is to consider merging "requests for administrative support" and "online communication strategies" into a single category, as they seem closely related to platform design and support.

Additionally, the "Theoretical Perspectives" category could be expanded to include more aspects of the research context, such as human-computer interaction and participatory design.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

24.
Label: demonstrating educational relevance
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

25.
Label: praise software design
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

26.
Label: provide positive reinforcement
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

27.
Label: confirms action
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

28.
Label: advises categorization
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

29.
Label: asking for permission to ask that question
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

30.
Label: direct communication
Quotes:

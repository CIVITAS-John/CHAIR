You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
Tags should be descriptive of the event and its context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary tags: avatar customization; user profile management; community norms
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary tags: platform inquiry; pc version availability
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary tags: avatar upload; designer support; user inquiry
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary tags: user identity; teacher role; community demographics
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: 
For this conversation, I plan to analyze the emergence of the online community around Physics Lab. I will examine the interactions between designers and users, identifying the themes related to community building, user engagement, and participatory design. I will also explore how the designers' responses shape the community norms and user expectations. Guiding questions include: How do designers facilitate user engagement and participation? What are the users' expectations from the Physics Lab platform? How do designers balance user requests with their development plan?

10. user feedback; participatory design; development prioritization
11. appreciation; community gratitude
12. platform inquiry; pc version availability; interactive whiteboard
13. platform navigation; group files; user support

Summary: 
The conversation starts with the designers engaging with users, sharing images and discussing avatar customization. The users begin to ask questions about the PC version and provide feedback on the platform. One user, a teacher, requests features for mechanical waves and optical experiments, which the designer acknowledges but prioritizes other development tasks. The conversation highlights the designers' efforts to engage with users, gather feedback, and balance user requests with their development plan.

Notes: 
The designers seem to be actively engaging with users, responding to their queries and gathering feedback. The users are enthusiastic about the platform and provide suggestions for new features. The conversation reveals the importance of participatory design and user-centered development in shaping the Physics Lab community.

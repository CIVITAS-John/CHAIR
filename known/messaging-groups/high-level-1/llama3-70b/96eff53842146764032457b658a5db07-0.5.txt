Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label: A label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...
~~~
1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab online message group, with quotes from the conversation:

---
## Request for Features
Definition: Instances where users request new features or functionalities in Physics Lab.
- "Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference?"
- "it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments."
- (No third quote, as there is only one user request in this conversation)

---
## Prioritization
Definition: Instances where designers or developers prioritize tasks or features in Physics Lab.
- "We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts."
- (No second quote, as there is only one instance of prioritization)
- (No third quote, as there is only one instance of prioritization)

---
## Feedback Solicitation
Definition: Instances where designers or developers ask for user opinions or feedback in Physics Lab.
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything."
- (No second quote, as there is only one instance of feedback solicitation)
- (No third quote, as there is only one instance of feedback solicitation)

---
## Appreciation
Definition: Instances where users express gratitude or appreciation for the designers' or developers' work in Physics Lab.
- "Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work."
- (No second quote, as there is only one instance of appreciation)
- (No third quote, as there is only one instance of appreciation)

---
## Resource Inquiry
Definition: Instances where users ask about or seek resources related to Physics Lab.
- "Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?"
- "I saw the group files, thank you."
- (No third quote, as there are only two instances of resource inquiry)

---
## Update Announcement
Definition: Instances where designers or developers announce updates or changes to Physics Lab.
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate)."
- "The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component."
- (No third quote, as there are only two instances of update announcements)

---
## Visual Communication
Definition: Instances where designers or developers use images or emojis to communicate in Physics Lab.
- "[Image 2-14]"
- "[Emoji 2-12]"
- (No third quote, as there are only two instances of visual communication)

This codebook can help analyze the factors that contribute to the emergence of Physics Lab's online community, focusing on aspects such as user engagement, designer-user interaction, and community feedback.

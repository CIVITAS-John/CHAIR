You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary tags: user requirements; subject matter expertise; physics education; interactive simulations
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary tags: development prioritization; project management; electrical section; magnetism
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: user feedback; participatory design; community involvement; mechanics
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: user appreciation; designer appreciation; community gratitude
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary tags: platform availability; user inquiry; technology integration; pc platform; access
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary tags: resource sharing; community resources; group files; pc interactive whiteboard
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: For this conversation, I'll be looking at the interactions between users and designers, focusing on how the online community is emerging. I'll be exploring the themes of participatory design, user requirements, and community involvement. I'll also examine how the designers are prioritizing their development process and how users are responding to the design decisions.

Tags for each message:
1. user requirements; subject matter expertise; physics education; interactive simulations; community-driven design
2. development prioritization; project management; electrical section; magnetism; design roadmap
3. user feedback; participatory design; community involvement; mechanics; iterative design
4. user appreciation; designer appreciation; community gratitude; social norms
5. platform availability; user inquiry; technology integration; pc platform; access; user expectations
6. resource sharing; community resources; group files; pc interactive whiteboard; community engagement
7. visual communication; design iteration; interactive design
8. design iteration; simulation updates; component updates; ideal components
9. design iteration; simulation updates; component updates; power supply; ideal components

Summary: The conversation starts with a user requesting specific features for the Physics Lab, showcasing their subject matter expertise. The designer responds by outlining their development priorities, highlighting the importance of user feedback in the design process. The conversation then shifts to users expressing gratitude and inquiring about platform availability. The designer shares updates on the simulation, including changes to components and the power supply.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the designers are involving users in the design process, soliciting feedback and prioritizing features based on user requirements. The users, in turn, are demonstrating their expertise and appreciation for the designers' work. This participatory design approach seems to be fostering a sense of community and social norms within the online community.

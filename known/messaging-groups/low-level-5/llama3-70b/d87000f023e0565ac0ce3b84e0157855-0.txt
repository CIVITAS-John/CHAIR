You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (18 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
18. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: Thank you.
Preliminary phrases: expressing gratitude; showing appreciation; acknowledging support
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary phrases: encouraging open communication; promoting transparency; fostering trust
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary phrases: providing feedback; sharing experiences; evaluating usability; highlighting strengths
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary phrases: considering limitations; exploring workarounds; addressing compatibility issues
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary phrases: providing theoretical explanations; clarifying technical details; setting boundaries
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary phrases: announcing updates; providing release notes; managing expectations; promoting engagement
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

Thoughts: 
In this first round of coding, I plan to focus on understanding the interactions between the designers and users, identifying the key themes and concepts that emerge from their conversations. I will analyze the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, looking for instances of feedback, collaboration, and co-design. I will also pay attention to the designers' responses to user feedback, how they address technical issues, and how they prioritize features and updates.

Interpretation phrases for each item:

1. expressing gratitude; showing appreciation; acknowledging support
2. encouraging open communication; promoting transparency; fostering trust
3. providing feedback; sharing experiences; evaluating usability; highlighting strengths
4. considering limitations; exploring workarounds; addressing compatibility issues
5. providing theoretical explanations; clarifying technical details; setting boundaries
6. announcing updates; providing release notes; managing expectations; promoting engagement
7. listing new features; highlighting improvements; showcasing enhancements
8. suggesting new features; identifying user needs; advocating for accessibility
9. acknowledging feedback; committing to updates; setting timelines
10. proposing design solutions; considering user experience; thinking aloud
11. explaining technical details; clarifying design decisions; providing context
12. describing user interactions; explaining design limitations; highlighting constraints
13. sharing personal experiences; illustrating technical workarounds; showing resourcefulness
14. expressing agreement; showing understanding; acknowledging designer's perspective
15. suggesting new features; identifying user needs; advocating for convenience
16. committing to future updates; acknowledging user requests; prioritizing features
17. inquiring about technical infrastructure; understanding user context; assessing feasibility
18. explaining technical constraints; sharing institutional limitations; highlighting challenges

Summary: 
The conversation revolves around the users' experiences with Physics Lab, their feedback, and suggestions for improvement. The designers respond by acknowledging the feedback, explaining technical details, and committing to updates. The users appreciate the software's practicality and suggest new features, such as an exit button function and export capabilities. The designers consider these suggestions, provide explanations for their design decisions, and prioritize features for future updates.

Notes: 
It appears that the designers are open to user feedback and willing to collaborate with users to improve the software. The users are enthusiastic about the software and willing to provide constructive feedback. The conversation highlights the importance of considering user needs, technical limitations, and institutional constraints in the design process.

Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation involves discussions around creating a physics simulation app, with participants sharing knowledge, ideas for features like 3D Touch and avoiding intrusive ads. Payment methods and potential monetization strategies like ads are explored. There are instances of humor, banter, and community norm reinforcement like not tolerating intrusive ads. Some disagreement arises when a participant's age/student status is misunderstood, but it's resolved through clarification.
1. P2: What do you need ads for, @Designer 
2. Designer: Health...
3. Designer: Doing this requires hiring people...
4. P1: It's free.
5. Designer: Actually, it's similar to charging money, but if you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay...
6. P2: Oh.
7. Designer: Do more of it.
8. Designer: There are some other ways as well.
9. P8: The points wall is okay.
10. P8: @Designer I think it's okay.
11. P14: I also think it's great.
12. Designer: Actually, you can learn that mini program.
13. Designer: Creating questions, reviewing questions, and answering questions.
14. P14: What do you mean?
15. P14: [Image]
16. P17: Brain Out.
17. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
18. P18: Just downloaded it.

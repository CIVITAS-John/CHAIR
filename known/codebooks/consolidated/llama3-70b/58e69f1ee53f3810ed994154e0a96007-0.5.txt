You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: providing guidance, feature guidance
- Designer or user provides guidance or clarification on a specific topic or feature.
- Designer guides users on how to use a specific feature or function, or users seek guidance on how to use a feature or functionality.

2.
Concepts: feedback acknowledgement, user request acknowledgment
- Designer accepts or acknowledges user input or feedback.
- Designers acknowledge or respond to user requests or suggestions.

3.
Concepts: future direction, future development planning
- A designer expresses interest or consideration for future developments or directions in the Physics Lab online community.
- Designer outlines or shares plans for future development or updates in the Physics Lab online community.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: providing guidance, feature guidance
Relationship: Inclusion (providing guidance is a broader concept that includes feature guidance)
Criteria: Designer or user provides clarification or direction on a specific topic or feature, or user seeks guidance on how to use a feature or functionality.
Label: Guidance Provision

2.
Concepts: feedback acknowledgement, user request acknowledgment
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts refer to designer's response to user input)
Criteria: Designer accepts, acknowledges, or responds to user input, feedback, or suggestions.
Label: User Input Acknowledgement

3.
Concepts: future direction, future development planning
Relationship: Inclusion (future direction is a broader concept that includes future development planning)
Criteria: Designer expresses interest, consideration, or shares plans for future developments or updates in the Physics Lab online community.
Label: Future Development Planning

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: share anecdotal evidence; provide practical tips for navigating software; encourage problem solving through shared experiences
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: affirm understanding; engage with the designer's comments; strengthen collaborative dialogue within the community
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: propose new features; emphasize practicality for educational settings; advocate for user centered design enhancements
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: confirm intention to implement suggestions; demonstrate responsiveness to user needs; build trust through commitment
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquire about infrastructure; assess technical limitations; facilitate discussions on software requirements
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: recount past experiences; highlight security concerns; illustrate impact of external events on technology use in education
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

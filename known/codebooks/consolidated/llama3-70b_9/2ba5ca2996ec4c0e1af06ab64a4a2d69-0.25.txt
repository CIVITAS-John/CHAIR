You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the positive aspects of AI-driven interfaces, specifically the clarity and understandability of AI responses and explanations.
Criteria: Participants appreciate AI-driven interfaces that provide clear and comprehensible responses and explanations.
Phrase: Appreciating clear AI responses

2.
Concepts: expressing frustration with ai-driven interfaces, expressing frustration with ai's error fixing limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the negative emotions and experiences of participants when interacting with AI-driven interfaces, specifically the limitations and errors of AI.

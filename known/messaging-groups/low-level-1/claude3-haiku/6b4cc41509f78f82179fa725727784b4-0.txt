Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation covers various topics related to physics and chemistry, including the use of equipment and software in labs, as well as exam-related considerations. The participants discuss the pros and cons of different lab equipment, the availability of chemistry software, and the importance of focusing on exams. The conversation also includes some social interactions, such as tagging, agreement, and acknowledgment.
1. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
2. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
3. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
4. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
5. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
6. P11: Hey, good idea.
7. P2: Hehe.
8. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
9. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
10. Designer: The question is,
11. Designer: Where does the light come from?
12. P11: What about light?
13. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
14. P2: Touch it with your hand.
15. P14: I think there's no problem.
16. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
17. P2: And a small light.
18. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
19. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
20. P2: ï¼Ÿ
21. P14: [Image]
22. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
23. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
24. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
25. P1: Let's put up some ads.
26. Designer: Hmm.
27. P14: 
28. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
29. Designer: Oh.
30. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).

Summary: The conversation covers various topics related to physics and chemistry, including the use of equipment and software in labs, as well as exam-related considerations. The participants discuss the pros and cons of different lab equipment, the availability of chemistry software, and the importance of focusing on exams. The conversation also includes some social interactions, such as tagging, agreement, and acknowledgment.

Notes: The conversation does not provide much insight into the emergence of the online community. The messages are mostly focused on technical discussions and some social interactions, but there is no clear indication of how the community was formed or how it evolved over time. More context would be needed to understand the community's development.

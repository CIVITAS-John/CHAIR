You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary phrases: announcing upcoming feature changes; improving simulation fidelity; demonstrating responsiveness to user needs; keeping the community informed of developments
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary phrases: introducing new component functionalities; expanding simulation capabilities; addressing diverse user requirements; showcasing ongoing product improvement
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary phrases: soliciting user feedback; encouraging community participation in development; demonstrating openness to user input; fostering collaborative design process
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary phrases: seeking guidance on software usage; engaging with the community for support; demonstrating interest in pc version; revealing potential usability issues
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary phrases: providing technical support; clarifying system requirements; managing user expectations; demonstrating awareness of compatibility issues
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

Summary: This conversation showcases the early stages of the Physics Lab online community's development. Designers are actively engaging with users, announcing updates, and soliciting feedback. Users are seeking support, providing feedback, and expressing appreciation for the software. The interaction reveals a collaborative atmosphere where designers are responsive to user needs and open to suggestions. Technical issues, particularly around system compatibility, are being addressed openly. The community seems to value practicality, user-friendliness, and open communication.

Notes: 
- The designers appear to be taking a participatory design approach, actively involving users in the development process.
- There's a focus on creating a user-friendly, practical tool rather than a comprehensive but complex one.
- The community seems to be in an early stage, with designers still working on basic compatibility issues and feature improvements.
- There's an emphasis on open, direct communication between users and designers.
- The positive feedback from users suggests that the software is meeting a real need in the education sector.
- Compatibility with older systems appears to be a significant challenge, potentially limiting adoption in some educational settings.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: encountering limitations, experience frustration with ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are causally related, where encountering limitations leads to experiencing frustration.
Criteria: Participants encounter limitations and experience frustration when using AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Encounter and feel frustrated with AI limitations.

2.
Concepts: novice (negative), discusses risks for novices
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected, as the negative aspect of novices is highlighted by discussing the risks they face.
Criteria: Participants discuss the risks or limitations that novices or less experienced users may encounter when using AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Discuss risks for novices.

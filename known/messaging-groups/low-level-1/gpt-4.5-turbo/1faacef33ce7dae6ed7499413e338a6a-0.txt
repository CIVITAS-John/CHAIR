You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken.
8. P14: [Image]
9. P14: What do you mean?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top. 233333
11. P14: The condensed liquid won't flow back, right?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh, I see.
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year.
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be about electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay.
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?

Summary: The conversation in the Physics Lab's online messaging group showcases a blend of technical discussions about chemistry and physics, interspersed with social interactions such as agreements, acknowledgments, and personal insights. Participants engage in sharing resources, asking questions, and providing explanations, which indicates a collaborative and supportive environment. The emergence of the community seems to be facilitated by a shared interest in scientific topics and a willingness to help and educate each other.

Notes: The tags reveal a pattern of active engagement and support among participants, with frequent exchanges of information and social affirmations (+1, acknowledgment). The community appears to be knowledge-driven but also supportive, with members stepping in to clarify doubts and share insights. The mix of technical and social interactions suggests a well-rounded community dynamic. The conversation also hints at the use of humor and casual language, which may contribute to a more relaxed and inclusive community atmosphere.

Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
Preliminary tags: chemical usage question; educational inquiry; community interaction
6. P2: +1
Preliminary tags: agreement; community support; simple confirmation
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 1-202]
9. P14: How do you say it?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, they heat up quickly and save materials. But this is also fine, if you're a bit extravagant, you can cover a fish tank and connect a tube ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Won't the condensed liquid flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid has already been heated during reflux, making it less likely to break
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry things, probably won't be able to touch it before the second half of the year..
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be exactly the same as in the books, although during exams...
20. P1: There isn't any relatively realistic chemistry software at the moment
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was okay
22. Designer: But even the gods of organic chemistry can't solve it
23. Designer: So if you want to do it, you still have to consider it from the exam perspective
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section on electricity will have it, such as charged operations)
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a larger amount of computation...
32. P1: If you have the ability to make a comprehensive and free one, it should be very popular
33. P2: If the CPU is bad, it's game over
34. P11: Adding what you said, it wouldn't be "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
35. P1: It's a series of lab courses
36. P11: Hey, good idea
37. P2: Hehe
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is very annoying?
39. P2: @Designer Can you add a light sensor?
40. Designer: The problem is
41. Designer: Where does the light come from
42. P11: What about the light
43. Designer: Are you using a small bulb to illuminate the photoresistor?
44. P2: Tap with your hand
45. P14: I think there's no problem
46. Designer: Isn't that just a variable resistor, except the curve is different (â€¦â€¦)
47. P2: And a small light
48. Designer: Micro-payment maybe...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 1-245]
52. Designer: We'll see
53. Designer: If you don't have money, you can also click on ads
54. Designer: It's the approach of a conscientious game
55. P1: Put up ads
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: If you tap and release, it won't conduct electricity
58. Designer: Oh
59. Designer: Forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (â€¦â€¦)
60. P11: ðŸ˜‚
61. P11: Just about to say
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but that you don't know how to pay
63. P11: It can also be adapted to 3D touch
64. Designer: Just charge directly through the app store?

Thoughts: Analyzing this conversation involves understanding how community interactions facilitate collective learning and how the design of the platform supports or hinders this process. From a learning sciences perspective, the exchange of technical knowledge and troubleshooting ideas reflects situated learning and community of practice theories. In human-computer interaction, the focus would be on how the design and features of the platform (e.g., image sharing, direct tagging) enable or limit user engagement and interaction. Participatory design aspects are evident in how users contribute ideas for new features and directly interact with the Designer, suggesting a co-design or user-centered design approach.

The designer's participation highlights a participatory design approach, considering user feedback for future updates and features.

Notes: The community's emergent behavior suggests a blend of peer learning and collaborative problem-solving. The interaction with the designer shows an openness to participatory design but also reveals constraints like resource allocation and technical feasibility. Further analysis could explore how these interactions influence user satisfaction and continuous engagement with the platform.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. P4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. P4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer: We are working on this part
9. P4234: Left side
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Make it simpler...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer: So, use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer: The update is quite large...

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction between the Designer and users (P4232 and P4234) in the Physics Lab's online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation revolves around the Designer's plans to create a function for simulated experiment assessment, specifically discussing the design of circuit diagrams and seeking feedback from the community.

* Plan
The analysis will explore how the Designer engages with the community, solicits feedback, and incorporates user input into the design process. We will examine the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to understand how the online community emerges and shapes the development of the Physics Lab.

# Community Engagement
## Seeking Feedback
Definition: Instances where the Designer asks for opinions or input from the community.

- "Thank you all for your support."

## Providing Updates
Definition: Instances where the Designer shares information about the development process or upcoming changes.
- "There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend."
- "The update is quite large..."
- "We are working on this part"

# Design Decisions
## Design Options
Definition: Instances where design alternatives are discussed or presented.
- "This one, right? [Image 2-92]"
- "Left side or right side"
- "But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing"

## Design Rationale
Definition: Instances where the Designer explains the reasoning behind design choices.
- "This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results"

# User Input
## Agreement
Definition: Instances where users express agreement or support for the Designer's ideas.
- "This idea is really good"

## Suggestions
Definition: Instances where users provide suggestions or opinions on the design.
- "Yes, the common one is still the old style"
- "But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing"
- "Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]"

# Development Process
## Task Management
Definition: Instances where the Designer mentions tasks or milestones in the development process.

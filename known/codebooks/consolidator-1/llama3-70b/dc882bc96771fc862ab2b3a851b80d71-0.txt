You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Did you make categories too large?
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
Upon reviewing the draft merging plan, I noticed that the "Miscellaneous" category is quite large and may be too broad. It would be beneficial to break it down into smaller categories.

Additionally, some categories may be too specific, such as "Technical Environment" and "Design and Technology". These categories could be merged with other categories to create more comprehensive categories.

There are opportunities to merge more categories, such as "Community Aspects" and "Social Dynamics", as they seem to overlap.

The naming of the categories seems accurate, but some categories may benefit from more descriptive names.

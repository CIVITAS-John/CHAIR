Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
4. User-4233: How to download?
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
6. Designer-2: Group sharing.
7. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

* Summary
The conversation involves users and designers discussing updates and features of Physics Lab, an online platform. The designers inform users about the upcoming release in the Apple market, share plans for new features and updates, and encourage users to suggest additional components or characteristics for inclusion in the platform.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, consider the following theoretical angles:
1. Learning Sciences: Explore how users' teaching experiences (like User-4232's transition from high school to middle school) might influence their interactions with educational tools like Physics Lab.
2. Human-Computer Interaction: Examine how users engage with the platform, such as asking for download instructions, using emojis, and seeking clarification.
3. Participatory Design: Investigate how designers involve users in the development process, such as through group sharing, soliciting feedback on features, and updating users on upcoming changes.

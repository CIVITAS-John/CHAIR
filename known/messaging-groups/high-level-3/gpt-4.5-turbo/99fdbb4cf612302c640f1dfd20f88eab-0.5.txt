You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

* Summary
In this conversation, users and designers of the Physics Lab online platform interact regarding updates and functionalities of the Physics Lab software. Users inquire about how to access and use specific versions of the software, while designers provide information about upcoming updates and request feedback.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, the focus will be on how the interaction between users and designers contributes to the community's development and engagement. From the perspective of learning sciences, the emphasis will be on understanding how these interactions facilitate learning and problem-solving. Human-computer interaction (HCI) analysis will focus on usability and accessibility issues raised by the users, and how the designers address these. Participatory design aspects will be explored by examining how user feedback is solicited and incorporated into the design process, enhancing user involvement and satisfaction. Key questions include: How do designers respond to user inquiries and feedback? What learning opportunities are presented through these interactions? How do these exchanges influence the design and functionality of the platform?

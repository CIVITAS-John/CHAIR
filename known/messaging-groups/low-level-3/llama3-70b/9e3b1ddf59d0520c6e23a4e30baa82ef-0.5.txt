You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify low-level descriptive codes for each message.
Codes should attempt to interpret events, actors, and intents.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary codes: * user background sharing; teacher's experience expression
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
Preliminary codes: * product update announcement; development progress sharing
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
Preliminary codes: * social courtesy expression; apology
4. User-4233: How to download?
Preliminary codes: * technical inquiry; user support request
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary codes: * social courtesy expression; apology
6. Designer-2: Group sharing.
Preliminary codes: * feature suggestion; collaboration functionality discussion
7. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

Thoughts: In this conversation, I plan to analyze the emergence of the online community of Physics Lab from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will explore how the designers and users interact, share information, and negotiate meanings. I will examine the language and tone used by the designers and users to understand their relationships and intentions. Guiding questions: How do the designers facilitate the community's growth? How do users respond to the designers' updates and requests?

Codes for each message:

    * emotional expression; enthusiasm; community building

Summary: The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community, where designers and users interact, share information, and collaborate. The designers provide updates on the product's development, offer technical support, and engage with users. Users share their backgrounds, ask questions, and express emotions. The tone is polite, empathetic, and collaborative, indicating a sense of community building.

Notes: The designers seem to prioritize transparency, empathy, and community engagement, which may contribute to the emergence of the online community. Users are active participants, seeking guidance and expressing emotions. The use of emojis and apologies suggests a friendly and polite atmosphere. Hypothesis: The designers' participatory design approach and the users' active engagement may foster a sense of community and contribute to the emergence of the online community.

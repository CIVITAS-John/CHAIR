You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...

10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Hello
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: There will be more people here after the official version is announced.
5. Designer: Probably because the teacher finds it annoying to talk too much ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image 6]
8. P5: ðŸ˜‚ Just to see if there are any good designs to draw inspiration from
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: Like a microcomputer

Thoughts: For this conversation, I'll focus on identifying the initial interactions and tone-setting between the users and the Designer. I'll explore how the Designer's responses might be influencing the community's emergence. I'll also look for any hints about the Designer's expectations and goals for the online community. Guiding questions: How do the users and Designer establish their roles and relationships? What kind of tone is being set in these initial interactions?

Tags for each message:
1. Initial reaction; uncertainty
2. Greeting; introduction
3. Response; acknowledgement
4. Future expectations; community growth
5. Humor; teacher's perspective
6. Greeting; repetition
7. Image sharing; unclear context
8. Inspiration seeking; design interest
9. Clarification; design criteria
10. Technical reference; microcomputer

Summary: The conversation starts with an uncertain reaction from P1, followed by greetings from P2 and the Designer. The Designer shares their expectations for the community's growth and pokes fun at the teacher's potential annoyance. The conversation then shifts to image sharing, design inspiration, and a technical reference. The tone is casual, with a touch of humor.

Notes: The Designer seems to be setting a relaxed tone, which might be influencing the community's emergence. The mention of the teacher and the official version announcement suggests that there's an external context that's not yet fully explained. The design-related comments could indicate that the community will focus on design and technical aspects.

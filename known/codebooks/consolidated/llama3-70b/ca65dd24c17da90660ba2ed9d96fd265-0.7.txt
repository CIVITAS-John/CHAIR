You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: question for access
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

2.
Label: self-help
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

3.
Label: explain situation
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

4.
Label: followup
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- User: Win7 should be fine.

5.
Label: inviting more questions
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

6.
Label: open up plans
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

7.
Label: explain development process
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

8.
Label: acceptance of request
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

9.
Label: design question
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

10.
Label: design discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* communication approach challenges
* community building
* contextual factors
* design principles
* emotional responses
* human-computer interaction
* identity formation
* infrastructure development
* knowledge sharing
* learning experience outcomes
* learning processes
* participatory design
* physics learning context
* physics problem solving
* risk and safety
* self-regulated learning
* social interactions
* technical discussion

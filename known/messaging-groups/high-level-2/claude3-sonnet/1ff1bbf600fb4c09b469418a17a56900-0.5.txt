Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

* Summary
This conversation appears to be a discussion among members of an online community related to Physics Lab, where they are working on some kind of experiment or project involving wiring and data display. The conversation revolves around questions about how to make the setup work, how to connect components, and how to display data. Members are sharing images of their setups and seeking guidance from others.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the lens of learning sciences, we could look for evidence of collaborative learning, knowledge sharing, and scaffolding among community members. From a human-computer interaction perspective, we could examine how the online platform facilitates or hinders their ability to communicate and collaborate on the project. Through a participatory design lens, we could investigate how the community members are actively shaping the project and contributing to its design.

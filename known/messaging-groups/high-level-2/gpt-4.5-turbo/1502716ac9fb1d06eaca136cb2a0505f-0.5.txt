Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

* Summary
The conversation in the Physics Lab's online message group involves multiple participants discussing aspects of a physics experiment setup. The discussion includes queries about adding new components, how to connect them, and operational instructions, with visual aids shared as images.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction, it is essential to consider the theoretical frameworks of learning sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and participatory design. From the learning sciences perspective, the focus will be on collaborative learning and knowledge construction. For HCI, the emphasis will be on the usability of the shared content and tools (e.g., images as instructional aids) and how they facilitate understanding and interaction. In participatory design, the analysis will look at how community members contribute to the evolving design and understanding of the experiment setup. Key questions include: How do participants negotiate understanding and co-construct knowledge? How do the images and text shared in the group support or hinder this process? How does the interaction reflect principles of participatory design, such as inclusivity and responsiveness to user feedback?

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Preliminary tags: politeness; social norms
6. P8: Group sharing.
Preliminary tags: feature suggestion; collaboration tool
7. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

Thoughts: In this conversation, I plan to explore how the Physics Lab online community emerged through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will analyze the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, considering the roles of the designer, teachers, and users in shaping the online community. Guiding questions include: How do the designer's updates and responses influence the community's dynamics? How do users' suggestions and queries impact the development of Physics Lab? What social norms and communication styles emerge in this online community?

Tags for each message:

1. P4232: teacher profile; educational background; teaching experience
2. Designer: software development; version control; release management; Apple market
3. Designer: apology; communication style; tone; politeness
4. P4233: technical support; user query; download instructions
5. P4233: politeness; social norms; etiquette
6. P8: feature request; collaboration tool; group sharing
7. Designer: technical support; resource sharing; Windows download
8. Designer: development roadmap; feature prioritization; community engagement; feedback mechanism
9. P4234: emotional expression; emoji usage; social presence
10. P4232: emotional expression; emoji usage; social presence

Summary: The conversation starts with P4232 introducing himself as a teacher with experience in high school and middle school. The designer responds with updates on the software, including a new version and a timeline for release. The conversation then shifts to user queries, with P4233 asking about downloading and P8 suggesting a new feature. The designer responds to these queries, providing technical support and outlining the development roadmap. The conversation also includes instances of politeness, apology, and emotional expression through emojis.

Notes: The conversation reveals the designer's efforts to engage with the community, respond to user queries, and prioritize features. The users, in turn, are interested in the software's development and willing to provide feedback. The community's social norms and communication styles are shaped by the designer's tone and the users' politeness.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: iterative development
- Instances where designers discuss updates, new features, or bug fixes.
- The process of repeatedly refining and improving a product based on feedback and testing.
- The process of continuously improving the product based on feedback and testing.
- Instances where the design process is described as iterative, with ongoing optimizations and updates.

2.
Concepts: update confirmation
- A user confirms that they have updated the software or app.
- Confirm update completion involves verifying that an update has been successfully implemented or completed.

3.
Concepts: promote community engagement
- Instances where members of the community actively participate in discussions, ask questions, or provide feedback.
- Instances where users or designers engage in discussions that foster community interaction and participation.
- Active participation and interaction among community members, including both users and designers.
- Efforts made by designers to actively involve and communicate with the user community.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: iterative development
Relationship: The concepts are related as they all describe the process of refining and improving a product through repeated cycles of feedback, testing, and refinement.
Criteria: Designers engage in a cyclical process of refinement, incorporating feedback and testing to improve the product.
Phrase: Refine through iteration

2.
Concepts: update confirmation
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the process of verifying that an update has been successfully implemented.
Criteria: Users confirm that an update has been successfully implemented or completed.
Phrase: Confirm update completion

3.
Concepts: promote community engagement
Relationship: The concepts are related as they all describe efforts to encourage active participation and interaction among community members.
Criteria: Designers and users engage in discussions, provide feedback, and participate in activities that foster community interaction.
Phrase: Foster community engagement

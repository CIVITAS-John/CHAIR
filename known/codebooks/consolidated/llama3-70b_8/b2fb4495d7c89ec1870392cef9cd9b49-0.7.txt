You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: suggests alternative solutions
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

2.
Label: suggesting they feel their input is valued
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

3.
Label: there's a balance between designer led development and user input
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

4.
Label: demonstrating domain expertise
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

5.
Label: manage expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

6.
Label: offering technical support
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

7.
Label: explaining development complexity
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

8.
Label: providing technical insight
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

9.
Label: communicating development timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

10.
Label: expressing frustration with current avatar
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

11.
Label: software update
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

12.
Label: seeking confirmation or correction
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

13.
Label: praising the software as practical and user friendly
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

14.
Label: seeks clarity on software usage
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

15.
Label: use emoji for engagement
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

16.
Label: setting development roadmap
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

17.
Label: the designers are focusing on both immediate improvements and long term stability
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

18.
Label: identifies practical use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

19.
Label: cautions against comprehensiveness
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

20.
Label: fosters a positive and appreciative atmosphere
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

21.
Label: inquiring about infrastructure
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

22.
Label: announcing the removal of dry batteries as ideal components
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

23.
Label: validating designer's idea
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

24.
Label: announcing software update
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: appreciating ai's clarification, appreciating comprehensible ai responses
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both describe the positive aspects of AI responses, specifically the clarity and comprehensibility of the responses.
Criteria: Participants appreciate AI's ability to provide clear and understandable responses that clarify errors and facilitate debugging.
Phrase: Appreciating AI's clarifying responses.

2.
Concepts: user frustration, expressing frustration with ai's error resolution
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both describe the negative emotions and reactions of participants when AI fails to resolve errors effectively.
Criteria: Participants experience and express frustration when AI fails to accurately identify or fix errors in their code.
Phrase: Expressing frustration with AI's error resolution.

3.
Concepts: fixing ai-generated code errors, identifying ai-generated code errors
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both describe the actions taken by participants to address errors in AI-generated code, with identifying errors being a necessary step before fixing them.
Criteria: Participants identify and fix errors in AI-generated code through review and interpretation.
Phrase: Fixing AI-generated code errors.

4.
Concepts: evaluating ai-generated code, exercising personal judgment with ai-generated code
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both describe the critical thinking and evaluation processes participants engage in when working with AI-generated code.
Criteria: Participants critically evaluate AI-generated code, exercising their personal judgment to assess its quality and relevance.
Phrase: Evaluating AI-generated code critically.

5.
Concepts: writing code manually with ai guidance, using ai-generated code as a reference
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both describe the ways in which participants use AI-generated code as a resource to support their own coding activities.
Criteria: Participants use AI-generated code as a reference or guide to inform their manual coding efforts.
Phrase: Using AI-generated code as a reference.

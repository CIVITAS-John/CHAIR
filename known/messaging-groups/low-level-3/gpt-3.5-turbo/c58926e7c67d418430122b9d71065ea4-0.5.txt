You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
9. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
Preliminary tags: content request; physics demonstrations; optical experiments
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
Preliminary tags: content development priorities; planning
3. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: community feedback; memory retention
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; community support
5. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
Preliminary tags: download inquiry; pc version; interactive whiteboard version
6. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
Preliminary tags: resource location; gratitude
7. Designer: [Image 14]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: In analyzing the conversation about Physics Lab's online community emergence, it is important to consider the content requests made by users, the priorities set by the designer, the feedback and opinions gathered from the community, resource inquiries, and updates on the platform's features and components. By identifying these aspects, we can gain insights into how the community is shaping the development of Physics Lab.

Tags for each message:
1. content request; physics demonstrations; optical experiments
2. content development priorities; planning
3. community feedback; memory retention
4. appreciation; community support
5. download inquiry; pc version; interactive whiteboard version
6. resource location; gratitude
7. visual update
8. component update; simulation feature
9. equipment update; ideal components

Summary: The conversation revolves around users' content requests for physics demonstrations and optical experiments, the designer's prioritization of content development, gathering feedback from the community before starting new sections, expressions of gratitude and support, inquiries about downloading specific versions of Physics Lab, locating resources within the group, updates on visual elements, changes in component simulation features, and updates on equipment components.

Notes: The community seems actively engaged in providing feedback and making content requests, while the designer is responsive to these inputs and adjusts priorities accordingly. The platform updates indicate a continuous effort to enhance user experience and educational value.

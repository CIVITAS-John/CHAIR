You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: inquired about download options
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

2.
Label: emphasize quality of auto generated layout
Quotes:

3.
Label: express agreement with designerâ€™s insights
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

4.
Label: detail simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

5.
Label: prioritize user access to different platforms
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

6.
Label: user 4235 inquires about user manual
Quotes:

7.
Label: explain project prioritization
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

8.
Label: demonstrated responsiveness
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
- Designer: There will be.

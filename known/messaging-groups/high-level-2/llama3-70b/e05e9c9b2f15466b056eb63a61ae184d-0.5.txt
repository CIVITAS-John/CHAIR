Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P5: I just need logic gates to make a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
2. P6: [Image 1-14]
3. P6: [Image 1-15]
4. P7: How to play?
5. Designer: Do experiments for fun. ðŸ˜‚
6. P8: Why did you suddenly add a wave?
7. P7: Oh oh
8. P2: [Image 1-20]
9. P2: [Image 1-21]
10. P7: 66

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab's online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with P5 expressing a need for logic gates to make a calculator without using Minecraft. P6 shares images, and P7 asks how to play. The Designer intervenes, suggesting doing experiments for fun. The conversation then shifts to P8 questioning the addition of a wave, and P7 responds with "Oh oh". P2 shares more images, and P7 ends with a numerical response, "66".

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will draw on theories from learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. We will examine the conversation for indicators of community emergence, such as shared goals, social norms, and collective identity. We will also investigate how the Designer's intervention influences the conversation and how participants respond to each other's contributions. Guiding questions include: How do participants negotiate meaning and understanding in this online space? How do they use visual and textual cues to communicate? What role does the Designer play in shaping the conversation?

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* User feedback
* Direct communication
=> Communication dynamics

* Knowledge sharing
* Subject-specific discussions
=> Learning support

* Learning progression
* Learning outcomes
=> Learning sciences

* Technology-focused discussions
* Technology integration
=> Technology discourse

* Interaction design
* User interface design
=> Interface design

* Science education
* Educational context
=> Educational aspects

* Community dynamics analysis
* Social interaction
=> Community interaction

* Emotional expression
* Learning and engagement
=> User engagement

# Reflection
- More categories for merging could include "Laboratory safety" and "Ethical considerations" into a broader category like "Safety and ethics."
- The category "Precision and capabilities" could be split as it might not fit well with other categories.
- The naming of the merged categories seems accurate and aligned with the research context. 

# Final Merging
* Laboratory safety
* Ethical considerations
=> Safety and ethics

* Precision and capabilities
=> Specialized skills

* Community dynamics analysis
* Social interaction
=> Community interaction

* Emotional expression
* Learning and engagement
=> User engagement

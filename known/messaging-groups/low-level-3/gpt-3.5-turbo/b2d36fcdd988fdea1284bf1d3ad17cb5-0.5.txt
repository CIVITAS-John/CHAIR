You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (24 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
24. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

15. P11: [Image 45]
16. P11: The result is not as expected.
17. P11: I'm not sure if it's a circuit issue or a software bug. Seeking advice.
18. P11: [Image 48]
19. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
20. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
21. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits. So I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know. So please enlighten me in the future if I don't understand. Thank you.
22. P4: Have you updated it?
23. P11: It's not ideal...
24. P11: I will consider the impedance.

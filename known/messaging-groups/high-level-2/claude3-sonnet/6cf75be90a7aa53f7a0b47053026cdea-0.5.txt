Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

3. P11: It means "me too".
4. P13: +1 means the same opinion
5. P13: emmmm
6. P13: You can search on Baidu
7. P10: Oh, I see, thank you.
8. P2: +1
9. P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for.

* Summary
This conversation is about the meaning of the phrase "+1" used in online discussions. P10 asks what it means, and P11 and P13 explain that it means "me too" or expressing agreement with a previous opinion. P13 suggests searching on Baidu (a Chinese search engine) for more information. P2 then uses "+1" to agree with the explanations given. P14 makes an unrelated comment about paying for things in a beaker, and P17 and P4 respond with unrelated comments as well.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Knowledge sharing and collaborative learning: How do participants exchange knowledge and build understanding together?
2. Online community norms and practices: What norms and practices are being established or reinforced in this interaction?
3. User experience and interface design: How does the interface or platform shape the way participants interact and communicate?
4. Participatory design: How are participants co-creating meaning and shaping the community through their interactions?

# Knowledge sharing and collaborative learning
## Asking for clarification
Definition: Participants ask for clarification or additional information to better understand a concept or practice.
- P10: What does "+1" mean?
- P13: emmmm
- P13: You can search on Baidu

## Providing explanations
Definition: Participants provide explanations or definitions to help others understand a concept or practice.
- P11: It means "me too".
- P13: +1 means the same opinion

## Confirming understanding
Definition: Participants confirm or acknowledge that they have understood an explanation or concept.
- P10: Oh, I see, thank you.

# Online community norms and practices
## Using community-specific language
Definition: Participants use language or phrases that are specific to the online community, such as "+1" in this case.
- P16: ＋1
- P2: +1

## Referencing external resources
Definition: Participants suggest or refer to external resources, such as search engines or websites, for additional information.
- P13: You can search on Baidu

# User experience and interface design
## Unrelated or off-topic comments
Definition: Participants make comments that are unrelated or off-topic to the main conversation, which could be influenced by the interface design or user experience.
- P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for.
- P17: I'm just looking.
- P4: No problem.

# Participatory design
## Co-creating meaning
Definition: Participants collaboratively construct meaning and understanding through their interactions and contributions.
- The collective effort of P10, P11, and P13 to explain and understand the meaning of "+1" can be seen as co-creating meaning within the community.

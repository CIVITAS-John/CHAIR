You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
Upon reviewing the draft merging plan, I identify the following:

* Categories 1, 15, and 24 can be merged into "Learning and Education" as they all relate to learning and educational aspects.
* Categories 2, 6, and 22 can be merged into "Technical Knowledge and Practices" as they all relate to technical aspects of the online community.
* Categories 4 and 8 can be merged into "Technical Requirements" as they both relate to technical needs and aspects.
* Categories 5 and 12 can be merged into "Support and Feedback" as they both relate to guidance and communication.
* Categories 10 and 18 can be merged into "User Engagement" as they both relate to user motivation and information sharing.
* Categories 3 and 19 can be merged into "Sustainability and Context" as they both relate to contextual factors and sustainability.
* Categories 23, 26, and 25 can be merged into "Design and Interaction" as they all relate to design, technology, and human-computer interaction.
* Categories 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20, and 21 do not have an obvious merge, but some may be reconsidered in the final merging plan.

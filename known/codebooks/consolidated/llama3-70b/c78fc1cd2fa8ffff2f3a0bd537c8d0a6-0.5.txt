You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: express amusement
Quotes:
- Designer: ðŸ˜‚

2.
Label: feature discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

3.
Label: talk about limitation of the solution
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

4.
Label: provide access to new version
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

5.

- User: How do you use the PC version?

7.
Label: future design plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

8.

24.
Label: communication about progress and plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

25.
Label: mention ongoing research
Quotes:

26.
Label: resolution
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

27.
Label: provide rationale
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

28.
Label: enhance learning resources
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

29.
Label: confirm new version
Quotes:
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group

- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
- User: This idea is really good
- Designer: Hmm.

32.
Label: set user expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: discusses error resolution, notes error handling needs
- Participants discuss the ability of the LLM-driven interface to resolve errors or troubleshoot issues.
- Participants note the need for the AI to provide clear explanations and effective troubleshooting for errors.

2.
Concepts: critique ai limitations, experiences ai limitations
- Participants note or critique AI constraints or capacity limitations.
- Participants experience AI failure or variability in output, highlighting limitations.

3.
Concepts: netlogo context, utilizes ai for netlogo tasks
- The participant mentions NetLogo as a specific context or application for the LLM-driven interface.
- Participants use AI-driven interfaces for NetLogo tasks and syntax support.

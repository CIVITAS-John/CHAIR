You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
10. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P4232: I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary tags: educator background; teaching experience
2. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available on the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
Preliminary tags: software update; release information
3. Designer: Sorry for the midnight crowing :)
Preliminary tags: informal communication; apology
4. P4233: How to download?
Preliminary tags: software download inquiry
5. P4233: May I ask?
Preliminary tags: software download inquiry
6. P8: Group sharing.
Preliminary tags: collaboration; group sharing
7. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
9. P4234: [Emoji 56]
10. P4232: [Emoji 57][Emoji 57]

Thoughts: It seems like the community consists of educators, software users, and the Designer. The communication is a mix of discussions about teaching experiences, software updates, inquiries about software download, collaboration, and updates on the software features. It would be interesting to explore how the community interacts and evolves over time.

Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. educator background; teaching experience; career progression
2. software update; app release; platform availability
3. informal communication; apology; community interaction
4. software download inquiry; technical support
5. software download inquiry; permission to ask
6. collaboration; knowledge sharing; community engagement
7. software download instructions; group sharing
8. software feature update; community feedback; future development
9. emoji use; non-verbal communication
10. emoji use; non-verbal communication

Summary: The conversation in the Physics Lab online community revolves around discussions on teaching experiences, software updates, inquiries about software downloads, collaboration, and software feature updates. The Designer actively engages with the community, seeking feedback and suggestions for future developments.

Notes: The community seems supportive and actively involved in the software development process. The use of emojis adds a touch of informality and friendliness to the interactions. Further analysis could focus on how the community contributes to the evolution of Physics Lab and how the Designer incorporates user feedback into the development process.

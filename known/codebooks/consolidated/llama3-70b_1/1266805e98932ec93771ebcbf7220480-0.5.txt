You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

2.
Label: seek confirmation
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?
- User: Win7 should be fine.

3.
Label: committing to updates
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: There will be.

4.
Label: give a timeline of feature development
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

5.
Label: acknowledging user context

- User: Excuse me.

9.
Label: providing information about system compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.
- User: Win7 should be fine.

10.
Label: demonstrates user centered design
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

11.

12.
Label: acknowledge feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay.
- Designer: Hmm.

13.
Label: emphasizing benefits
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

14.
Label: reacting with multiple emojis
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

15.
Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

16.
Label: highlight usability need
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

17.
Label: building community rapport
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

18.
Label: acknowledging the optimization efforts

Label: reporting student engagement
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

20.
Label: showing empathy through anecdote
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

21.

Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

30.
Label: sharing release plans

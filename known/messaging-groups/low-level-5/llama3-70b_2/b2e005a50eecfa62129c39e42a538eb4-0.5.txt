You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (13 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
13. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: requesting technical assistance; seeking permission; expressing frustration
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about platform compatibility; seeking clarification
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: offering immediate solution; asking about user's role; establishing connection
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: identifying profession; claiming authority; building rapport
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: 
In this round of coding, I will focus on understanding the initial interactions between designers and users in the online community of Physics Lab. I will explore how designers respond to user requests, how users express their needs and expectations, and how the community begins to take shape. I will draw on theories from learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to inform my analysis.

Interpretation phrases for each item:

1. sharing visual content; initiating conversation;
2. seeking technical support; expressing frustration with current limitations; requesting permission to upload alternative content;
3. inquiring about platform compatibility; seeking clarification on availability;
4. offering immediate solution; asking about user's role; establishing connection; building rapport;
5. identifying profession; claiming authority; building rapport; establishing credibility;
6. sharing information; providing resources; setting community tone;
7. soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; fostering collaboration;
8. making a request; expressing enthusiasm; demonstrating expertise; suggesting features;
9. prioritizing tasks; managing expectations; setting development roadmap;
10. soliciting feedback; planning for future development; managing community expectations;
11. expressing gratitude; acknowledging effort; building community spirit;
12. seeking resources; expressing curiosity; using emoticons to set tone;
13. expressing gratitude; acknowledging receipt of resources; building community spirit;

Summary:
The conversation begins with designers and users exchanging information and resources, with designers seeking to understand user needs and users expressing their expectations and enthusiasm for Physics Lab. Designers respond to user requests, provide resources, and set the tone for the community. Users demonstrate their expertise and suggest features, while designers prioritize tasks and manage expectations.

Notes:
It appears that designers are actively seeking to engage with users and understand their needs, which may indicate a participatory design approach. Users are enthusiastic about Physics Lab and are willing to contribute their expertise, which may suggest a sense of community and shared ownership. The use of emoticons and expressions of gratitude may indicate a positive and supportive community tone.

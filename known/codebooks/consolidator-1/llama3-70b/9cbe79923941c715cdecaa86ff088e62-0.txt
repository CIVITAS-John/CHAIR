You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
Upon reviewing the draft merging plan, I noticed that:

* The category "Technical Challenges" has only 4 codes and might be merged with "Technical Challenges" and "Platform Functionality" into a broader category, e.g., "Technical Aspects".
* The category "Physics Context" might be merged with "Scientific Inquiry" to create a more comprehensive category, e.g., "Scientific Context".
* The category "Personal and Resource Planning" seems to combine two distinct aspects; it might be split into two separate categories, e.g., "Personal Background" and "Resource Planning".
* The category "Digital Competencies" is quite broad and might be split into two categories, e.g., "Digital Literacy" and "Technical Communication".

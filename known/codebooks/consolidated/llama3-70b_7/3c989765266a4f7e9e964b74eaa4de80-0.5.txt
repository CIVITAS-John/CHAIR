You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

- Participants envision AI's role in improving documentation and customized documentation.

3.
Concepts: highlights ai limitations, identifies ai misunderstandings
- Participants mention the possibility of AI hallucination, recognize AI's potential limitations, and identify inaccuracies or hallucinations in AI-generated code or feedback.
- Participants note discrepancies in AI understanding and identify misunderstandings with the LLM-driven interface and acknowledge gaps in AI output, such as missing code structures, and reflect on the gaps in conceptual understanding that hinder effective use of AI-driven interfaces.

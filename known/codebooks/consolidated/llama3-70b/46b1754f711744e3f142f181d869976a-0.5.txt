You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
More realistic 3D appearance for various meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeter and meter zeroing.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments
Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal/realistic modes.

# Special Tips
The Esc shortcut key will now minimize the window.
The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

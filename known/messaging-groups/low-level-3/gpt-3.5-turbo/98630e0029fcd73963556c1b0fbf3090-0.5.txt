You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (8 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
8. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P14: What do you mean?
Preliminary tags: seeking clarification; information request
2. P14: [Image 299]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
3. P17: Brain Out.
Preliminary tags: reference to external resource; potential learning tool
4. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
Preliminary tags: seeking guidance; information request
5. P18: Just downloaded it.
Preliminary tags: new user announcement; activity update
6. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10
Preliminary tags: resource sharing; external link provided
7. P6: When will it be updated?
8. P20: Why does that fuse keep burning out?

Thoughts: When analyzing the conversation from different angles, consider the interactions between the community members and how they contribute to the emergence of the Physics Lab online community. Look for patterns in information exchange, resource sharing, and requests for guidance. Pay attention to how new users are welcomed and supported in the community. Explore how questions and discussions around technical issues like fuses burning out contribute to knowledge sharing and problem-solving within the community.

Tags for each message:
1. seeking clarification; information request; community interaction
2. image sharing; visual aid
3. reference to external resource; potential learning tool; community engagement
4. seeking guidance; information request; technical support
5. new user announcement; activity update; community engagement
6. resource sharing; external link provided; community contribution
7. update inquiry; community engagement
8. technical issue discussion; troubleshooting; knowledge sharing

Summary: The conversation in the Physics Lab online community includes seeking clarification, sharing images, referencing external resources, seeking guidance on tool usage, announcing new user activity, sharing resources, inquiring about updates, and discussing technical issues like fuse burnouts. These interactions contribute to community engagement, knowledge sharing, and support among members.

Notes: The online community in Physics Lab seems to be actively engaged in sharing resources, supporting new users, and collaboratively troubleshooting technical issues. The interactions reflect a community that is focused on learning, problem-solving, and mutual support.

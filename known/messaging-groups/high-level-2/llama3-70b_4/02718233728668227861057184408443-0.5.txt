Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. P4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. P4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a user asking about uploading a high-definition avatar, which leads to the designer sharing the development plan and PC download address. A teacher then requests features for mechanical waves and optical experiments, and the designer responds by prioritizing the completion of the electrical section. Another user asks about downloading the PC version, and the designer directs them to the group files.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from multiple theoretical angles, we will examine the interaction through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do users negotiate meaning and coordinate actions in this online community? How do designers respond to user requests and prioritize features? What role do power dynamics and expertise play in shaping the conversation?

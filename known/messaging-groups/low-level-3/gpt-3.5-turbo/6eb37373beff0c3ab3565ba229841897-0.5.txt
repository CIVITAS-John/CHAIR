You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: When analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, consider how community dynamics are shaped through self-deprecation, agreement, and participation. Explore the role of community norms in shaping interactions, as well as the ways in which members engage with each other through explanations and seeking clarification. Additionally, consider the impact of external resources like search engines on community knowledge sharing and learning processes.

Tags for each message:
1. self-deprecation; community dynamics; exclusion
2. agreement; community engagement; social validation
3. community participation; agreement; social validation
4. community engagement; agreement; social validation
5. inquiry; seeking clarification; community norms; knowledge sharing
6. explanation; community norms; engagement; knowledge sharing
7. agreement; community norms; social validation
8. contemplation; uncertainty
9. external resources; knowledge sharing; learning processes

Summary: The conversation revolves around community dynamics, agreement, and participation within the Physics Lab online community. Members engage in social validation through expressions like "+1" to indicate agreement and solidarity. There is also a focus on community norms, with members seeking clarification and providing explanations to support knowledge sharing. The mention of using external resources like Baidu highlights the influence of external tools on learning processes within the community.

Notes: The community appears to have established norms around expressions like "+1" for agreement, indicating a shared understanding among members. The presence of self-deprecation and uncertainty may suggest underlying dynamics of hierarchy or power relations within the community. Further analysis could explore how these interactions contribute to the emergence and evolution of the Physics Lab online community.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
3. {Repeat the input 3}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 3}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 3}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 3}

Definitions for each code:

1. improvement promises, development promise
Relationship: Inclusive (development promise is a specific type of improvement promise)
Criteria: The quote expresses a commitment to enhance or create a feature or application.
Label: Development Commitments

2. compliment, positive feedback
Relationship: Parallel (compliment and positive feedback are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: The quote expresses praise, satisfaction, or admiration for a feature, system, or person.
Label: Appreciation

3. limitation discussion, limitation of the team
Relationship: Inclusive (limitation of the team is a specific type of limitation discussion)
Criteria: The quote acknowledges or explains constraints, limitations, or challenges faced by the development team or community.
Label: Limitations and Constraints

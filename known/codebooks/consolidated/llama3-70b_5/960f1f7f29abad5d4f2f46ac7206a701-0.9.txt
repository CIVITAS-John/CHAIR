You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: human ai collaboration challenges
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 laughs when he sees ChatGPT making a classical error.

2.
Label: anticipating potential benefits with more time
Quotes:
- E04: It seems like it's, you know, pretty straightforward to use and like intuitive, which is nice. And it's like, it's easy to interact with. So I feel like if I had like enough time to play around with it, it could be like really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Straightforward to use and intuitive.

3.
Label: balancing efficiency and the need for deeper understanding
Quotes:
- E04: It'd be that I just take this and see what this does. This should just be a single node so it'll kind of overwrite what I already did. (interviewer's observation) E04 uses the AI-generated code completely when realizing time constraints.

4.
Label: follows a structured setup process
Quotes:
- E04: I just like being able to kind of, like, iteratively build it. The thing that I always do when I create a model is I do, like, the initial command. I'll set up and go here. I'll go ahead and after I kind of set up the buttons, I'll put the functions behind them back here in the interface. (interviewer's observation) E04 creates the code skeleton before asking ChatGPT. He has a clear idea & established process of building ABMs.

5.
Label: seeks specific syntax help from ai
Quotes:
- E04: "how to define breeds in netlogo" (interviewer's observation) E04 tries to find certain syntax structures from the AI-generated code and ask for it when it is not there.

6.
Label: considers error messages before making decisions during the coding process
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 reads error messages before making a choice.

7.
Label: reacts with humor to ai's errors
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 laughs when he sees ChatGPT making a classical error.

8.
Label: demand for expertise & experience
Quotes:
- E01: Part of this, the user needs a little practice in debugging their own code. There should be some exercises before you ask GPT to do this.  (interviewer's observation) Users need practice in debugging their own code and need to have exercises before asking AI.

9.
Label: sees ai as helpful for model translation
Quotes:
- E04: I've found that AI is really helpful for like, translating other models from other languages into NetLogo, for example. (interviewer's observation) Helpful for translating from other languages into NetLogo

10.
Label: valuing real time ai assistance
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

11.
Label: appreciates chat gpt's code organization and documentation features
Quotes:
- E01: I don't want chat GPT to write 27 operations in one line and show how brilliant it is. I wanted to separate out the code and, and it did a good job of not only did it write the code, but it commented the code. And then in addition to commenting the code externally, it did documentation. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT tends to provide comments and documentation. Generated code is easy to read.

12.
Label: indicating the need for more robust troubleshooting and recovery mechanisms
Quotes:
- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.

13.
Label: human-ai: augmentation => ai should augment human's ability rather than replace
Quotes:
- E01: I think the key is to not replace human judgment and ability, but to find a fast way to increase human capability and judgment. (interviewer's observation) Augmentation of human capabilities & building on human judgement. Subjectivity of humanity?

14.
Label: wanting immediate "fix" option
Quotes:
- E04: So, I guess that's kind of annoying because I didn't really want it to explain here, but that was the only option that I had. (interviewer's observation) E04 wants the "fix" option right after the errors are identified.

15.
Label: asks questions and seeks human intervention
Quotes:
- E04: "how can I plot the output of this model?" (interviewer's observation) E04 was prompted to follow-up with ChatGPT.

16.
Label: emphasizing importance of user expertise
Quotes:
- E04: To me, it seems like you need to have a certain degree of expertise to understand where the errors are and how to fix them. Because otherwise it's like you're going down this path where you're blindly following the ChatGPT and you have no idea what's going on. For less experienced people, I wouldn't like that because it could put you in a worse situation. (interviewer's observation) Requires expertise to understand errors and debug them. Risks to blindly follow ChatGPT, esp. for less experienced people.

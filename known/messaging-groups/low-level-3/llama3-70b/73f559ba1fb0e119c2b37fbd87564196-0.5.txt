You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify low-level descriptive codes for each message.
Codes should attempt to interpret events, actors, and intents.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (5 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...

5. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

Thoughts: In this initial conversation, I'll focus on identifying the actors, their intents, and the events unfolding. I'll consider the context of an online community emerging around Physics Lab, exploring how designers and users interact. From a learning sciences perspective, I'll examine how users engage with the platform and each other. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll analyze the role of technology in facilitating these interactions. From a participatory design perspective, I'll investigate how designers respond to user needs and feedback.

Codes for each message:
1. No text, just an image (Designer-2 shares an image)
2. Request for technical assistance; Uncensored avatar; Avatar customization (Designer-1 asks about uploading a high-definition avatar)
3. Query about platform compatibility (User-4229 asks about a PC version)
4. Technical assistance; Avatar upload; User profiling (Designer-1 offers to upload an avatar and asks about User-4229's profession)
5. User role disclosure; Professional affiliation (User-4229 reveals being a teacher)

Summary: The conversation begins with an image shared by Designer-2, followed by Designer-1 asking about uploading a high-definition avatar. User-4229 asks about a PC version, and Designer-1 offers to upload the avatar while inquiring about User-4229's profession. User-4229 reveals being a teacher.

Notes: It appears that Designer-1 is responsive to user needs, offering technical assistance and engaging in conversation. The conversation is centered around technical aspects of the platform, with a hint of community building ( Designer-1's question about User-4229's profession). I'll continue to monitor how designers and users interact, and how this interaction shapes the emerging online community.

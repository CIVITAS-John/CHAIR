You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not write repetitive ones.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Can you make a dynamic demonstration of mechanical wave and mechanical vibration, such as the propagation of transverse waves and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, I really hope to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, polarizers, etc., to demonstrate optical experiments~
- Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

Also, for optical experiments, I really hope to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, polarizers, etc., to demonstrate optical experiments~
- That's great, I hope it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no software that is convenient for drawing circuit diagrams for the circuit part of the exam
- If there could be an export function, or save and import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set the parameters in the office and import them directly in class.

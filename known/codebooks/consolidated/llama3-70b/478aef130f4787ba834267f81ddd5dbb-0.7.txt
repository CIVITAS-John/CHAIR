You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: seek consensus on design elements
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

2.
Label: advocate for enhanced user experience
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

3.
Label: provide technical limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

4.
Label: user 4231 uses emoji to greet
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

5.
Label: described update size
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

6.
Label: highlight needs for dynamic demonstrations
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

7.
Label: reinforce feature explanation
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

8.
Label: greeting
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
- User: Hello everyone
- Designer: Hello :)

9.
Label: advocate for practical features
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

10.
Label: manage community anticipation
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

11.
Label: encourage sharing of resources
Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

12.
Label: inform users of limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

13.
Label: highlight outdated technology
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

14.
Label: requested feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

15.
Label: informed about download availability
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

16.
Label: briefly responded
Quotes:
- User: ok

17.
Label: support user engagement with experimental setups
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

18.
Label: detailed overview of update
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

19.
Label: mitigate anxiety
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

20.
Label: resolve user concern
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

21.
Label: illustrate feature functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

22.
Label: manage community expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

23.
Label: seek guidance for practical use
Quotes:
- User: How to download?

24.
Label: commit to user suggestions in future updates
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

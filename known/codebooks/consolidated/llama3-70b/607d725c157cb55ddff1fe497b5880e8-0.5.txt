You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: update schedule provision, release timeframe estimation
Relationship: Inclusion (update schedule provision includes release timeframe estimation)
Criteria: Designer provides a timeline or schedule for an update or release, and estimates the release timeframe for a new version or sets a timeline for new features.
Label: Provision of Release Timeline

2.
Concepts: feedback planning, fostering participatory feedback
Relationship: Inclusion (feedback planning includes fostering participatory feedback)
Criteria: Designer plans to gather feedback and fosters participatory feedback.
Label: Feedback Solicitation

3.
Concepts: showing interest in target audience., user-centered design approach
Relationship: Intersection (showing interest in target audience intersects with user-centered design approach)
Criteria: Designer shows interest in understanding the target audience and their context, and attempts to understand user's role and needs.
Label: User-Centric Approach

4.
Concepts: praising the platform for its practicality, highlighting software usability
Relationship: Parallel (praising the platform for its practicality is parallel to highlighting software usability)
Criteria: User expresses satisfaction or praise for the usability or practicality of the Physics Lab online community.
Label: Positive User Experience

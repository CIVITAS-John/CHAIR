You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Create multiple interpretations for both the interviewee's verbal response and the interviewer's observations. Take note of emotions explicitly or implicitly expressed by the interviewee. Code through the lens of human-computer interaction and learning sciences.

Always follow the output format:
===
Thought: {What is the most common theme among the input quotes? Do not over-interpret the data.}
Phrase: {A single verb phrase that faithfully describes the topic}

Quotes:
- E04: So one thing I'm realizing now, part of my setup needs to be reset all. (interviewer's observation) E04 sees from the generated code and realizes that he needs to reset.
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E04 reads through the code and tries to debug with himself when the generated code does not do what it does.
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) Again, he reads the code and selectively copies code to the model.
- E04: I really liked how, like the code that it generates, if you could just kind of place that into the model automatically.  (interviewer's observation) The capability to put into the model automatically.
- E04: It's basically following best practices. It is not trying to ruthlessly create a model. (interviewer's observation) Not "ruthlessly create a model".
Keywords: e04, code, model, interviewer, verbal

Thought: The most common theme among the input quotes is E04's interaction with generated code and his desire for automatic integration into the model.
Phrase: E04 evaluates and integrates generated code into the model
===

===
Thought: Another theme is E04's silent reflection and debugging while working with the generated code.
Phrase: E04 silently debugs and selectively integrates code
===

===
Thought: The input quotes also suggest E04's appreciation for the generated code's adherence to best practices.
Phrase: E04 values best practice-oriented generated code

Thought: The quotes imply E04's preference for a more seamless integration of generated code into the model.
Phrase: E04 desires automatic code integration into the model
===

===
Thought: The input quotes suggest E04's meticulous approach to code integration, as he reads and selectively copies code into the model.
Phrase: E04 meticulously integrates code into the model
===

===
Thought: The quotes suggest E04's focus on understanding and debugging the generated code.
Phrase: E04 focuses on understanding and debugging generated code

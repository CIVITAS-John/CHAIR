You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

2.
Concepts: experiences frustration with ai, expresses frustration with limited ai options
- Instances where users express frustration with the AI's performance or limitations.
- Users express frustration with AI limitations or errors.

3.
Concepts: ai-generated code, fixes ai code errors through debugging
- The participant engages with AI-generated code, either by fixing errors or integrating it into the model.

Phrase: Seeking AI assistance

2.
Concepts: experiences frustration with ai, expresses frustration with limited ai options
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as experiencing frustration often leads to expressing frustration.
Criteria: Users experience and express frustration with AI limitations or errors.
Phrase: Expressing AI frustration

3.
Concepts: ai-generated code, fixes ai code errors through debugging
Relationship: The concepts are sequentially related, as fixing errors often follows the generation of AI code.

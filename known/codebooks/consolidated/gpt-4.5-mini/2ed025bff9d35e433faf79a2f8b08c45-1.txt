You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: novice, notes novice challenges
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both focus on the experiences of novices, highlighting the challenges faced while interacting with AI tools due to lack of prior experience.
Criteria: Novices identify and express the limitations and difficulties encountered with AI tools during their learning process.
Phrase: Identifying novice challenges 

2.
Concepts: recognize ai's role in error detection, acknowledge ai's effectiveness in error resolution
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as they both revolve around the acknowledgement of AI's contributions in error management, emphasizing recognition of its detection capability and subsequent resolution effectiveness.
Criteria: Users recognize and acknowledge the role of AI in both detecting and resolving coding errors satisfactorily.
Phrase: Acknowledging AI's error-related contributions

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: identifying limitations of llm-driven interfaces, facing effort constraints and limitations
- Participants identify limitations of LLM-driven interfaces for learning.
- Participants face constraints or limitations in terms of time or effort when working with LLM-driven interfaces and encounter limitations or capacity issues with AI-driven interfaces.

2.
Concepts: envisioning ai's potential, envisioning ai support for learning
- Participants envision and imagine AI improving the learning process.
- Participants envision AI support for learning and AI in learning support.

3.
Concepts: user input, requesting ai assistance for tasks
- User provides input or feedback to AI or requests specific assistance.
- Participants request AI assistance and provide instructions for tasks.

4.
Concepts: critically evaluating ai output and responses
- Participants critically evaluate AI output and responses, recognizing potential errors or limitations.
- Participants make decisions based on AI-generated responses, evaluating their relevance and accuracy.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: identifying limitations of llm-driven interfaces, facing effort constraints and limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as participants' identification of limitations is influenced by the effort constraints they face when working with LLM-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants identify limitations of LLM-driven interfaces and face constraints or limitations in terms of time or effort when working with them.
Phrase: Encounter limitations and constraints.

2.
Concepts: envisioning ai's potential, envisioning ai support for learning
Relationship: The concepts are related as participants' envisioning of AI's potential is linked to their imagination of AI support for learning.
Criteria: Participants envision AI improving the learning process and imagine AI support for learning.
Phrase: Envision AI potential.

3.
Concepts: user input, requesting ai assistance for tasks
Relationship: The concepts are related as participants' provision of input or feedback is a means of requesting AI assistance for specific tasks.
Criteria: Participants provide input or feedback to AI and request specific assistance for tasks.
Phrase: Request AI assistance.

4.
Concepts: critically evaluating ai output and responses
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants critically evaluate AI output and responses, recognizing potential errors or limitations, and make decisions based on AI-generated responses.
Phrase: Evaluate AI output.

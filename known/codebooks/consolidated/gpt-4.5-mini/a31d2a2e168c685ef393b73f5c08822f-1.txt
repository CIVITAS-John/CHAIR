You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: values ai's helpfulness, commends error clarification
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both reflect a positive perception of the AI's role in facilitating a clearer understanding of coding problems and enhancing user experience.
Criteria: Users actively express satisfaction with the AI's assistance in error resolution and clarify coding issues through recognition of its effectiveness.
Phrase: Acknowledge AI's effectiveness in error resolution 

2. 
Concepts: unclear error message, critique misleading error messages
Relationship: The concepts are interrelated as both highlight the user experience concerning the shortcomings of error messages, leading to frustration and misunderstandings during coding tasks.
Criteria: Users identify and critique specific instances of misleading and vague error messages that hinder their coding progress.
Phrase: Critique vagueness of error messages

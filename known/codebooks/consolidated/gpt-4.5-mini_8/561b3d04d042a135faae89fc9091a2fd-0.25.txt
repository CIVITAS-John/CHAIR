You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: emphasize collaboration over replacement, prioritize human judgment in ai interactions
- Interviewees emphasize the role of AI in enhancing human capabilities and judgment rather than replacing them.
- Interviewees emphasize the need for personal judgment and the importance of maintaining human oversight when evaluating and using AI-generated advice.

2.
Concepts: engage ai to resolve coding issues, seek collaborative problem-solving
- Users fix AI-generated errors and query the AI for missing code structures to enhance their coding efforts.
- Users seek collaborative problem-solving by asking AI to assist with coding challenges and implement their ideas.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. 
Concepts: emphasize collaboration over replacement, prioritize human judgment in ai interactions
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as both highlight the importance of human involvement and oversight in the use of AI, suggesting a partnership rather than a substitution.
Criteria: Interviewees emphasize the role of AI in enhancing human capabilities and judgment while prioritizing personal judgment and maintaining human oversight in AI interactions.
Phrase: Advocate for human-AI collaboration

2. 
Concepts: engage ai to resolve coding issues, seek collaborative problem-solving
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as both involve users actively interacting with AI to address coding challenges, indicating a reliance on AI as a collaborative tool rather than a standalone solution.
Criteria: Users engage AI to resolve coding issues and seek collaborative problem-solving by querying the AI for assistance with coding challenges.
Phrase: Utilize AI for coding collaboration

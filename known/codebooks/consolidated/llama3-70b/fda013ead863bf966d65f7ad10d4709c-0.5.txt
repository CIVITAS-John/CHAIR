You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

- Instances where the Designer announces updates or changes to the simulation components.

2. upcoming changes, software updates.
- Mentions of planned or upcoming changes to the software.
- Mentions of changes or updates to the software's features or functionality

3. iterative design, iterative development.
- The process of continuously improving the software based on user feedback and evolving needs.
- The Developer continuously updating and improving the software based on user feedback and community input.

4. user feedback, participatory feedback.
- Instances where users provide feedback, suggestions, or reactions to the software.
- Direct responses or suggestions from users that might be used by designers to improve the software.

5. user input, request for suggestions.
- The designer seeking input from users for future software updates and features
- Designers asking for input or suggestions to enhance the software.

6. response to user feedback, designer responsiveness.
- Designer's reactions and adjustments based on user feedback
- Responses from the software designer to user feedback, indicating consideration or implementation of suggested features.

7. community contribution, community involvement in development.
- How the community contributes to the software's development and decision-making
- The community members and designers work together to shape the development of the software

8. feedback and iteration, user feedback and engagement.
- The ways in which the community's feedback influences the software's design and development
- The community members' active engagement and feedback, which informs the design and development process

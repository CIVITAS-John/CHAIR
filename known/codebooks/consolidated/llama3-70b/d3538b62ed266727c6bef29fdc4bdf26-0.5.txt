You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
3. {Repeat the input 3}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 3}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 3}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 3}

Definitions for each code:

1. software updates, new version announcements
Relationship: Inclusion (the second concept is a specific type of the first)
Criteria: The quote announces or discusses changes to the app's features or software.
Label: Software Development Updates

2. follow-up question, ask followup question on user request
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts describe seeking additional information)
Criteria: The quote seeks clarification or additional information about a request or topic.
Label: Information Seeking

3. context, explain situation
Relationship: Inclusion (the second concept is a specific type of the first)
Criteria: The quote references or describes a situation, environment, or context that influences the use of Physics Lab.
Label: Contextual Factors

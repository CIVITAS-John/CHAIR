Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the community's emergence.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...

1. Designer: Play by conducting experiments.233
2. P8: Why suddenly add a wave?
3. P7: Oh, I see.
4. P2: [Image]
5. P2: [Image]
6. P7: 66
7. P7: How to connect
8. P7: Let him
9. P2: The terminals are all on top
10. P2: It's quite simple
11. P7: How to make it work
12. P7: How to display the data
13. P7: That key
14. P2: [Image]
15. P2: Just press the button with the wire

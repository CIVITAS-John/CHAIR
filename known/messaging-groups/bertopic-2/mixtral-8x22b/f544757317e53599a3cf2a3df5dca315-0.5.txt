You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Create multiple interpretations for both the interviewee's verbal response and the interviewer's observations. Take note of emotions explicitly or implicitly expressed by the interviewee. Code through the lens of human-computer interaction and learning sciences.

Always follow the output format:

Thought: {What is the most common theme among the input quotes? Do not over-interpret the data.}
Phrase: {A single verb phrase that faithfully describes the topic}

Quotes:
- E04: I guess, in their databases, they still have like, NetLogo 5 in there and stuff. So like, for example, you know, the anonymous functions, they still use like, the old, sometimes I'll get like, the old functionality for the anonymous functions. (interviewer's observation) Writing code in older versions of NetLogo
- E04: Because I'll like forget the syntax sometimes and I usually use the netlogo dictionary and just have it like open to the side. (interviewer's observation) E04 still forgets about the syntax and ChatGPT can help.
- E04: So if I can talk to it in NetLogo, does that mean I could give it in the logo command and then it would like turn that into code on the backend or? (interviewer's observation) Initial confusion over what the system could do.

Thought: The most common theme among the input quotes is the interviewee's (E04) experience with using NetLogo and their initial confusion about the capabilities of a potential LLM-driven interface.
Phrase: E04's experience with NetLogo and confusion about LLM-driven interface capabilities
===

===
Thought: Another theme is E04's reliance on external resources, such as the NetLogo dictionary and potential LLM-driven interfaces, to assist with coding syntax.
Phrase: E04's reliance on external resources for coding syntax assistance
===

===
Thought: The input quotes also suggest that E04 may be using older versions of NetLogo, leading to occasional confusion with syntax and functionality.
Phrase: E04's use of older NetLogo versions causing syntax and functionality confusion
===

===
Thought: E04 expresses curiosity about the potential of an LLM-driven interface to convert Logo commands into code, indicating a desire for improved coding support.
Phrase: E04's curiosity about LLM-driven interface's potential to convert Logo commands into code
===

===
Thought: The interviewer's observations highlight E04's initial confusion about the capabilities of an LLM-driven interface, suggesting a need for clearer explanations or demonstrations.
Phrase: Need for clearer explanations or demonstrations of LLM-driven interface capabilities

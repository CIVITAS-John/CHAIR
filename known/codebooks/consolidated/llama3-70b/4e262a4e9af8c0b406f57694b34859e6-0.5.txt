You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

12.
Label: express satisfaction
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]
- User: Oh, this is nice

13.
Label: discuss user control
Quotes:
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

14.
Label: announce upcoming updates
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

15.
Label: apologize for timing
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

16.

Label: state version purpose
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

21.
Label: product gap
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

22.
Label: consider comprehensive solution
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

23.
Label: response to question

- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?
- User: Left side

24.
Label: describe planned feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

25.
Label: acknowledge perfectionism
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

26.
Label: self-solved
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

- User: How do you use the PC version?

29.
Label: inform about extensive update
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

30.
Label: acknowledging community needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

31.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the community's emergence.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

- P7: "How to play?"
- P8: "Why suddenly add a wave?"

## Responses
Definition: Messages that directly answer or address a previous participant's question or request.
- P6: [Image] (In response to P5's request for logic gates)
- Designer: "Play by conducting experiments.233" (In response to P7 asking how to play)
- P7: "Oh, I see." (Acknowledging the response or information provided)

# Engagement
## Inquiry
Definition: Instances where participants ask questions that stimulate further discussion or clarification.

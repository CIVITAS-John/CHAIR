You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (18 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
18. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: Thank you.
Preliminary phrases: expressing gratitude; acknowledging support; showing appreciation
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary phrases: encouraging open communication; promoting transparency; fostering a sense of community
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary phrases: providing feedback; sharing user experience; evaluating software; highlighting usability
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary phrases: considering user needs; exploring solutions; discussing technical possibilities
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary phrases: explaining technical possibilities; providing theoretical context; clarifying compatibility
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary phrases: announcing updates; sharing news; providing resources; facilitating access
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

Thoughts: 
In this first round of coding, I aim to capture the essence of the conversation between the users and designers of Physics Lab. I will focus on the language used, the tone, and the content to identify emerging themes related to the research question. I will analyze the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will explore how the designers and users interact, what kind of feedback is provided, and how the designers respond to user needs. Guiding questions include: What kind of community is emerging? How do designers and users collaborate? What are the key concerns and needs of the users?

Interpretation phrases for each item:
1. expressing gratitude; acknowledging support; showing appreciation
2. encouraging open communication; promoting transparency; fostering a sense of community
3. providing feedback; sharing user experience; evaluating software; highlighting usability
4. considering user needs; exploring solutions; discussing technical possibilities
5. explaining technical possibilities; providing theoretical context; clarifying compatibility
6. announcing updates; sharing news; providing resources; facilitating access
7. listing new features; describing updates; highlighting improvements; showcasing functionality
8. suggesting new feature; highlighting regional needs; emphasizing accessibility
9. acknowledging suggestion; promising implementation; committing to updates
10. proposing additional feature; considering user interface; emphasizing usability
11. explaining existing functionality; describing technical limitations; highlighting constraints
12. acknowledging limitation; explaining workaround; providing technical insight
13. sharing personal experience; illustrating technical issue; highlighting workaround
14. expressing agreement; showing understanding; acknowledging insight
15. suggesting new feature; highlighting convenience; emphasizing practicality
16. promising implementation; committing to updates; acknowledging user needs
17. inquiring about infrastructure; exploring technical requirements; assessing feasibility
18. explaining technical constraint; describing institutional policy; highlighting limitations

Summary: 
The conversation revolves around the users' experiences with Physics Lab, their feedback, and suggestions for improvement. The designers respond by acknowledging and addressing these concerns, providing technical explanations, and promising updates. The tone is collaborative, with both parties working together to improve the software. The conversation highlights the importance of usability, accessibility, and regional considerations in the design of Physics Lab.

Notes: 
A sense of community is emerging, with users and designers interacting openly and transparently. The designers are responsive to user needs and concerns, and the users are actively providing feedback and suggestions. The conversation highlights the importance of considering regional and institutional constraints in the design of Physics Lab. A key theme is the focus on usability and accessibility, with users and designers working together to improve the software.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: lack persistence in problem-solving, critique ai options and express frustration
- Users illustrate a lack of persistence in pursuing solutions after encountering repeated issues with AI.
- Users express frustration at the limited options provided by AI and persistent unresolved errors.

2.
Concepts: recognize ai's limitations, recognize ai constraints
- Users acknowledge AI's limitations while valuing its error detection capabilities.
- Users express constraints that restrict their ability to effectively utilize AI-generated solutions and identify limitations in AI's access to external validation sources.

3.
Concepts: praises ai's troubleshooting support, value clarity in troubleshooting and error explanations
- Interviewees express appreciation for AI’s troubleshooting capabilities in user support.
- Users value the AI's ability to provide clear explanations and effective troubleshooting for errors.

4.
Concepts: specify detailed model requirements, initiate tasks and dictate parameters to ai
- Users provide detailed instructions to AI to effectively convey their programming requirements.
- Users initiate programming tasks by articulating requests and dictating parameters to AI.

Definitions for each code (4 in total):

1.
Concepts: lack persistence in problem-solving, critique ai options and express frustration  
Relationship: Users' frustration with AI options relates directly to their lack of persistence in finding solutions, as repeated issues lead to disengagement.  
Criteria: Users encounter repeated issues with AI and, instead of continuing to seek solutions, they critique the limited options provided, expressing frustration.  
Phrase: Express frustration over AI's limitations.

2.
Concepts: recognize ai's limitations, recognize ai constraints  
Relationship: Users' acknowledgment of AI's limitations goes hand-in-hand with their awareness of the constraints that hinder effective utilization, which informs their overall understanding of its capabilities.  
Criteria: Users acknowledge AI's limitations and identify constraints that restrict their effective use of AI-generated solutions.  
Phrase: Acknowledge AI's limitations and constraints.

3.
Concepts: praises ai's troubleshooting support, value clarity in troubleshooting and error explanations  
Relationship: Users’ appreciation for AI’s troubleshooting support is directly connected to their desire for clarity in explanations, as both contribute to a more effective user experience.  
Criteria: Users express appreciation for the AI's troubleshooting support while valuing clear explanations and effective error troubleshooting.  
Phrase: Appreciate AI’s troubleshooting clarity.

4.
Concepts: specify detailed model requirements, initiate tasks and dictate parameters to ai  
Relationship: Users specifying detailed requirements is inherently linked to initiating tasks, as clear communication of needs is necessary for effective programming interactions with AI.  
Criteria: Users initiate programming tasks by providing detailed instructions and dictating parameters to AI to convey their requirements effectively.  
Phrase: Initiate tasks with detailed specifications.

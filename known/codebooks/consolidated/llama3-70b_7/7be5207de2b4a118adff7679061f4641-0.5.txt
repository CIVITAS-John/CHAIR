You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: propose another feature
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

2.
Label: asking follow-up questions on needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

3.
Label: vague on responses to the feature request
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

4.
Label: communication about progress and plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

19.
Label: community feedback
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

24.
Label: appreciation of features
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

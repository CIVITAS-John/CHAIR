You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:
1.
Concepts: integrate ai into workflow, integrates ai-generated code fully
Relationship: The concept "integrate ai into workflow" is a broader idea that encompasses the idea of "integrates ai-generated code fully", which is a specific way of integrating AI into the workflow.
Criteria: Participants seamlessly incorporate AI-generated code into their existing models or systems to enhance their workflow.
Phrase: Integrates AI into workflow seamlessly.

2.
Concepts: encounter unclear error messages, experiences debugging frustration due to unclear error messages
Relationship: The concept "encounter unclear error messages" is a cause, and "experiences debugging frustration" is an effect, where unclear error messages lead to debugging frustration.
Criteria: Participants struggle with debugging due to unclear or unhelpful error messages that hinder their understanding of the issues.
Phrase: Encounter frustrating error messages.

3.
Concepts: highlights learning needs, emphasize debugging skills
Relationship: The concept "highlights learning needs" is a more general idea, and "emphasize debugging skills" is a specific example of learning needs that are highlighted.
Criteria: Participants stress the importance of debugging skills and practice for users to overcome challenges in LLM-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Emphasize essential debugging skills.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

7.
Label: inform about power supply options
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

8.
Label: detail educational benefits
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

9.
Label: give an example of the feature's functions
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

Label: affirm shared understanding among community members
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.
- User: Indeed

14.

Quotes:
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]

18.
Label: encourage interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

Label: responded to suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

20.
Label: request specific features
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

21.
Label: inquire about userâ€™s teaching background
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

22.
Label: designer 1 emphasizes usability
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

23.
Label: provided teaching background
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify low-level descriptive codes for each message.
Codes should attempt to interpret events, actors, and intents.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (13 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...

13. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary codes: request for technical assistance; uncensored avatar; avatar customization
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary codes: query about platform compatibility
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary codes: technical assistance; avatar upload; user profiling
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary codes: user role disclosure; professional affiliation
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: I will analyze the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will look for codes that reveal the emergence of the online community, the roles of designers and users, and the negotiation of technical and content-related issues. I will also explore how the designers and users co-construct the Physics Lab online community.

Codes for each message:

1. image sharing
2. request for technical assistance; uncensored avatar; avatar customization
3. query about platform compatibility
4. technical assistance; avatar upload; user profiling
5. user role disclosure; professional affiliation
6. community announcement; development plan sharing
7. invitation for feedback; participatory design
8. user suggestion; content request; physics topic
9. development prioritization; content sequencing
10. feedback gathering; community engagement
11. appreciation; community building
12. query about resource access; platform compatibility
13. resource access; community support

Summary: The conversation starts with the designers sharing images and providing technical assistance. The users begin to participate by asking questions about platform compatibility and requesting features. The designers respond by sharing the development plan and inviting feedback. The users start to make suggestions about the content, and the designers prioritize the development process. The conversation is characterized by a sense of community building and participatory design.

Notes: It seems that the designers are actively engaging with the users, providing technical assistance and inviting feedback. The users are taking on active roles, making suggestions and requesting features. The conversation is moving towards a collaborative and participatory approach to designing the Physics Lab online community.

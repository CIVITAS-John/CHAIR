You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: The conversation so far seems to be focused on the meaning of the "+1" expression, which appears to be a way for members of the Physics Lab online community to indicate their agreement or support for a previous message. The messages suggest that this is a common practice within the community, and that new members may not be familiar with it. To further understand the emergence of this community, it would be useful to explore how this expression developed, how it is used in different contexts, and whether there are other community-specific practices or norms that are being established.

Tags for each message:
1. community participation; self-deprecation
2. community participation; agreement
3. community participation
4. community participation
5. community participation; user inquiry
6. community participation; user explanation
7. community participation; user explanation
8. community participation
9. community participation; user guidance

Summary: The conversation starts with a member, P14, making a self-deprecating remark about their participation in the community. This is followed by several other members, P13, P15, and P16, expressing their agreement or support by using the "+1" expression, which seems to be a common way for the community to indicate shared opinions or experiences. When a new member, P10, asks about the meaning of "+1", other members, P11 and P13, provide explanations, suggesting that this is a well-established practice within the community. The conversation also includes a brief, ambiguous message from P13, and a suggestion to search on Baidu for more information.

Notes: The use of the "+1" expression suggests that the Physics Lab online community has developed its own set of norms and practices for communication and community engagement. The fact that new members are unfamiliar with this expression indicates that there may be a process of onboarding and socialization that newcomers need to go through to fully participate in the community. Additionally, the self-deprecating remark from P14 suggests that there may be a sense of community identity or shared experience that is being expressed. Further analysis of the community's communication patterns, the context in which the "+1" expression is used, and the overall tone and dynamics of the community would be helpful in understanding how it has emerged and evolved over time.

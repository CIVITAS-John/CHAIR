You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* User support and software access
* User interaction
=> User engagement

* Collaborative community engagement
* Cross-disciplinary engagement
=> Community building

* Compatibility optimization
* Designer updates
=> Platform improvement

* Communication
* Teaching backgrounds
=> Support resources

# Reflection
- More categories for merging could be identified, such as cross-disciplinary engagement and collaborative community engagement under a broader category like community building.
- No over-merged categories were identified in the draft plan.
- The naming of the categories seems accurate and aligned with the research context.

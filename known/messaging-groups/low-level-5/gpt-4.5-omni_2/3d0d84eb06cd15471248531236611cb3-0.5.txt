You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: explained future feature; highlighted educational utility; responded to user feedback
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: expressed approval; provided feedback; engaged in community interaction
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: announced future consultation; demonstrated participatory design; engaged in community interaction
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: solicited teacher feedback; demonstrated participatory design; engaged in community consultation
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: shared visual reference; solicited confirmation; engaged in community consultation
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirmed visual reference; provided feedback; engaged in community interaction
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation reveals a dynamic interaction between the designers and the community, particularly focusing on the development of a new feature for simulated experiment assessment in the context of electricity. The designers actively solicited feedback from teachers and users, demonstrating a participatory design approach. They shared visual references, requested clarifications, and iterated on the design based on community input. Users expressed approval, provided feedback, and engaged in discussions about design elements. The designers acknowledged feedback, suggested simplifications, and proposed compromises. They also provided updates on the development progress and the release schedule, managing user expectations and expressing gratitude for community support.

Notes: The participatory design approach is evident in the designers' consistent engagement with the community. The iterative process and frequent updates suggest a user-centered development strategy. The conversation highlights the importance of visual references and clarification in collaborative design. Future analysis could explore how the community's feedback influences the final design and how the iterative release schedule impacts user engagement and satisfaction.

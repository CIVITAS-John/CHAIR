You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

9.
Label: considering the possibility of making the platform compatible with older systems
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

10.
Label: engage users with update

12.
Label: provide specific feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- User: Left side

Label: designer 1 greets back with a smiley face
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

15.
Label: balancing complexity with usability
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Make it simpler...

16.
Label: progress update
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.
- Designer: The update is quite large...
- Designer: We are working on this part

17.
Label: expressing interest in broader content
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

18.
Label: sharing environmental constraints
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

19.
Label: indirect reject
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

20.
Label: inquiring about expansion to other physics domains
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

21.
Label: asking if the user is a teacher
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
- User: Yes.

22.
Label: ensuring clear communication
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

23.
Label: ask followup question on usage scenario
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

24.
Label: single slits
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* feedback and support
* community building and interaction
* sharing and collaboration
* user-centered design
* social interaction
* emotional and social aspects
* development and maintenance
* personal background
* physics education focus
* design elements
* physics experimentation
* collaborative design approach
* content development
* learning environment

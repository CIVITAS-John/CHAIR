You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is merged from multiple ones. Consolidate into a single label and criteria that covers all concepts. Labels and criteria should be clear and generalizable, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

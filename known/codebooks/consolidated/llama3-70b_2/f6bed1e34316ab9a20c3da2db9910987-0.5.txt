You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: designer 1 acknowledges user's context
Quotes:
- Designer: ðŸ˜‚

2.
Label: considering diverse user environments

- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

3.
Label: designer 1 theorizes compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

7.
Label: suggest circuit diagram drawing tool
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

8.

- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

22.
Label: expressing confusion
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?
- User: How to download?

24.
Label: designer 1 informs about dc and ac support
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

25.
Label: updating users about changes in simulation
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

- Participants experience frustration points when working with AI-driven interfaces.
- Participants express frustration when encountering unhelpful error messages

2.
Concepts: benefit of ai - translation, benefit from ai's natural language capabilities

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: encounter errors with ai, express frustration with unhelpful error messages
Relationship: The concepts are causally related, as encountering errors with AI leads to expressing frustration with unhelpful error messages.
Criteria: Participants experience frustration when encountering errors with AI-driven interfaces due to unhelpful error messages.
Phrase: Encounter and express frustration with AI errors

2.
Concepts: benefit of ai - translation, benefit from ai's natural language capabilities
Relationship: The concepts are complementary, as the benefit of AI-driven interfaces in translation is facilitated by AI's natural language capabilities.
Criteria: Participants benefit from LLM-driven interfaces that leverage natural language capabilities for model translation.
Phrase: Leverage AI's language capabilities for translation

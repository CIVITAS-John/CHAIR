Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label: A label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
4. Designer-1: There will be.
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
Can you identify more categories for merging?
Yes, the categories "design considerations" and "feature requests and feedback" can be merged into the "community engagement" category, as they both relate to user feedback and community involvement in the design process.

Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
The "participatory design" category may be too broad, as it encompasses both user experience design and the overall participatory community design process. These could potentially be split into two separate categories.

Is any naming inaccurate?
The naming of the categories seems accurate and concise, covering the key aspects of the research question.

* user experience design
=> participatory design

* communication and transparency
* design considerations
* feature requests and feedback
=> community engagement

* collaborative learning
* software features and updates

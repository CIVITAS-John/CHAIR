You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

Here is the codebook for analyzing the interaction:

* Summary
The conversation revolves around the development and updates of Physics Lab's online community, with designers and users discussing technical aspects, providing feedback, and sharing experiences.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do designers and users interact and influence each other? What are the key factors in the emergence of Physics Lab's online community? How do technical aspects and user experiences shape the development of the platform?

# Technical Development
## Envisioning Ideal Components
Definition: Designers envision and discuss ideal components for the platform.
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate)."
- "The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component."
- (Implicitly) "XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine."

## Addressing Technical Issues
Definition: Designers and users discuss and troubleshoot technical problems.
- "It does not support the XP system."
- "Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old."
- "Win7 should be fine."

# User Engagement
## Seeking Feedback
Definition: Designers solicit feedback and suggestions from users.
- "Okay. Please give more suggestions!"
- (Implicitly) "No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group."

## Sharing User Experiences
Definition: Users share their experiences and opinions about the platform.
- "This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use."
- (Implicitly) "How do you use the PC version?"

# Community Building
## Fostering Open Communication
Definition: Designers and users engage in open and polite communication.
- "No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group."
- "Thank you."
- "Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:"

Note: This codebook is a starting point, and codes can be refined, merged, or split as the analysis progresses.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---

1. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; community gratitude; social norms
2. P4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary tags: pc version inquiry; interactive whiteboard; user request; platform accessibility
3. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary tags: group files; resource access; user satisfaction; community resources
4. Designer: [Image 2-14]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary tags: update announcement; component simulation; design iteration
6. Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary tags: component update; ideal components; simulation features
7. Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. P4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. P4232: [Image 2-19]
10. P8: It does not support the XP system.

3. group files; resource access; user satisfaction; community resources; shared knowledge
4. image sharing; visual communication; community engagement
5. update announcement; component simulation; design iteration; feedback incorporation; community involvement
6. component update; ideal components; simulation features; educational tools; learning resources
7. feedback solicitation; community engagement; participatory design; collaborative development
8. pc version inquiry; user experience; software usage; troubleshooting
9. image sharing; visual communication; community engagement; user-generated content
10. platform limitation; system compatibility; technical issue; user feedback

Summary: The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community, where users request resources, provide feedback, and engage with the designer. The designer responds by sharing updates, providing resources, and soliciting feedback. The community exhibits social norms of appreciation, gratitude, and shared knowledge.

Notes: The conversation suggests that the community values open communication, resource sharing, and collaborative development. The designer's responsiveness and willingness to incorporate feedback may contribute to the community's growth and engagement. The use of images and emojis adds a social dimension to the conversation, fostering a sense of community and inclusivity.

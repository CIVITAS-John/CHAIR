1.
Label: highlighting teacher specific needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

10.
Label: explaining the focus on electricity and mechanics
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

20.
Label: suggesting categorization
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

21.
Label: community feedback
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

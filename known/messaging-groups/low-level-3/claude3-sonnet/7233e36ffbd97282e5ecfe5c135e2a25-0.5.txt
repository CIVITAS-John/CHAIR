You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary tags: teaching experience
2. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
Preliminary tags: version update; app store process
3. Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
Preliminary tags: apology; late communication
4. P4233: How to download?
Preliminary tags: download inquiry
5. P4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary tags: conversation starter
6. P8: Group sharing.
Preliminary tags: group functionality
7. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

Thoughts: To analyze how this online community emerged, we need to look at the interactions from multiple angles - the learning sciences lens to understand how knowledge is shared and constructed, the HCI lens to see how the technology mediates the interactions, and the participatory design lens to examine how users are involved in shaping the product. Some guiding questions are: How are teaching experiences and domain knowledge shared? How does the app and its updates facilitate or constrain the interactions? How are user needs and feedback incorporated into the design process?

Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. teaching background; experience sharing
2. software update; development process  
3. social norm; communication style
4. technology access; user inquiry
5. conversation initiation; social presence
6. collaborative features; group affordances
7. technology access; software distribution
8. product roadmap; user feedback solicitation; feature planning; cloud integration  
9. social expression; emoji use
10. social expression; emoji use

Summary: The conversation starts with a teacher (P4232) sharing their teaching experience. The designer then announces an app update and apologizes for late communication. Another user (P4233) asks how to download the app. The designer provides download instructions and invites user feedback on new features like cloud integration. Some users respond with emojis, potentially indicating social presence and engagement. Overall, the community seems to involve knowledge sharing among educators, product updates from the designer, and user feedback incorporated into the design process.

Notes: The learning sciences perspective shows how teachers share their domain knowledge and experiences in this community. The HCI lens reveals how the app and its updates mediate the interactions, with some constraints (e.g. app store review process) and affordances (e.g. group file sharing, cloud integration). From the participatory design view, the designer actively seeks user feedback to shape future features. The use of emojis may indicate social expression and community-building. Hypotheses include: this community facilitates peer learning among educators; the designer aims to develop the app iteratively based on user needs; cloud integration could enable more collaborative learning experiences.

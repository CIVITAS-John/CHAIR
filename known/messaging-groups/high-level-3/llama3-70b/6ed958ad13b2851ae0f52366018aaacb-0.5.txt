Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases for codes. For each code, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

Here is the codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a user expressing gratitude to the designers. Then, a user asks about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab and finds the group files. The designers share updates and features of the software, and users ask questions about using the PC version.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. We will explore how the online community emerges through user-designer interactions, feedback, and support. Guiding questions include: How do users navigate the online space to find resources? How do designers respond to user inquiries and suggestions? What features and updates are prioritized, and how do they impact user experience?

# Community Building
## Expressing Gratitude

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1

1. P14: How do you say?
2. P14: [Image 299]
3. P17: Brainiac.
4. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
5. P18: Just downloaded it.
6. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10
7. P6: When will it be updated?
8. P20: Why does that fuse keep burning out?

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab's online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation appears to be about a tool or software, with participants asking questions, sharing resources, and discussing issues they're experiencing.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do participants use language and resources to facilitate learning and problem-solving? How do they negotiate meaning and coordinate action in an online environment? What role do tools and software play in the community's emergence and development?

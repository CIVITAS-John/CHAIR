You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

2.
Concepts: usability improvement, product development cycle
- Designers improve the usability or user experience of Physics Lab.
- Designers release new versions or updates of Physics Lab, and add new components, features, or functionalities.

3.
Concepts: diagram creation, circuit design
- Designers discuss or mention drawing or creating circuit diagrams, mentioning circuit diagrams or relating them to other representations.
- The designer or user discusses designing or creating circuits, including consulting teachers or researching conversion between physical and circuit diagrams.

4.
Concepts: development timelines, software update schedule
- Discussion of development timelines or schedules.
- Discussion of software update schedules or timelines, and discussion of the timing of a platform-specific update.

5.
Concepts: resource sharing and collaboration, group resources and file sharing
- Users share or request resources, files, or materials within the community.
- Designer shares files or resources with the group, availability or access to group resources, files, or materials.

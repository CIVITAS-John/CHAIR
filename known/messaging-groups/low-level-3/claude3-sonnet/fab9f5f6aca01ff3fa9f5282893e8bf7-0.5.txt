You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

Thoughts: This conversation seems to revolve around community norms and shared experiences within the Physics Lab online community. Participants are using the "+1" expression to indicate agreement or shared experiences, which is then explained to someone unfamiliar with this norm. There also seems to be some self-deprecating humor and acknowledgment of non-elite status. To better understand the emergence of this community, I should look for tags related to community building, shared identity, and socialization of new members.

Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. self-deprecation; outsider status; humor
2. agreement; shared experience; community norm
3. agreement; shared experience; community norm  
4. agreement; shared experience; community norm
5. seeking clarification; inquiring about norms; newcomer
6. explaining norms; facilitating understanding; community socialization
7. explaining norms; community norm
8. pause filler; hesitation  
9. suggesting external resource; deflecting explanation

Summary: The conversation starts with some self-deprecating humor and acknowledgment of non-elite status within the Physics Lab community. Several participants then use the "+1" expression to indicate agreement and shared experiences. When someone asks for clarification on the meaning of "+1", other members explain that it is a community norm indicating agreement or shared opinion. One member hesitates and then suggests looking up the meaning externally rather than providing a direct explanation.

Notes: The use of the "+1" expression and the willingness of community members to explain its meaning to newcomers suggests the emergence of shared norms and socialization processes within the Physics Lab online community. The self-deprecating humor and acknowledgment of non-elite status could indicate the formation of an in-group identity distinct from perceived elites or outsiders. The hesitation and deflection in fully explaining the norm could suggest some gatekeeping or reluctance to fully integrate newcomers.

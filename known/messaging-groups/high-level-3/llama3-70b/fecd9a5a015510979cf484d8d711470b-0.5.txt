Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases for codes. For each code, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Here is the codebook to analyze the interaction:

* Summary
The conversation starts with User-4230 making a request for new features in Physics Lab, specifically dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves and optical experiments. Designer-1 responds by prioritizing other sections, promising to gather opinions before starting on mechanics. User-4230 expresses gratitude, and then User-4231 asks about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab. Designer-1 responds with an image and announces an upcoming update to the student power supply component.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we will explore how the online community emerges through user requests, designer responses, and the negotiation of priorities. We will examine how users and designers interact, what features are requested and prioritized, and how the designers communicate updates and changes. Guiding questions include: How do users influence the development of Physics Lab? How do designers balance user requests with their own priorities? How do designers communicate with users, and what role does feedback play in the development process?

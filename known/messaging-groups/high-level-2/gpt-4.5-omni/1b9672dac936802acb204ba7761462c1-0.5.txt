Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. P13: First year of high school
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image 198]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 202]
9. P14: How do you say it?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, they heat up quickly and save materials. But this is also fine, if you're a bit extravagant, you can cover a fish tank and connect a tube ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Won't the condensed liquid flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid has already been heated during reflux, making it less likely to break
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry things, probably won't be able to touch it before the second half of the year..
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be exactly the same as in the books, although during exams...
20. P1: There isn't any relatively realistic chemistry software at the moment
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was okay
22. Designer: But even the gods of organic chemistry can't solve it
23. Designer: So if you want to do it, you still have to consider it from the exam perspective
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section on electricity will have it, such as charged operations)
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a larger amount of computation...
32. P1: If you have the ability to make a comprehensive and free one, it should be very popular
33. P2: If the CPU is bad, it's game over
34. P11: Adding what you said, it wouldn't be "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
35. P1: It's a series of lab courses
36. P11: Hey, good idea
37. P2: Hehe
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is very annoying?
39. P2: @Designer Can you add a light sensor?
40. Designer: The problem is
41. Designer: Where does the light come from
42. P11: What about the light
43. Designer: Are you using a small bulb to illuminate the photoresistor?
44. P2: Tap with your hand
45. P14: I think there's no problem
46. Designer: Isn't that just a variable resistor, except the curve is different (â€¦â€¦)
47. P2: And a small light
48. Designer: Micro-payment maybe...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 245]
52. Designer: We'll see
53. Designer: If you don't have money, you can also click on ads
54. Designer: It's the approach of a conscientious game
55. P1: Put up ads
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: If you tap and release, it won't conduct electricity
58. Designer: Oh
59. Designer: Forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (â€¦â€¦)
60. P11: ðŸ˜‚
61. P11: Just about to say
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but that you don't know how to pay
63. P11: It can also be adapted to 3D touch
64. Designer: Just charge directly through the app store?
65. P14: Feels a bit troublesome
66. P2: â€¦â€¦
67. Designer: Now you can do it with just a fingerprint on the app store
68. P14: After all, just a middle school kid
69. Designer: That's true
70. Designer: Then just click on ads hh
71. P14: That's doable
72. P2: What's wrong with middle school [Emoji 268]
73. P2: Even a middle schooler is better than you
74. P11: Just hope the ads don't take up too much of the experiment interface
75. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
76. P11: He means he doesn't have a good payment method in middle school
77. P2: Oh.
78. P2: ï½ž
79. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
80. Designer: Just let you click on ads to earn points, and use points to unlock new content
81. P14: @P2 Maybe you can follow the network cable to hit me
82. P2: I can program
83. P11: Okay!
84. P2: [Emoji 280]
85. Designer: Permanent ad banners on iOS are really disgusting
86. P2: Indeed
87. Designer: The screen is not big and has psoriasis.
88. P2: And it forces you to click.
89. P2: What are the ads used for @Designer 
90. Designer: Health preservation...
91. Designer: Doing this requires nurturing people...
92. P1: It's not free.
93. Designer: Actually, it's the same as charging money, except you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay.
94. P2: Oh.
95. Designer: Do a bit more.
96. Designer: There are some other ways.
97. P8: The points wall is okay.
98. P8: @Designer I think it's okay.
99. P14: I also think it's fine.
100. Designer: Actually, you can learn from that mini program.
101. Designer: Creating, reviewing, and doing questions.
102. P14: æ€Žä¹ˆè¯´ï¼Ÿ
103. P14: [Image 299]
104. P17: Brain King.
105. P18: By the way, how to use it?
106. P18: Just downloaded.
107. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10

* Summary
The conversation involves multiple participants (P1, P2, P11, P14, P17, P18, P19, Designer) discussing various topics related to physics and chemistry experiments, software for simulation, and potential features and monetization strategies for an educational app. The dialogue includes questions about MOSFETs, superconductors, and light sensors, and touches on the practicality of certain experimental setups. There is also a debate about the inclusion of ads and the feasibility of payment methods for middle school students.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we should consider the following theoretical angles:
1. **Learning Sciences**: How does the community support collaborative learning and knowledge sharing?
2. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**: What are the user experience concerns and design considerations discussed?
3. **Participatory Design**: How do community members contribute to the design and improvement of the educational app?

Guiding questions:
- How do participants share knowledge and resources?
- What user experience issues are raised, and how are they addressed?
- In what ways do participants suggest and influence design decisions?

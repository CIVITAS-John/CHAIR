You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: analyze error messages, critiquing and improving error messages
- Participants read and consider error messages before making coding decisions, evaluate choices based on error messages, and analyze error messages.
- Participants critique error messages and request improved error messaging.

2.
Concepts: critiquing ai limitations, address ai system limitations
- Participants critique and discuss the limitations of AI systems, including capacity limitations.
- Participants address the limitations and uncertainties of AI-driven systems and current AI systems.

3.
Concepts: learning-curve, mentions learning curve
- Discusses the learning curve and challenges of working with AI
- The participant mentions the learning curve associated with using the AI system.

4.
Concepts: experiencing interface challenges, experiencing difficulties with interface design
- Participants experience interface challenges and attribute difficulties to design limitations.
- Participants experience struggles with unfamiliar design and express frustration with the learning curve.

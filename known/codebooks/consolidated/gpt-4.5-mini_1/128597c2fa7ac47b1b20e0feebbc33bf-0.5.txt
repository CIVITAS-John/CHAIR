You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: value instant feedback from ai, values timely feedback from ai
- Users appreciate the instant feedback provided by AI during coding tasks.
- Interviewees appreciate the AI's capacity to deliver timely feedback on code.

2.
Concepts: optimize and debug with ai assistance, optimize coding workflow with ai
- Interviewees utilize AI to evaluate and optimize their code during debugging.
- Interviewees describe how they use AI to improve their coding workflow and assist in programming tasks.

3.
Concepts: values error detection, detect errors with ai's help
- User values the AI's ability to detect errors that may not be immediately obvious to them.
- Interviewees recognize AI as a valuable tool for identifying overlooked errors.

4.
Concepts: misleading, identify ai validation limitations
- Users point out limitations of the AI, such as its inability to validate generated code or the accuracy of its information.
- Users recognize the inadequacies of AI in validating generated code against external standards.

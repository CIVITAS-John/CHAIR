You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary codes: @ morning tea moonlight how can i upload a high definition; uncensored version of this crappy avatar? > ** technical inquiry**: designer 1 seeks help with uploading a high definition avatar; possibly indicating a desire for customization or self expression within the community
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary codes: pc version? > ** platform inquiry**: user 4229 asks about a pc version; which might imply interest in accessing the community or resources through a desktop application
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary codes: i'll upload one now... are you a teacher? > ** technical assistance** and ** role identification**: designer 1 offers to upload the avatar and inquires about user 4229's role; possibly to understand their needs or to establish a connection
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary codes: yes. > ** role confirmation**: user 4229 confirms their role as a teacher; which could influence their expectations and interactions within the community
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: 
In this first round of coding, I aim to identify the initial interactions and intentions within the Physics Lab's online community. I will explore the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will examine how designers and users interact, share information, and express their needs and expectations. I will also investigate how the community's tone and dynamics emerge from these initial interactions.

Codes for each message:

1. **Image sharing**: Designer-2 shares an image, potentially setting a visual tone for the community.
2. **Technical inquiry**: Designer-1 seeks help with uploading a high-definition avatar, indicating a desire for customization or self-expression within the community.
3. **Platform inquiry**: User-4229 asks about a PC version, implying interest in accessing the community or resources through a desktop application.
4. **Technical assistance** and **Role identification**: Designer-1 offers technical help and inquires about User-4229's role, possibly to understand their needs or establish a connection.
5. **Role confirmation**: User-4229 confirms their role as a teacher, which could influence their expectations and interactions within the community.
6. **Community information**: Designer-1 shares important community information, such as the development plan and PC download address.
7. **Open invitation**: Designer-1 encourages users to share suggestions or requirements, fostering a participatory environment.
8. **Feature request**: User-4230 requests specific features, such as dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves and optical experiments, indicating their expectations from the community.
9. **Prioritization**: Designer-1 outlines the development priorities, indicating a focus on completing the electrical section first.
10. **Feedback solicitation**: Designer-1 expresses the need to gather opinions before starting mechanics, implying a willingness to incorporate user feedback.
11. **Appreciation**: User-4230 expresses gratitude for Designer-1's hard work.
12. **Platform inquiry**: User-4231 asks about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab, similar to User-4229's inquiry.
13. **Resource location**: User-4231 finds the group files, resolving their inquiry.

Summary:
The conversation begins with Designer-2 sharing an image, followed by Designer-1 seeking technical help and inquiring about User-4229's role. The conversation then shifts to discussions about the community's development plan, feature requests, and prioritization. Users express their needs and expectations, while designers provide information, technical assistance, and open invitations for feedback.

Notes:
* The conversation is characterized by a mix of technical inquiries, role identification, and open invitations for feedback, indicating a collaborative and participatory tone.
* Designers seem to prioritize understanding users' needs and expectations, while users express their requirements and expectations from the community.
* The conversation highlights the importance of technical assistance, platform accessibility, and feature development in shaping the community's dynamics.

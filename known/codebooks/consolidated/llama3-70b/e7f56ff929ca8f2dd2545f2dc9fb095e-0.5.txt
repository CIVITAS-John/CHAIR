You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: feature proposals, feature suggestions
- A user suggests or proposes a new feature or functionality.
- User suggests or requests new features or functionality for the software

2.
Concepts: information seeking
- A user asks a question or seeks clarification about a product or resource.
- User or designer asks a question or seeks clarification on a topic

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: feature proposals, feature suggestions
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts refer to users suggesting or proposing new features or functionalities)
Criteria: A user initiates a conversation or posts a message suggesting or proposing a new feature or functionality for the software.
Label: Feature Requests

2.
Concepts: information seeking
Relationship: Inclusion (one concept is a subset of the other, as users or designers asking questions or seeking clarification is a broader concept)
Criteria: A user or designer initiates a conversation or posts a message asking a question or seeking clarification about a product, resource, or topic.
Label: Inquiry

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: justifying development priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

2.
Label: potentially suggesting a solution
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

3.
Label: confirms that windows 7 is okay
Quotes:

18.
Label: expressing interest in specific topics
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

19.
Label: leaves room for exploration
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

20.
Label: reiterating the bidirectional conversion concept
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

21.
Label: question
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

22.
Label: mentions complexity of upcoming release
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

23.

Label: community need
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

32.
Label: promoting inclusivity
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

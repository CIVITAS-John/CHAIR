You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (32 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
32. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P4233: May I ask?
Preliminary tags: user inquiry; seeking guidance; assistance request
2. P8: Group sharing.
Preliminary tags: community feature suggestion; collaboration; group interaction
3. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
Preliminary tags: software download instructions; community engagement; platform usage
4. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
Preliminary tags: software update announcement; feature request; community feedback; platform development
5. P4234: [Emoji 56]
Preliminary tags: emoji
6. P4232: [Emoji 57][Emoji 57]
Preliminary tags: emoji use; non verbal communication
7. P4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer: Hello :)
9. P4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer: [Image 61] Updates in progress
11. Designer: This one is more complicated, so it will take some more time... Hopefully it will be ready for release this week
12. Designer: There will be: multimeter; energized screw tube; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem solving and middle school teaching)
13. P4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer: Have you encountered any problems during your use?
15. Designer: We try to design it to be usable without additional instructions, or we will provide some tips when you first open it based on feedback
16. P4235: Mainly for schools to build information technology schools
17. P4235: Need a user manual for this software
18. Designer: Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?
19. P4232: This is great, hoping it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams. Also, it would be great to have a function to hide the background grid with one click, making it easier for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no convenient software for drawing circuit diagrams for circuit-related questions.
20. Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later
22. P4235: You can also include mechanics experiments
23. Designer: For example, after connecting the physical diagram, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics is figured out; it will take some time
25. P4232: Oh, that's good
26. Designer: I hope to figure out electromagnetics before the end of the year
27. P4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do exercises in the application
29. P4234: It's starting to take shape [Emoji 80]
30. Designer: For example, connecting the circuit diagram to see the physical diagram, or vice versa
31. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer: Hmm.

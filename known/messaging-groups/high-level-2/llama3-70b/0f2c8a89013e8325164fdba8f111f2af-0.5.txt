Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...

1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Hello
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: There will be more people here after the official version is announced.
5. Designer: Probably because the teacher finds it annoying to talk too much ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image 6]
8. P5: ðŸ˜‚ Just to see if there are any good designs to draw inspiration from
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: Like a microcomputer

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a casual greeting, followed by the Designer's announcement about the upcoming official version of Physics Lab. The conversation then shifts to a discussion about design, with P5 expressing interest in drawing inspiration from others and P6 mentioning a microcomputer.

* Plan
This conversation can be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do participants establish a sense of community and shared purpose? How do designers facilitate or hinder this process? What role do technological affordances play in shaping the interaction?

# Community Building
## Greetings
Definition: Initial greetings and acknowledgments among participants.
- Example quote 1: "Hello" (P2)
- Example quote 2: "hello" (P1)
- Example quote 3: "hello" (Designer)

# Design and Feedback
## Design Inspiration
Definition: Expressions of interest in exploring or sharing design ideas.
- Example quote 1: "Just to see if there are any good designs to draw inspiration from" (P5)
- Example quote 2: "Good design?" (Designer)
- Example quote 3: "Like a microcomputer" (P6)

# Project Development
## Announcements
Definition: Official or unofficial announcements about the project's progress or milestones.
- Example quote 1: "There will be more people here after the official version is announced." (Designer)

# Humor and Tone
## Lightheartedness
Definition: Expressions of humor, playfulness, or irony.
- Example quote 1: "Tsk tsk tsk" (P1)
- Example quote 2: "Probably because the teacher finds it annoying to talk too much ðŸ˜‚" (Designer)

# Technology and Tools
## Technology References
Definition: Mentions of specific technologies, tools, or platforms.
- Example quote 1: "[Image 6]" (P4)

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. P16: ＋1
2. P10: What does "+1" mean?
3. P11: It means "me too".
4. P13: +1 means the same opinion
5. P13: emmmm
6. P13: You can search on Baidu
7. P10: Oh, I see, thank you.
8. P2: +1
9. P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for.
10. P17: I'm just looking.
11. P4: No problem.

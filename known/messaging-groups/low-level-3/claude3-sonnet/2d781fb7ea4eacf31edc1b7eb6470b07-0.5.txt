You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, which may produce some weird results.
Preliminary tags: prototype description; known issues; feature limitations
2. Designer: [Image 102]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
3. Designer: Thank you for your support. We will do better!
Preliminary tags: appreciation; commitment to improvement
4. P4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 104]
Preliminary tags: update inquiry; anticipation
5. Designer: There will be an update. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version next weekend.
Preliminary tags: release plan; cross platform development
6. Designer: The update is quite substantial...
Preliminary tags: significant update; progress
7. P4236: [Emoji 107]
8. P4234: [Emoji 108]
9. Designer: Don't worry, it will be done. We will optimize the circuit diagram in the final round.
10. Designer: Although manual layout adjustments are possible
11. Designer: It's still better to make the automatically generated one as good as possible
12. P4234: Yes, the spirit of continuous improvement like a skilled craftsman ðŸ¤”
13. Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that ensures long-term stability after implementation... Adding various components actually makes it simpler
14. Designer: The Apple Store is still under review, let's upload the PC version first
15. Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
Enhanced the 3D appearance of various types of meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeters and zero adjustment for meters.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments

Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal and real modes.

# Special Note

The Esc key now minimizes the window.

Ctrl+E can switch between exam and normal modes.
16. P4237: [Emoji 116]

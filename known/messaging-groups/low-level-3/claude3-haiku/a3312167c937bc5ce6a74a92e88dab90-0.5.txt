Summary of previous conversation: The conversation started with a participant (P13) suggesting that others can search on Baidu, which prompted a response from P10 acknowledging the suggestion. The discussion then shifted to various topics, including the need to pay for some items in the beaker (P14), community members' observations and reactions (P5, P17, P1, P4, P2), and a discussion about astronomy and the moon (P2, P11, P4). Throughout the conversation, participants engaged with each other's contributions, shared information and media, and sought clarification or additional details.
1. P11: üòÇ
Preliminary tags: community participation; reaction
2. P2: I'm talking about the software.
Preliminary tags: community participation; clarification
3. P11: Then ask the group owner.
Preliminary tags: community participation; referral
4. Designer: Mars is outside the Earth.
5. Designer: What's the problem?
6. P4: No problem.
7. P2: What about the moon?
8. P1: The moon is not depicted, right?
9. P14: Maybe it hasn't been done yet.
10. Designer: Last time there wasn't enough time.
11. P4: The moon is useless.
12. P4: üòÇ
13. Designer: It depends on the scale.
14. P2: Who said that?
15. P4: universe sandbox
16. Designer: There will be multiple presets.
17. Designer: Because in reality, you encounter various types of questions, many of which are about near-Earth space stations.
18. P11: Yes.
19. Designer: Artificial satellite orbits.
20. Designer: These will involve more.
21. Designer: Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter them often.
22. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
23. P1: John, have you become more Android?
24. Designer: No, update it today.
25. P17: [Image 126]
26. P2: Ë∞ÅÁü•ÈÅìÂºïÂäõÊ≥¢Êï¥‰πàÊµãÁöÑ
27. Designer: I'll buy one for space.
28. P17: It's the starry sky.
29. P1: Don't imitate it exactly.
30. P14: There are also software imitating celestial bodies on Steam.
31. P14: I can't remember if it's 78 or 79.
32. P14: [Image 133]
33. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
34. P11: Look it up online, this can't be solved in a few words.
35. P2: Can a motor be added?

Summary: The conversation has evolved from an initial suggestion about searching on Baidu to a more in-depth discussion about the design and development of the Physics Lab software, as well as broader topics related to astronomy and space exploration. Participants have engaged with each other, sharing information, seeking clarification, and reacting to various contributions. The discussion has touched on themes such as the need for presets, handling different types of space-related questions, the representation of celestial bodies, and the potential for additional features like motors. The community members have also shared relevant media, such as images, and have acknowledged limitations in their own knowledge or memory. Overall, the conversation demonstrates an active and engaged online community exploring the various aspects of the Physics Lab software and its broader context.

Notes: The conversation suggests that the online community around the Physics Lab software is actively engaged and interested in the design and development of the application. Participants are not only providing feedback and suggestions but also sharing their own knowledge and experiences related to astronomy and space exploration. This level of engagement and knowledge-sharing indicates a strong sense of community and a shared interest in the project. The discussion also highlights the importance of considering different perspectives, such as the need to handle various types of space-related questions and the representation of celestial bodies, in the design and development of the software. The community's input and participation can be valuable for the designer in refining and improving the Physics Lab application.

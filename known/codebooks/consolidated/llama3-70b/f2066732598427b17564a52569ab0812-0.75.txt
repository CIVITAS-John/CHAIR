You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1.
Concepts: identifies learning curve, discusses learning curve
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as identifying a learning curve implies discussing the difficulties and challenges associated with it.
Criteria: Participants identify and discuss the difficulties or learning curves they face when using LLM-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Identify learning curve difficulties

2.
Concepts: valuing ai feedback, suggesting ai improvements
Relationship: The two concepts are logically connected, as valuing AI feedback implies recognizing its potential and suggesting ways to improve it.
Criteria: Participants appreciate AI feedback and propose improvements to enhance its effectiveness.
Phrase: Value and improve AI feedback

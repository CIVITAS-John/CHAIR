You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (19 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
19. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: outlining a plan for simulated experiment assessment; detailing experimental features; highlighting the importance of zero adjustment
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: expressing enthusiasm; praising the idea; showing appreciation for the designer's vision
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: promising user involvement; soliciting feedback; ensuring collective decision making
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: seeking input from teachers; inquiring about current textbook practices; gathering information for design decisions
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: sharing visual examples; illustrating intersection types; seeking confirmation or correction
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirming the commonality of the old style; providing feedback; offering insight into prevailing practices
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: 
The conversation revolves around the design and development of Physics Lab, with a focus on simulated experiment assessment and circuit diagram features. Designers involve users in the design process, seeking input and feedback on various aspects of the design. Users respond with enthusiasm, providing valuable insights and suggestions that inform design decisions. The conversation reveals a collaborative and iterative design process, with designers and users working together to create a learning environment that meets users' needs and expectations.

Notes: 
The designers seem to be committed to participatory design, involving users in the decision-making process and valuing their feedback. The conversation highlights the importance of simplicity and usability in design, as well as the need for designers to consider multiple perspectives and prevailing practices. The update timeline and release plans suggest that the design process is ongoing, with a focus on continuous improvement and refinement.

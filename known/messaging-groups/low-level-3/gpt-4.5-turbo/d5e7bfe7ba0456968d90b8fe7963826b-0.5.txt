46. Designer: You can make some interesting components, but normal experiments shouldn't be done like this...
47. P11: ðŸ˜‚ That's in electronic circuits.
48. P11: I don't understand either.
49. P2: It's in the CPU.
50. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned some when I took an optional course in circuits.
51. P2: Add a capacitive divider.
52. P2: I learned it by myself.
53. P11: That's great, especially if you have a hobby in it.
54. P14: @P11 Are there still distinctions between arts and sciences now?
55. P2: no
56. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
57. P14: [Image 191]
58. P14: ...Let me pass the exam first.
59. P2: I'm still in the second year of junior high school.
60. P11: Keep it up.
61. P13: From freshman year in high school.
62. P2: What about MOSFETs?
63. P2: @Designer 
64. P17: [Image 198]
65. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used with test tubes?
66. P2: +1

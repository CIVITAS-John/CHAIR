You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
2. {Repeat the input 2}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 2}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 2}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 2}

~~~
1. user support, interactive support
- Designers or users provide support, respond to user questions/issues, gather user feedback, or provide instructions for using Physics Lab
- Instances where designers engage directly with users to solve problems, answer questions, or provide personalized assistance related to the Physics Lab software.

2. user involvement, participatory decision-making
- The extent to which users are involved in the design and development process of Physics Lab
- Designers actively involve community members in decision-making processes related to the design and features of Physics Lab

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1. user support, interactive support
Relationship: Overlapping concepts, where interactive support is a more specific instance of user support.
Criteria: Designers or users provide support, respond to user questions/issues, gather user feedback, or provide instructions for using Physics Lab, including direct engagement to solve problems, answer questions, or provide personalized assistance.
Label: Support and Assistance

2. user involvement, participatory decision-making
Relationship: Overlapping concepts, where participatory decision-making is a more specific instance of user involvement.
Criteria: Designers actively involve community members in decision-making processes related to the design and features of Physics Lab, including soliciting feedback and incorporating user input.
Label: User Engagement and Participation

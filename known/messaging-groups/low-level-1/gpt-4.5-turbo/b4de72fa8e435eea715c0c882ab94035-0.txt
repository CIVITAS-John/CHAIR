1. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, and may produce some weird results.
2. Designer: [Image]
3. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
4. P4234: Will there be updates this week? [Emoji]
5. Designer: There will be updates. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version over the weekend.
6. Designer: The update is quite substantial...
7. P4236: [Emoji]
8. P4234: [Emoji]
9. Designer: Don't worry, it will be there, in the final optimization round of the circuit diagram.
10. Designer: Although manual layout adjustments are possible
11. Designer: But it's still better to make the automatically generated one as good as possible
12. P4234: Yes, the spirit of continuous improvement like a skilled craftsman ðŸ¤”
13. Designer: This belongs to the kind of function that ensures long-term stability after it's done... It's actually simpler to add various components.
14. Designer: The Apple Store is still under review, let's upload the PC version first.
15. Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: experiencing frustration with ai limitations, expresses frustration with ai error messages
- Participants experience frustration with AI's failure to fix errors.
- Participants express disappointment with the LLM-driven interface due to receiving incorrect or unclear error messages.

2.
Concepts: using ai-generated code, selectively using ai-generated code
- Participants decide to use AI-generated code in their workflow.
- Participants selectively use generated code or model components.

3.
Concepts: interpreting ai-generated code, evaluating ai-generated code
- Participants summarize and interpret AI-generated code.
- Participants evaluate ChatGPT's code, reading and assessing generated code.

4.
Concepts: uses ai for debugging, fixing ai code errors
- Participants use AI to debug code and fix errors.
- Participants fix errors or issues in AI-generated code.

5.
Concepts: learning through practice, emphasizing debugging skills
- Highlighting the need for users to practice debugging their own code.
- Participants emphasize the importance of users practicing debugging their own code before seeking AI assistance.

6.
Concepts: addressing novice challenges
- The participant addresses novice challenges, such as the lack of debugging or design skills.
- Participants discuss the challenges faced by novice users and how AI might address them.

Here are the formatted codes with definitions:

---
1.
Concepts: experiencing frustration with ai limitations, expresses frustration with ai error messages
Relationship: The two concepts are causally related, as the limitations of AI lead to frustration, which is then expressed through disappointment with error messages.
Criteria: Participants experience and express frustration with AI limitations and error messages.
Phrase: Expressing frustration with AI limitations.

2.
Concepts: using ai-generated code, selectively using ai-generated code
Relationship: The two concepts are synonymous, as using AI-generated code implies being selective in one's use of it.
Criteria: Participants use AI-generated code in their workflow, selectively incorporating it into their process.
Phrase: Using AI-generated code selectively.

3.
Concepts: interpreting ai-generated code, evaluating ai-generated code
Relationship: The two concepts are sequentially related, as interpreting AI-generated code is a necessary step before evaluating its quality.
Criteria: Participants interpret and evaluate AI-generated code to assess its suitability for their needs.
Phrase: Evaluating AI-generated code.

4.
Concepts: uses ai for debugging, fixing ai code errors
Relationship: The two concepts are causally related, as using AI for debugging leads to fixing errors in AI-generated code.
Criteria: Participants use AI to debug code and fix errors in AI-generated code.
Phrase: Debugging with AI.

5.
Concepts: learning through practice, emphasizing debugging skills
Relationship: The two concepts are sequentially related, as learning through practice is a means of developing debugging skills.
Criteria: Participants emphasize the importance of practicing debugging skills to improve coding abilities.
Phrase: Emphasizing debugging skills.

6.
Concepts: addressing novice challenges
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants address the challenges faced by novice users, such as lacking debugging or design skills.
Phrase: Addressing novice challenges.

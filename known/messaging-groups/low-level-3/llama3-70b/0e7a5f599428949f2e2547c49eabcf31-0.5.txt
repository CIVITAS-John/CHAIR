You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Thoughts: For the analysis of this conversation, I plan to explore the emergence of the Physics Lab online community through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will examine how the designer and users interact, share ideas, and collaborate. I will also investigate how the community norms and expectations are established. Guiding questions include: How does the designer facilitate community engagement? How do users contribute to the development of Physics Lab? What are the key features and functionalities that users request?

Tags for each message:
1. user background; teaching experience; middle school context; educator perspective
2. software development; version update; release timeline; apple market; product development
3. apology; community engagement; empathy; social norms; designer-user interaction
4. inquiry; technical issue; download process; user support; resource access
5. apology; politeness; community norms; social etiquette; user interaction
6. feature request; group sharing; collaborative learning; social learning; community features
7. resource sharing; community resources; download instructions; designer support
8. software development; feature update; user feedback; community engagement; participatory design
9. emotional expression; community atmosphere; user emotions; emotional support
10. emotional expression; community atmosphere; user emotions; emotional support; social bonding

Summary: The conversation starts with users introducing themselves, followed by the designer announcing an update to Physics Lab. The conversation then shifts to users requesting features and support, with the designer responding to their inquiries. The designer also encourages user feedback and participation in the development process. Throughout the conversation, users and the designer engage in polite and empathetic interactions, establishing a positive community atmosphere.

Notes: It appears that the designer is actively engaging with users, responding to their requests, and encouraging their participation in the development process. Users are also establishing community norms, such as apologizing for minor disturbances. The conversation suggests a collaborative and supportive community is emerging.

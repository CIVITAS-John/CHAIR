You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

2.
Label: estimating development timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

More realistic 3D appearance for various meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeter and meter zeroing.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments
Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal/realistic modes.

# Special Tips
The Esc shortcut key will now minimize the window.
The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.

Label: emphasizing ease of use
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

7.
Label: suggesting usability improvements
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

8.
Label: outlining timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

9.
Label: explaining design decisions
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

10.
Label: weighing trade offs
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

11.
Label: identifying potential issues
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

Label: breaking the ice
Quotes:
- User: Hello everyone

13.
Label: assessing feasibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?
- Designer: 7 is okay.

14.
Label: discussing design goals
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

15.
Label: showing understanding
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.
- Designer: Hmm hmm.
- User: Indeed
- User: ok

16.
Label: setting realistic timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

17.
Label: sharing research goals
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

18.
Label: updating users on platform developments
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

19.
Label: responding to feature requests
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

20.
Label: validating designer's experience
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.
- User: Indeed

21.
Label: demonstrating domain expertise
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

22.
Label: highlighting potential use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

23.
Label: explaining school's internet policy
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

Label: demonstrating commitment
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in the Physics Lab online community continues to evolve, with members discussing astronomy, software, and technical aspects related to space exploration. There is a mix of factual statements, questions, and expressions of appreciation, confusion, and humor. The Designer plays a significant role in guiding the conversation towards upcoming topics and future features, while members actively engage through sharing images, seeking clarification, and suggesting improvements.
1. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
Preliminary tags: self deprecating humor
2. P11: Look it up online, this is not something that can be solved in a few words. @P2 
Preliminary tags: suggestion to seek information online
3. P2: Can we add a motor? @Designer 
Preliminary tags: seeking input on technical aspects
4. P14: I think I should focus on doing mathematics.
5. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
6. Designer: We will be relatively simple, practical (close to the exam), and affordable.
7. P11: 2333
8. P11: Ask the group owner.
9. Designer: After all, it's not specifically about astronomy.
10. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
11. P2: [Image 144]
12. P2: From what I know currently.
13. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in the Physics Lab?
14. Designer: Motor simulation is more complicated, and it depends on the load.
15. Designer: Calculated it...
16. P2: How was it calculated?
17. P11: Okay.
18. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
19. P11: [Image 152]
20. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but an atomized model.
21. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
22. P1: Server?
23. P11: Hahaha
24. Designer: Standalone.
25. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
26. Designer: Two types of motors.
27. P1: Are you going to the server?
28. P2: Brushed motor.
29. P2: It's not a brushless motor that connects to AC.
30. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
31. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
32. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
33. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
34. P14: [Image 168]
35. P2: Has it been burned?

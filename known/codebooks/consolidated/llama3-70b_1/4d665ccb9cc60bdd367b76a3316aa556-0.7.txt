You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: expresses gratitude for something unspecified
Quotes:
- User: Thank you.

2.
Label: reiterate bidirectional conversion
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

3.
Label: provided immediate assistance
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

4.
Label: respond to user query
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

5.
Label: technical issue
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

6.
Label: planned for improvement
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

7.
Label: justifying development priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

8.
Label: give response to mitigate the concern
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

9.
Label: reaction to rejection
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

10.
Label: clarifying version details
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

11.
Label: promoting open communication within the community
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

12.
Label: explanation
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

13.
Label: suggesting collaboration
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

14.
Label: describing the research on bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

15.
Label: ask followup question on usage scenario
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

16.
Label: participated in community building
Quotes:
- User: Hello everyone

17.
Label: designer 1 shares image
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

18.
Label: reach a conclusion for the solution based on user's response
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

19.
Label: inform about system compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.
- User: Win7 should be fine.

20.
Label: acknowledged interaction limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

21.
Label: version update notes
Quotes:
- Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

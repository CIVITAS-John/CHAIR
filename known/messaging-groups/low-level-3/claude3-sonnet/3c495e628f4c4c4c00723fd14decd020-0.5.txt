You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)

Thoughts: This conversation seems to revolve around the meaning and usage of the "+1" expression in this online community. To analyze it from multiple angles:

Learning sciences: How are community norms and practices like "+1" established and transmitted to newcomers? What role does seeking clarification play in the learning process?

Human-computer interaction: How does the text-based, asynchronous nature of this communication affect the exchange? Are there design opportunities to better support shared understanding of community conventions?

Participatory design: How can community members be involved in shaping norms and practices like "+1" to align with their needs and values? Should the meaning evolve based on this discussion?

Tags for each message:
1. self-deprecation; humility; in-group identification
2. agreement; affirmation; in-group identification  
3. agreement; affirmation; following community norms
4. agreement; minimal response
5. seeking clarification; inquiring about community norms
6. explaining community norms; clarifying meaning
7. defining community norms; explaining meaning  
8. preface; transition
9. referring to external resource; suggesting further research

Summary: The conversation starts with several people using "+1" to seemingly agree with P14's self-deprecating comment. P10 then asks what "+1" means, prompting P11 and P13 to explain that it signifies agreement or having the same opinion. P13 also suggests checking an external resource (Baidu) to learn more about the expression's meaning and usage in this community.

Notes: This exchange illustrates how community norms and shorthand like "+1" can be opaque to newcomers, necessitating clarification and socialization. The participants seem to recognize "+1" as an established practice, though there may be nuances in how it is interpreted. Designing better ways to surface and negotiate such conventions could smooth the onboarding process. Involving community members in discussing the meaning and appropriateness of "+1" could also lead to evolving or diversifying its usage.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* academic focus
* astronomy engagement
* business model
* communication strategies
* community development
* community interaction & involvement
* community norms & dynamics
* design perspective
* feedback processes
* human-computer interaction
* information seeking
* interdisciplinary learning
* knowledge sharing
* learning components & environment
* learning support
* operational aspects
* software development impact
* technical performance
* technology exploration
* time management
* user engagement levels
* user experience

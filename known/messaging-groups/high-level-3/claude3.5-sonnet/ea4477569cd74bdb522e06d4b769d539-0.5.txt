Here's a codebook analysis based on the given interaction:

---
* Summary
This conversation involves a designer asking about uploading a high-definition avatar, and a brief exchange with a user who identifies as a teacher. The context appears to be related to Physics Lab's online community.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we'll focus on aspects of community building, user engagement, and platform development. We'll examine how designers interact with users, how they address technical issues, and how they gather information about their user base. Key questions to consider: How do designers facilitate user engagement? How do they address platform improvements? How do they identify and cater to specific user groups like educators?

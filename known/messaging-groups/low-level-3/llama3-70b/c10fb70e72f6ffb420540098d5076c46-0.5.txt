You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. P13: First year of high school
Preliminary tags: age revelation; personal information
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
Preliminary tags: mosfe ts inquiry; technical detail
3. P2: @Designer 
Preliminary tags: @designer; technical inquiry
4. P17: [Image 1-198]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
Preliminary tags: potassium permanganate reference; chemistry knowledge
6. P2: +1
Preliminary tags: agreement expression; community bonding
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 1-202]
9. P14: How do you say it?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, they heat up quickly and save materials. But this is also fine, if you're a bit extravagant, you can cover a fish tank and connect a tube ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Won't the condensed liquid flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid has already been heated during reflux, making it less likely to break
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry things, probably won't be able to touch it before the second half of the year..
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be exactly the same as in the books, although during exams...
20. P1: There isn't any relatively realistic chemistry software at the moment
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was okay
22. Designer: But even the gods of organic chemistry can't solve it
23. Designer: So if you want to do it, you still have to consider it from the exam perspective
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section on electricity will have it, such as charged operations)
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a larger amount of computation...
32. P1: If you have the ability to make a comprehensive and free one, it should be very popular

Summary:
This conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community, where participants engage in discussions about chemistry and physics-related topics. The Designer is actively involved, providing insights and updates on the project. Participants share knowledge, ask questions, and explore technical details. The conversation touches on laboratory equipment, chemistry experiments, and educational resources. The community exhibits social cues, such as agreement expressions and emotional responses, indicating a sense of camaraderie and shared interest.

Notes:
It's interesting to observe how the community navigates technical topics, with participants seeking clarification and sharing knowledge. The Designer's involvement adds a layer of expertise and guidance, while also providing insight into the project's development. I'll continue to explore how the community emerges and evolves, examining the interplay between learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

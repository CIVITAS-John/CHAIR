You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

4.
Label: hypothesize compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

5.
Label: requesting private communication for requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

6.
Label: encourage problem reporting
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

7.
Label: explaining development challenges
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

8.

- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

12.
Label: user 4232 highlights practical application
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

13.
Label: described classroom experience
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

14.

- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

23.
Label: designer 1 sets scope
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

24.
Label: inquiring about user's profession
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

25.
Label: acknowledge limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

26.
Label: highlighting user interface challenges
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

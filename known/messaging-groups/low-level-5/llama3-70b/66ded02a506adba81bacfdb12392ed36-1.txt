You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Preliminary phrases: sharing personal experience; suggesting workarounds; highlighting technical nuances
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: expressing agreement; acknowledging understanding; validating designer's experience
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: suggesting new features; advocating for teacher needs; highlighting convenience
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: committing to future updates; prioritizing teacher requests; promising future functionality
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about classroom context; exploring technical constraints; considering user needs
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: sharing institutional constraints; explaining internet limitations; highlighting security concerns
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Thoughts: 
In this first round of coding, I will focus on understanding the dynamics of the online community and identifying the key themes related to the emergence of Physics Lab's online community. I will examine the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will pay attention to how designers and users interact, what features are being discussed, and what concerns are being raised. I will also consider the institutional and technical contexts that shape the community's development.

Summary:
The conversation revolves around the early stages of Physics Lab's online community, with designers and users discussing technical features, user needs, and institutional constraints. Designers are committing to future updates, prioritizing teacher requests, and considering technical limitations. Users are sharing their teaching experiences, providing context for user needs, and evaluating software effectiveness. The conversation highlights the importance of understanding the classroom context, technical constraints, and user needs for the emergence of the online community.

Notes:
The conversation reveals a collaborative and participatory dynamic between designers and users. Designers are receptive to user feedback and committed to incorporating user needs into the design process. Users are actively engaging with the software, providing feedback, and shaping the community's development. The institutional and technical contexts are key factors influencing the community's growth, with internet access and security concerns being prominent issues. As the analysis proceeds, it will be essential to examine how these factors continue to shape the online community's emergence.

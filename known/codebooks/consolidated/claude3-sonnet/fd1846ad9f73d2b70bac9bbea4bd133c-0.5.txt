You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. usability issues and concerns, user feedback and experience.
- Users highlighting usability problems, compatibility issues, or concerns related to the software's usability, interface, or user experience. Issues related to the usability, accessibility, and user interface design of the software.
- Users providing suggestions, reporting issues, or sharing their experiences with the software. Gathering input, requirements, or feedback from users to improve the software's design, features, or overall user experience. Comments or feedback related to usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.

2. designer-user collaboration, user involvement in design.
- Interactions or exchanges between the designer and users, indicating collaboration or co-design processes.
- Instances where the designer explicitly invites user input, feedback, or involvement in the design or development process. Evidence of co-creation, soliciting feedback, or involving users in design decisions.

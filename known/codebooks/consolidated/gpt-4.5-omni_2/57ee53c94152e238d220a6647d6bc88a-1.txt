Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

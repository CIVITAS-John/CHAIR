You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: outline future feature plans; emphasize educational value; enhance experimental detail
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: affirm positive sentiment; endorse design ideas; strengthen community support
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: commit to community consultation; emphasize collaborative approach; foster inclusivity in decision making
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: seek input from educators; validate community expertise; enhance relevance of designs
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: verify understanding; confirm design choices; promote collaborative validation
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: acknowledge common practices; validate user feedback; enhance community knowledge sharing
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation reveals a collaborative effort in the development of features for the Physics Lab online community, with designers actively engaging users for their input and feedback on design elements, particularly regarding circuit diagrams. Users express their opinions and preferences, which are acknowledged and incorporated into the design process. The designers emphasize transparency, inclusivity, and iterative design, fostering a supportive community atmosphere. The conversation also hints at upcoming updates, further engaging the community's interest and anticipation.

Notes: The interaction showcases the principles of participatory design, with a strong emphasis on community involvement and feedback loops. The designers' commitment to consulting users and educators suggests an intention to create a more relevant and effective educational tool. Future analyses might explore how the community's feedback influences design decisions and how this process impacts user engagement over time. Additionally, examining the emotional tone of the exchanges could provide insights into community dynamics.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: providing rationale, reason for suggestion
- User provides a reason or explanation for a feature request
- User provides a reason or explanation for a suggestion or request.

2.
Concepts: iterative design, iterative development approach
- Continuously improving and updating the design based on feedback.
- Designers engage in an iterative development process, refining and expanding software capabilities based on user feedback

3.
Concepts: future update commitment, future development promises
- The designer commits to including a feature or update in the future.
- A designer promises to make a feature available at a later time, promising or committing to future development or features, expressing a desire to explore a specific topic or feature in the future.

4.
Concepts: prioritizing development
- Prioritizing tasks, features, or development goals, and informing users of the sequence and focus of upcoming development efforts.
- The process of deciding which sections of the platform to focus on based on user feedback.

5.
Concepts: encouraging community participation
- Participating in the online community, sharing thoughts or opinions.
- Designers fostering a sense of community and inviting user participation, including sharing ideas and feedback.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: providing rationale, reason for suggestion
Relationship: Parallel (two concepts are related but distinct, describing the same phenomenon)
Criteria: Users provide explanations or justifications for their feature requests or suggestions.
Label: Justifying Requests

2.
Concepts: iterative design, iterative development approach
Relationship: Inclusion (iterative design is a part of iterative development approach)
Criteria: Designers continuously refine and expand software capabilities based on user feedback.
Label: Feedback-Driven Development

3.
Concepts: future update commitment, future development promises
Relationship: Parallel (two concepts are related but distinct, describing the same phenomenon)
Criteria: Designers commit to or promise to include features or updates in the future.
Label: Future Development Commitments

4.
Concepts: prioritizing development
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Designers prioritize tasks, features, or development goals and inform users of their focus.
Label: Development Prioritization

5.
Concepts: encouraging community participation
Relationship: Inclusion (designers fostering a sense of community is a part of encouraging user participation)
Criteria: Designers invite user participation, including sharing ideas and feedback, to foster a sense of community.
Label: Fostering Community Engagement

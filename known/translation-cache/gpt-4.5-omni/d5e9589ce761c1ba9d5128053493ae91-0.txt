1. # 新的特性
电子元件会在一个短暂的过程后损坏，而非立即损坏。清空桌面现在会显示一个确认界面。支持撤销导线、元件的创建和删除。用电器现在显示交变电流的有效值。(PC) 可以通过 Esc 键退出应用了。# 新的元件新增了灵敏电流计。新增了学生电源（交直流理想电源）。# 元件性质的调整干电池现在拥有可调节的内阻，不再是理想电源。白炽灯泡现在拥有伏安特性参数，不再是理想电阻。电阻定律实验器现在采用真实公式计算，参数可调。隐藏了接线板 3 和 4。# BUG 修复修复了Editor属性时单位换算导致的问题。接线柱箭头不再显示跳跃动画。某些电路接法可能存在运算错误的问题。

2. 建议pc版增加一个退出按键功能，现在很多地区都用的是触屏一体机，没有实体键盘
---
3. 嗯嗯。。。下一次更新的时候补上。PC 更新一般是最快的，估计这周末又会有一轮
---
4. 话说这样的话岂不是每个输入数字的地方都应该加个软键盘
---
5. 触屏都有自己的屏幕键盘
---
6. 但没法在不碰input的时候呼出来，大概是这样吧
---
7. 我上次在初中试过，现在有一个比较取巧的办法就是点右上那个链接按钮，弹出浏览器之后就不是全屏了……= =
---
8. @3 是的是的
---
9. 如果能有导出功能，或者是保存实验或导入实验，就方便了，咱可以在办公室把参数弄好了，在班上直接导入就行了
---
10. 会有的
---
11. 班上有网络吗？
---
12. 一般没有，我们这儿自从有一次大市级公开课上课时，蹦出来个成人图片，学校就关闭了班级电脑的网络[Emoji]

1. New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

2. It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
---
3. Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
---
4. Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
---
5. Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
---
6. But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
---
7. Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
---
8. @3 Yes, yes.
---
9. If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
---
10. There will be.
---
11. Does the class have internet?
---
12. Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

1. announcements, feature announcements.
- The designer provides updates about software versions and new features.
- Instances where the designer announces new features or improvements in the software.

2. user requests, feature requests.
- Instances where users make specific requests or suggestions for new features or content.
- Instances where users request specific new features or components to be included in the software.

3. designer-user interaction, collaborative design.
- Interactions where designers actively seek and respond to user feedback.
- Instances where the designer involves users in the design process by seeking their input or feedback.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
4. User-4233: How to download?
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
6. Designer-2: Group sharing.
7. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

* Summary
The conversation involves a group of users and designers discussing the development and features of Physics Lab, an online platform for teaching and learning physics. The users express interest in downloading the software and suggest features they would like to see in future updates. The designers provide information about the software's availability and upcoming features, as well as encourage users to share their ideas for future development.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, I will focus on themes such as user engagement, collaboration, and feedback. I will look for evidence of how users and designers interact to create a shared understanding of the platform's purpose and functionality. Additionally, I will consider how the platform supports learning and teaching, as well as how user feedback is incorporated into the design process.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: analyzing the problem
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

2.
Label: testing phase
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

3.
Label: confirmation the developer's whole argument
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

4.
Label: reach a conclusion for the solution based on user's response

Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software
- User: Is there a user manual?

8.
Label: inquire about update timeline
Quotes:
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]

9.
Label: future update
Quotes:

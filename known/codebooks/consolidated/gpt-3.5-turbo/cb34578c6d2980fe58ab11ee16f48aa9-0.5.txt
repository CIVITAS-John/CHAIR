You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Label: user inquiry about software update
Quotes:
- Has the Android version not been updated yet?
- Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]

2.
Label: software update schedule
Quotes:
- There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

Label: software download
Quotes:
- [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- You can download Windows in the group files.
- How to download?

4.
Label: software version
Quotes:
- The one in the group is the PC version
- PC version?

5.
Label: software functionality description
Quotes:
- For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

6.
Label: user guidance on software usage
Quotes:
- After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch
- Although you can manually adjust the layout

7.
Label: user manual inquiry
Quotes:
- Need the user manual for this software
- Is there a user manual?

8.
Label: user support
Quotes:
- We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
- [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

9.
Label: feature request
Quotes:
- This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Can you also include mechanics experiments?

10.
Label: user suggestion
Quotes:
- It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- It seems that local export needs to be supported.

Quotes:
- We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

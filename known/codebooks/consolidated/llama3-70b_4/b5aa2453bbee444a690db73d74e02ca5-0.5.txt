You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1.
Concepts: debugging code manually, debug code manually and silently
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both describe participants taking an autonomous approach to debugging, without relying on AI explanations.
Criteria: Participants independently debug code without AI assistance, identifying errors through manual and silent processes.
Phrase: Debugging code autonomously

2.
Concepts: relies on ai for troubleshooting, seeking ai help with troubleshooting
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both describe participants seeking external assistance from AI in the troubleshooting process.
Criteria: Participants use AI as a resource to overcome obstacles, copying and pasting error messages or getting stuck on less obvious issues.
Phrase: Seeking AI assistance

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

* Summary
This conversation in the Physics Lab online message group shows a discussion around the meaning of the "+1" expression, which is used to indicate agreement or support for a previous message. The participants explain the meaning of "+1" and provide additional context around the discussion.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Learning Sciences: Examine how the participants engage in knowledge sharing and collaborative learning within the online community.
2. Human-Computer Interaction: Investigate the role of the online platform and its affordances in facilitating the discussion and community interactions.
3. Participatory Design: Explore how the participants contribute to the development and shaping of the online community through their interactions.

# Knowledge Sharing and Collaborative Learning

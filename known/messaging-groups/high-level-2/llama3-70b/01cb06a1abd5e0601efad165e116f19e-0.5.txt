Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P2: [Image 30]
2. P2: Just press the button with the wire
3. P7: Oh
4. P9: [Image 33]
5. P9: How to make it work
6. Designer: ï¼Ÿ
7. P9: [Checkin 37]
8. P9: [Checkin 38]
9. P10: Hello everyone, I am a new member. Nice to meet you all. Thank you.
10. P11: Seeking advice on a question.
11. P11: [Image 41]
12. P11: This is a rectifier circuit.
13. P11: The verification should be correct.
14. P11: However,
15. P11: [Image 45]
16. P11: The image is not as expected.
17. P11: Not sure if it's a circuit problem or a software bug, seeking advice.
18. P11: [Image 48]
19. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
20. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
21. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits, so I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know, so please enlighten me in the future. Thank you.
22. P4: Has it been updated?
23. P11: It's not ideal...
24. P11: I will consider the impedance.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab's online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with P2 sharing an image and giving instructions to others. P9 responds with an image and asks how to make it work. The conversation then shifts to P11 seeking advice on a question about a rectifier circuit. The designer provides guidance, and P10 introduces themselves and apologizes for not knowing physics yet. The conversation continues with discussions about the circuit and impedance.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do community members facilitate learning and knowledge sharing? How do they use images and other multimedia to communicate? What roles do designers and experts play in the community?

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

* Summary
This conversation involves a designer from Physics Lab discussing upcoming features and updates with users, particularly focusing on electricity simulations and circuit diagram representations. The designer seeks input from users, especially teachers, about current textbook standards for circuit diagrams. There's a collaborative exchange about which style of intersection to use in the diagrams, and the designer shares a test version of the circuit diagram editor. The conversation concludes with information about upcoming updates across different platforms.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we'll focus on aspects of community emergence, collaborative design, and user engagement. We'll examine how the designers involve users in the development process, how feedback is exchanged, and how the community contributes to the evolution of Physics Lab. Key questions to consider include: How does the designer facilitate user participation? How do users contribute to the design process? What evidence is there of community building and engagement? We'll analyze the conversation through the lenses of participatory design, human-computer interaction, and learning sciences principles.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: revealing potential usability challenges
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

2.
Label: designer 1 communicates project timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

3.

Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

4.

6.
Label: initiated design discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

7.
Label: seek clarification
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

8.
Label: linked feature to teaching needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

9.
Label: user 4232 builds rapport
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

10.
Label: demonstrating openness to user input
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

11.

Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

16.
Label: explaining the focus on electricity and mechanics
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

17.
Label: providing the update timeline for various platform versions
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

20.
Label: use non verbal communication
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

21.

23.
Label: provide context about school resources
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

24.
Label: demonstrating physics knowledge
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

25.
Label: informed about ongoing research
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

26.
Label: justify request for manual
Quotes:
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

27.
Label: highlighting security concerns in educational settings
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

28.
Label: designer 1 considers technical solution
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

29.
Label: involve teachers in design process
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Label: expresses satisfaction with platform progress
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

32.
Label: set expectations

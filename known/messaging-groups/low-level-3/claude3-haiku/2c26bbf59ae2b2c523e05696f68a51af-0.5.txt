Summary of previous conversation: The conversation explores the development and evolution of the Physics Lab online community, with the Designer providing insights and guidance throughout the discussion. The participants discuss various topics related to physics and chemistry experiments, such as superconductors, computational power, and chemistry software. They also explore potential features like light-sensitive components, pressure-sensitive resistors, and monetization options like ads and subscription fees. The conversation touches on the challenges of creating realistic chemistry software, the focus on the exam perspective in the Physics Lab platform, and the potential ways to improve the community and make it more accessible and comprehensive.
1. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
Preliminary tags: monetization; top up
2. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
Preliminary tags: 3d touch
3. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?
Preliminary tags: in app purchase
4. P14: It seems a bit troublesome.
5. P2: ……
6. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now.
7. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.
8. Designer: That's true.
9. Designer: Let's just click on ads, hh.
10. P14: Yes, that's fine.
11. P2: What's wrong with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
12. P2: A middle schooler is better than you.
13. P11: I just hope that ads won't take up too much space on the interface.
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood.
15. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method.
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: The ads won't be permanent.
19. Designer: We just want you to click on ads to earn points, and then use the points to unlock new content.
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come and hit me along the network cable.
21. P2: I know how to code.
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 280]
24. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is really annoying.
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen isn't big and it's still got psoriasis.
27. P2: It even forces you to click.
28. P2: What do you need ads for, @Designer 
29. Designer: Health...
30. Designer: Doing this requires hiring people...
31. P1: It's free.
32. Designer: Actually, it's similar to charging money, but if you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay...
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do more of it.
35. Designer: There are some other ways as well.

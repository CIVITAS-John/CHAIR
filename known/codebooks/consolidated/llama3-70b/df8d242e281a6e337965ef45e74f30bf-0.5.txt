You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: collaborative design, collaborative design process
- The collaboration between designers and users in the design process.
- Designers and users work together to shape the final product, with users playing an active role in design decisions.

2.
Concepts: feedback integration
- Designers express the intention to gather and incorporate user feedback into the development process, acknowledging and incorporating user feedback into design decisions.
- Users provide suggestions and feedback, and designers respond to and implement them in future updates.

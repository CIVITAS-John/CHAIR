You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
Tags should be descriptive of the event and its context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary tags: feature request; physics experiment simulation; user needs
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary tags: development prioritization; feature development; designer response
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: user feedback; participatory design; development prioritization
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; community gratitude
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary tags: platform inquiry; pc version availability; interactive whiteboard
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary tags: platform navigation; group files; user support
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: In this conversation, I plan to analyze the emergence of the Physics Lab online community through the lens of participatory design, human-computer interaction, and learning sciences. I will examine how users and designers interact, prioritize features, and provide feedback. I will also explore how the community navigates the platform and accesses resources. Guiding questions include: How do users and designers collaborate in shaping the Physics Lab platform? What features are prioritized, and how are they developed? How do users navigate the platform, and what support do they receive?

Tags for each message:
1. feature request; physics experiment simulation; user needs; dynamic demonstration; mechanical waves; wave superposition; diffraction; interference
2. development prioritization; feature development; designer response; electrical section; magnetism
3. user feedback; participatory design; development prioritization; mechanics; opinion gathering
4. appreciation; community gratitude; acknowledgement
5. platform inquiry; pc version availability; interactive whiteboard; download inquiry
6. platform navigation; group files; user support; resource access
7. image sharing; designer communication
8. update announcement; component change; dry batteries; simulation; internal resistance
9. component introduction; student power supply; dc and ac support; ideal component

Summary: The conversation begins with a user requesting a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and vibrations, which is acknowledged by the designer. The designer then shares their development priorities, including completing the electrical section and magnetism before moving on to other parts. The user expresses gratitude, and another user inquires about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab. The designer shares an image, announces an update that will change the simulation of dry batteries, and introduces the student power supply component.

Notes: The conversation highlights the collaborative nature of the Physics Lab online community, where users provide feedback and request features, and designers respond and prioritize development. The platform's navigation and resource access are also explored. I hypothesize that the community's participatory design approach will continue to shape the platform's development and feature prioritization.

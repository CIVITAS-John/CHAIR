You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
Preliminary tags: sharing educational level
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
Preliminary tags: technical discussion
3. P2: @Designer 
Preliminary tags: mentioning designer
4. P17: [Image 198]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
Preliminary tags: chemistry knowledge
6. P2: +1
Preliminary tags: agreement
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken.
8. P14: [Image 202]
9. P14: What do you mean?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top. 233333
11. P14: The condensed liquid won't flow back, right?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh, I see.
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year.
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be about electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay.
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
32. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.

1.
Label: considers ai a time saving resource
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

2.
Label: reflects on the importance of resetting parameters
Quotes:
- E04: So one thing I'm realizing now, part of my setup needs to be reset all. (interviewer's observation) E04 sees from the generated code and realizes that he needs to reset.

3.
Label: queries ai for missing code structures
Quotes:
- E04: "how to define breeds in netlogo" (interviewer's observation) E04 tries to find certain syntax structures from the AI-generated code and ask for it when it is not there.

4.
Label: seeks seamless interaction with ai
Quotes:
- E04: I really liked how, like the code that it generates, if you could just kind of place that into the model automatically.  (interviewer's observation) The capability to put into the model automatically.

5.
Label: reflect on cultural barriers to collaboration
Quotes:
- E01: What you have in America is this, this cult of individualism to a point of obsession. And people don't naturally stop and go, how can I get help with this? (interviewer's observation) Continued: reflection on the individualism.

6.
Label: regularly evaluates ai
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

7.
Label: describes iterative error fixing
Quotes:
- E01: I have I found with with playing with with ChatGPT. And I was something at Python, I think I tried to give it the code. And I tried to run it generated error. And then I would go back to the next prompt and ChatGPT. And I go, that code is good. But it generates the following error. And I list the error online on this line, and I'd quote the line. And I say, Can you fix that?  (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug in the generated code, he refers to his previous practice with asking ChatGPT to debug with the code, the error message, and the line number. Interviewer did what E01 said.

8.
Label: sees ai as a coding assistant
Quotes:
- E01: So if I'm writing long NetLogo code now, I'd probably have ChatGPT just open on the side. And I write a block of code and then I handed ChatGPT. Say, could I have done this better? And it would go, yeah, you could rearrange this like that. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could help E01 optimize his code.

9.
Label: compares ai to unreliable mapping services
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

13.
Label: reflects on learning process
Quotes:
- E01: This is what conversations with ChatGPT typically look like. I had to go through about eight separate times to get all the errors out of it.  But, but look at how it structured the code. Look at the things that did look what you could learn from this. This is valuable. (interviewer's observation) Users may benefit from the iterative debugging process during working with AI, even though AI might give wrong answers.
- E01: And, and they don't, this is an unfamiliar task to them apparently. So they want to ask one question and get the right answer the first time. And I, I don't have that expectation. I'll ask the right question and it'll get me 80% of the way there. (interviewer's observation) Novices might have a too high expectation for ChatGPT (but it cannot achieve that).
- E01: Part of this, the user needs a little practice in debugging their own code. There should be some exercises before you ask GPT to do this.  (interviewer's observation) Users need practice in debugging their own code and need to have exercises before asking AI.
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 laughs when he sees ChatGPT making a classical error.

14.
Label: uses ai for debugging
Quotes:

16.
Label: emphasize need for clearer communication
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.
- E01: if you approach the user group politely, graciously, and instead of dropping your entire code on it, you go, I narrowed it down to this. I read this documentation. I tried these eight things with this answer and I'm perplexed. If somebody goes, they paste their problem and it's clearly their homework and they want someone else to do it for them. No, I'm not going to help with that. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on proper practices to seek online help: do your own work and clearly describe what you need/tried.
- E01: In terms of learning experiences, like ramping up to using an assistant wrapping up to using ChatGPT might have some sort of evaluates. How well can you write instructions for another person? Some people just don't know how to conceptualize a problem. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how "writing instructions" is a capability that is missing on many people, and that is key to work with AI.

17.
Label: selectively copies code to enhance his model
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) Again, he reads the code and selectively copies code to the model.

18.
Label: emphasizes the importance of natural language
Quotes:
- E01: I speak to (ChatGPT) like a person. I could just walk in the room and go write me code that does X, but I don't, I start with good morning. And it comes back, but it comes back with good morning. How can I assist you today? It's pretty good at figuring out natural language. So in some sense that you might just be better off, just pretend it's not a computer. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how he interacts with ChatGPT like a person.

19.
Label: notes time saving documentation search
Quotes:
- E04: And it could take a lot of time to like search the documentation and go online and try and figure out all those answers and just to have it like right there. So you can kind of stay within the task is really nice. (interviewer's observation) The capability to search for documentation and read it inside the workspace: esp. beneficial for novices.

20.
Label: notes common pitfalls
Quotes:
- E01: I mean, it's like, write a line of code. Are there any errors? But, beginners will start and they write three pages of code and then they hit the green check mark.  (interviewer's observation) Beginners could write chunks of code and then find many errors that they cannot fix.

21.
Label: express desire for more knowledge
Quotes:
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time.

22.
Label: values ai's assistance in model creation
Quotes:
- E04: I use it a lot for developing like, equations for specific like, aspects of agent-based models that I create. (interviewer's observation) Helpful for creating equations

Label: evaluates options
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 reads error messages before making a choice.

24.
Label: emphasizes the challenges of returning to projects
Quotes:
- E01: Depending on what you do and how busy you are and the higher ranking people are, the more busy they are, the longer it is between sessions. So you make some notes on little yellow, sticky cinnamon. And then you go back to your administrator job for two months, and then some other project comes up. And then six months later, you come back. Okay, now, where was I? (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on how professionals learn - they learn in fragments, in fragmented time blocks and need support from the system to remind them where they were.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: theoretically, it should be compatible
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

2.
Label: praising the software as practical and user friendly
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

3.
Label: mention feedback based prompts
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

4.
Label: exploring software adaptability
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

5.
Label: agree to implement suggestion
Quotes:

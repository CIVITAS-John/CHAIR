You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: confirming teacher identity
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

2.
Label: user suggestion
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

3.
Label: explain current version's limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

4.
Label: provide conditional advice
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

5.
Label: set user expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

6.
Label: address functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

7.

8.
Label: indicate potential user needs
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

9.
Label: outline development priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

10.
Label: design principles
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

11.
Label: feature simplification
Quotes:
- Designer: Make it simpler...

12.
Label: design suggestion
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

13.
Label: share development plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

14.
Label: appreciate dedication
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

15.
Label: version update notes
Quotes:
- Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
More realistic 3D appearance for various meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeter and meter zeroing.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments

Label: simplification and refinement in design
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- Designer: Make it simpler...

17.
Label: future design plans/considerations
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

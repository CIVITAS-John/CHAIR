You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between sub-codes. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (1 in total):

1. elicit feedback, community suggestions.
- Requesting feedback or suggestions from the community.
- Posts that propose or discuss ideas for improvement or change.

Here is the output:

Categories: 
* Community Engagement
* Participatory Design

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1.
Relationship: Parallel sub-codes, both related to community involvement.
Criteria: Posts or actions that involve the community in decision-making or improvement processes.
Label: Community Involvement
Category: Community Engagement

Note: I merged the two sub-codes as they both relate to involving the community in the decision-making process, either through feedback or suggestions. The category "Community Engagement" fits well with the theoretical lens of participatory design.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with interpretation phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with phrases. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary phrases: for example; see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram; or vice versa; designer 1 reiterates the bidirectional conversion; reinforcing the software's capabilities
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary phrases: don't aim for completeness; it should be categorized and refined one by one; user 4232 advises a gradual; incremental approach; recognizing the complexity of the development process
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary phrases: hmm; designer 1 responds thoughtfully; considering user feedback and suggestions
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

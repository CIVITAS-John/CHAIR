You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: highlight practical use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

10.
Label: appreciation of features
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

11.
Label: personalize user support
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

12.
Label: acknowledge user input
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.

13.
Label: list upcoming features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

14.
Label: provide personal background
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

15.
Label: reiterate bidirectional conversion
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

16.
Label: indirect reject
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

17.
Label: address user concerns
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

18.
Label: detail educational utility
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

19.
Label: set timeline for electromagnetism
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

20.
Label: followup on gradelevel
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

Label: acknowledge potential issue
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

22.
Label: express software improvement needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers.

Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

32.
Label: outline future possibilities
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

2.
Label: suggesting the current design may not be optimized for expert users
Quotes:
- E04: Part of the issue that I'm having now is just kind of like the learning curve, just trying to figure out how everything works. (interviewer's observation) E04 mentions a learning curve, likely because our current design is not fine-tuned for experts.

3.
Label: values iterative approach
Quotes:
- E01: I've observed when I tried to suggest ChatGPT to other people, they're, um, they are amazed at the output that I can get. And that's because I know how to ask six questions in a row to zero in on what I'm after. (interviewer's observation) To maximize the capability of ChatGPT, one needs to know how to iteratively ask questions.

4.
Label: discouraging reliance on others for homework
Quotes:
- E01: if you approach the user group politely, graciously, and instead of dropping your entire code on it, you go, I narrowed it down to this. I read this documentation. I tried these eight things with this answer and I'm perplexed. If somebody goes, they paste their problem and it's clearly their homework and they want someone else to do it for them. No, I'm not going to help with that. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on proper practices to seek online help: do your own work and clearly describe what you need/tried.

5.
Label: expresses amusement
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 laughs when he sees ChatGPT making a classical error.

6.
Label: seeks human assistance but due to time constraint  rely on instant feedback
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

7.
Label: expert users like e04 tend to use ai as a complementary tool rather than a primary resource
Quotes:
- E04: I've found that AI is really helpful for like, translating other models from other languages into NetLogo, for example. (interviewer's observation) Helpful for translating from other languages into NetLogo

8.
Label: hive feedback system - collect information to minimize miscommunication
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

9.
Label: suggesting that ai could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.

13.
Label: holding unrealistic expectations of ai capabilities
Quotes:
- E01: And, and they don't, this is an unfamiliar task to them apparently. So they want to ask one question and get the right answer the first time. And I, I don't have that expectation. I'll ask the right question and it'll get me 80% of the way there. (interviewer's observation) Novices might have a too high expectation for ChatGPT (but it cannot achieve that).

18.
Label: asks ai to implement ideas
Quotes:
- E04: "Can train-perceptron be turned into a reporter" (interviewer's observation) E04 uses "can you fix with my own idea".

19.
Label: human-effort: self-evaluation
Quotes:
- E04: maybe you saw something that I didn't, but from my perspective, it seemed as though the code was set up appropriately, but it was marking the syntax as wrong. So maybe I was missing something, but I didn't see anything missing. So that was kind of frustrating. (interviewer's observation) Shows error messages even when it seems to be correct (that's a bug identified)
- E04: It seems like a bug because I feel like all my parentheses are closed and all of my arguments and syntax are correct. (interviewer's observation) A less-clear error message makes E04 stuck.

And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

21.
Label: defining a task for chat gpt
Quotes:
- E01: So let's say "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square." (interviewer's observation) E01's first task.
- E04: "I want to create a simple feed-forward neural network in NetLogo with one hidden layer."

22.
Label: drawing parallels to early navigation systems
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

23.
Label: reevaluating work processes
Quotes:
- E01: But if a tool can do your, can do most of your work in five minutes, why would you spend two weeks? ... I would never hire someone who spent two weeks solving a problem that they could do in five minutes. (interviewer's observation) AI might be able to save people's time.

24.
Label: e04 appreciates in task documentation accessibility
Quotes:
- E04: And it could take a lot of time to like search the documentation and go online and try and figure out all those answers and just to have it like right there. So you can kind of stay within the task is really nice. (interviewer's observation) The capability to search for documentation and read it inside the workspace: esp. beneficial for novices.

25.
Label: not just syntax errors
Quotes:
- E01: So I see this from beginners all the time is they, they just get totally lost. I call it lint program from Unix, you know, it's like it's a little green checkbox looks at you and go, okay, wait, it's just, you've spelled everything correctly, but you have a conceptual error here. If it, if it caught structural problems like that, that would, that would help. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo needs to have linting features that exist in other languages (we are working on that right now). Here, E01 wants the linting to support identifying conceptual mistakes, different from syntax mistakes which most linters work on.

26.
Label: ai ability (positive)
Quotes:
- E01: But if a tool can do your, can do most of your work in five minutes, why would you spend two weeks? ... I would never hire someone who spent two weeks solving a problem that they could do in five minutes. (interviewer's observation) AI might be able to save people's time.

29.
Label: critiquing existing technical documentation and imagining ai improvements
Quotes:
- E01: I cannot learn like that. I'm sorry. I am not a top left first page to last page. So if AI can help find a good place to start and manage that learning process, then I think that's astounding. (interviewer's observation) Critique on the existing situation of technical documentation and imagine that AI could improve the learning process.

30.
Label: preferring to engage actively with the learning process

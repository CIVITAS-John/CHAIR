You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---

~~~
1. designer responsiveness, designer's openness to feedback.
- The designer's responsiveness to the teacher's needs and suggestions.
- The designer's openness to suggestions and feedback from the community.

2. user involvement, user engagement.
- The extent to which users are involved in the design and development process.
- The level of active participation and interest shown by the group members in the development and use of the software.

3. community participation, community engagement and participation.
- The community members' active involvement in the development process, such as providing feedback and requesting features.
- The extent to which the software designer actively involves the user community in the development process, seeks their input and feedback, and responds to their needs. This includes mechanisms within the software that enable community members to provide feedback, as well as the community's level of engagement and participation.

4. group sharing, content sharing.
- Statements about sharing information within the group.
- The technical aspects of uploading and sharing content within the online community.

5. learning support, instructional support.
- Discussions that address the software's ability to support learning and educational activities.
- The support and guidance provided by the designer to help users understand and use the software effectively, including scaffolding and other instructional features.

6. teaching experience, learning experience.
- Statements about the teaching experience of group members.
- Features and mechanisms within the software that enable students to actively engage in hands-on experiments, explore physics concepts, and receive feedback on their understanding and actions.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. 
Concepts: provide development updates, share update previews and research efforts
Relationship: The concepts are interrelated as both involve communication from designers regarding the current and future state of the Physics Lab software, focusing on updates and research.
Criteria: Designers communicated the current status and future plans of the Physics Lab software by sharing updates and detailed information about ongoing research efforts.
Phrase: Communicate software development updates.

2. 
Concepts: prioritization, plan project development
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as prioritization directly informs the planning of project development, indicating a structured approach to feature implementation.
Criteria: Designers established the order of feature development and priorities for future software projects by outlining task prioritization.
Phrase: Outline project development priorities.

3. 
Concepts: product gap, voice technical concerns
Relationship: The concepts are related as users identify deficiencies in the software and articulate their technical concerns, indicating a need for improvements.
Criteria: Users identified gaps in existing software capabilities and expressed technical concerns to advocate for enhancements that would improve usability.
Phrase: Advocate for software improvements.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. P13: From freshman year in high school.
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image 198]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used with test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 202]
9. P14: How do you say?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Will the condensed liquid not flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year...
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be on electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
32. P1: If you can create a comprehensive and free software, it should be very popular.
33. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's game over.
34. P11: If you include all these, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
35. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
36. P11: Hey, good idea
37. P2: Hehe
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
39. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
40. Designer: The question is
41. Designer: Where does the light come from?
42. P11: What about light?
43. Designer: Are you shining a light bulb on a photosensitive resistor?
44. P2: Touch by hand
45. P14: I think there's no problem
46. Designer: Then it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
47. P2: With Xiaodeng
48. Designer: Microtransactions...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 245]
52. Designer: Let's talk about it later
53. Designer: Can watch ads even without money
54. Designer: The practice of a conscience game
55. P1: Put up ads
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: It doesn't conduct electricity when you touch it
58. Designer: Oh
59. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (...)
60. P11: ðŸ˜‚
61. P11: Just wanted to say
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but I simply don't know how to top up
63. P11: Can also adapt to 3D Touch
64. Designer: Can you top up directly on the app store?
65. P14: Seems a bit troublesome
66. P2: â€¦â€¦
67. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now
68. P14: After all, just a middle school student
69. Designer: That's true
70. Designer: Then let's watch ads hh
71. P14: Yes, we can
72. P2: What's up with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
73. P2: A middle schooler is even better than you
74. P11: Just hope that ads won't take up too much of the interface
75. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
76. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method
77. P2: Oh.
78. P2: ï½ž
79. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
80. Designer: Just asking you to watch ads for points, use points to unlock new content like this
81. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come hit me along the Ethernet cable
82. P2: I can code
83. P11: Okay!
84. P2: [Emoji 280]
85. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is too disgusting
86. P2: Indeed
87. Designer: The screen is not big, but it's still impressive.
88. P2: It even forces you to click.
89. P2: What's the purpose of the ads for you guys?
90. Designer: Health preservation...
91. Designer: Doing this requires nurturing people...
92. P1: It's free.
93. Designer: In fact, it's the same as receiving money, just that you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay.
94. P2: Oh.
95. Designer: Do more of it.
96. Designer: There are some other ways as well.
97. P8: The points wall is okay.
98. P8: I think it's okay.
99. P14: I also think it's okay.
100. Designer: Actually, you can learn from that mini-program.
101. Designer: Creating questions, reviewing questions, and answering questions.
102. P14: æ€Žä¹ˆè¯´ï¼Ÿ
103. P14: [Image 299]
104. P17: Brainiac.
105. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
106. P18: Just downloaded it.
107. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10

* Summary
The conversation in Physics Lab's online message group revolves around discussions related to physics, chemistry, and software development. Participants discuss topics such as using test tubes, superconductors, light-sensitive components, and the integration of ads in software. The conversation also delves into the challenges of simulating chemistry experiments and the implications of software design on user experience.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the perspective of learning sciences, one could look at how participants engage with and learn from each other's knowledge and experiences in physics and chemistry. From a human-computer interaction standpoint, one could examine how users interact with software features like light-sensitive components and ads. Finally, through the lens of participatory design, one could explore how participants contribute to shaping the online community and the development of software tools for educational purposes.

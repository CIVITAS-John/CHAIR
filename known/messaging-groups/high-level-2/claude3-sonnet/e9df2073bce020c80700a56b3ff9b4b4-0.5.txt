1. P13: From freshman year in high school.
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image 198]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used with test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 202]
9. P14: How do you say?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Will the condensed liquid not flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year...
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be on electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
32. P1: If you can create a comprehensive and free software, it should be very popular.
33. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's game over.
34. P11: If you include all these, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
35. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
36. P11: Hey, good idea
37. P2: Hehe
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
39. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
40. Designer: The question is
41. Designer: Where does the light come from?
42. P11: What about light?
43. Designer: Are you shining a light bulb on a photosensitive resistor?
44. P2: Touch by hand
45. P14: I think there's no problem
46. Designer: Then it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
47. P2: With Xiaodeng
48. Designer: Microtransactions...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 245]
52. Designer: Let's talk about it later
53. Designer: Can watch ads even without money
54. Designer: The practice of a conscience game
55. P1: Put up ads
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: It doesn't conduct electricity when you touch it
58. Designer: Oh
59. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (...)
60. P11: ðŸ˜‚
61. P11: Just wanted to say
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but I simply don't know how to top up
63. P11: Can also adapt to 3D Touch
64. Designer: Can you top up directly on the app store?
65. P14: Seems a bit troublesome
66. P2: â€¦â€¦
67. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now
68. P14: After all, just a middle school student
69. Designer: That's true
70. Designer: Then let's watch ads hh
71. P14: Yes, we can
72. P2: What's up with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
73. P2: A middle schooler is even better than you
74. P11: Just hope that ads won't take up too much of the interface
75. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
76. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method
77. P2: Oh.
78. P2: ï½ž
79. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
80. Designer: Just asking you to watch ads for points, use points to unlock new content like this
81. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come hit me along the Ethernet cable
82. P2: I can code
83. P11: Okay!
84. P2: [Emoji 280]
85. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is too disgusting
86. P2: Indeed
87. Designer: The screen is not big, but it's still impressive.
88. P2: It even forces you to click.
89. P2: What's the purpose of the ads for you guys?
90. Designer: Health preservation...
91. Designer: Doing this requires nurturing people...
92. P1: It's free.
93. Designer: In fact, it's the same as receiving money, just that you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay.
94. P2: Oh.
95. Designer: Do more of it.
96. Designer: There are some other ways as well.
97. P8: The points wall is okay.
98. P8: I think it's okay.
99. P14: I also think it's okay.
100. Designer: Actually, you can learn from that mini-program.
101. Designer: Creating questions, reviewing questions, and answering questions.
102. P14: æ€Žä¹ˆè¯´ï¼Ÿ
103. P14: [Image 299]
104. P17: Brainiac.
105. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
106. P18: Just downloaded it.
107. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10

*Summary*

The conversation revolves around discussions related to designing an educational physics simulation software called "Physics Lab". The participants discuss various aspects such as incorporating chemistry experiments, light-sensitive components, payment models (ads, in-app purchases), and user experience considerations. The conversation also touches upon topics like computational power requirements, realistic simulations, and potential features like 3D Touch support.

*Plan*

To analyze this conversation from the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Learning Sciences: Identify discussions around pedagogical approaches, learning objectives, and how the software aims to facilitate learning physics concepts.
2. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): Examine the conversations related to user interface design, user experience, and interaction modalities (e.g., touch, gestures).
3. Participatory Design: Look for instances where participants contribute ideas, provide feedback, or engage in collaborative decision-making processes.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: gives reason for it
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

2.
Label: using images to help demonstration
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

3.
Label: give reason
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

4.
Label: validate designer's direction
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

5.
Label: expressing frustration with current avatar limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

6.
Label: answer a concern
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

7.
Label: praises software's simulation effect in class
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

8.
Label: acknowledging the spirit of craftsmanship and striving for perfection
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

9.
Label: appreciation of features
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

10.
Label: manage expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

11.
Label: reflect community values
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

17.
Label: offer another reason to the developer's question
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

18.
Label: ask a question
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]

- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

23.
Label: considered broader implications
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

24.
Label: indicating responsiveness to user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

25.
Label: clarified previous response
Quotes:
- User: Left side

26.

- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

30.
Label: expand platform scope
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

31.
Label: inferred user need

1. P14: I can't remember if it's 78 or 79.
2. P14: [Image]
3. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
4. P11: Look it up online, this is not something that can be solved in a few words. @P2 
5. P2: Can we add a motor? @Designer 
6. P14: I think I should focus on doing mathematics.
7. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
8. Designer: We will be relatively simple, practical (close to the exam), and affordable.
9. P11: 2333
10. P11: Ask the group owner.
11. Designer: After all, it's not specifically about astronomy.
12. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
13. P2: [Image]
14. P2: From what I know currently.
15. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in the Physics Lab?
16. Designer: Motor simulation is more complicated, and it depends on the load.
17. Designer: Calculated it...
18. P2: How was it calculated?
19. P11: Okay.
20. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
21. P11: [Image]
22. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but an atomized model.
23. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
24. P1: Server?
25. P11: Hahaha
26. Designer: Standalone.
27. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
28. Designer: Two types of motors.
29. P1: Are you going to the server?
30. P2: Brushed motor.

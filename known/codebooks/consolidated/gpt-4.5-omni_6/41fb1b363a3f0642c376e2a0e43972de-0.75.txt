You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (64 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

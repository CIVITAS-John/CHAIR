You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: outline planned features; emphasize educational value; enhance experimental detail
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: express enthusiasm; validate designer's ideas; encourage further development
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: commit to community consultation; emphasize participatory design; enhance user involvement
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: seek input from educators; promote collaboration; ensure relevance to educational materials
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: confirm understanding; validate community knowledge; foster collaborative decision making
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: agree on common terminology; establish shared understanding; enhance community coherence
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation reflects a collaborative effort between designers and users in the development of the Physics Lab platform. Designers outline features aimed at enhancing educational value and seek input from users, particularly educators, to ensure relevance and usability. Users express enthusiasm and provide feedback, which the designers acknowledge and incorporate into their decision-making process. The dialogue emphasizes participatory design, community engagement, and the importance of clear communication, while also addressing technical aspects of the platform.

Notes: This conversation highlights the emergence of a supportive online community where users feel valued and engaged in the design process. The designers' commitment to consultation and feedback is crucial for fostering a sense of ownership among users. Future analyses could explore how this collaborative environment influences user satisfaction and learning outcomes within the Physics Lab. Additionally, examining the role of educators in shaping content could provide further insights into the platform's educational effectiveness.

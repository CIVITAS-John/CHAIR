You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: highlights problem solving capabilities within the application
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

2.
Label: discussed long term benefits
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

3.

Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

4.
Label: describe update scope
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

5.
Label: updates on upcoming features and components
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

6.
Label: design question
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

7.

Quotes:
- User: Oh, this is nice
- User: ok

8.
Label: acknowledging community expertise
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- Designer: We are working on this part

9.
Label: demonstrating domain expertise
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

10.
Label: committing to participatory design
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

11.
Label: gathering feedback

12.
Label: provide future plans
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

13.
Label: engaged community
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
- Designer: We are working on this part

14.
Label: designer 1 informs about component changes

- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

15.
Label: explaining the decision to release the pc version first while waiting for apple store review
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

16.

22.
Label: explain limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

23.

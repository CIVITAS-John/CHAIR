Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

42. Designer: It depends on the scale.
43. P2: Who said that?
44. P4: universe sandbox
45. Designer: There will be multiple presets.
46. Designer: Because in reality, you encounter various possibilities, and many questions are about near-Earth space stations.

48. Designer: Artificial satellite orbits.
49. Designer: These will be more involved.
50. Designer: Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter this often...

61. P14: [Image 133]
62. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
63. P11: Check it out online, this can't be explained in a few words. @P2 
64. P2: Can a motor be added? @Designer 
65. P14: I think I should stick to doing math.
66. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
67. Designer: Ours will be simpler, more practical (closer to exams), and cheaper.
68. P11: üòÇ
69. P11: Hmm, ask the group owner.
70. Designer: After all, it's not specifically for astronomy.
71. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
72. P2: [Image 144]
73. P2: As far as I know.
74. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in Physics Lab?
75. Designer: Motor simulation is quite complicated and related to the load.
76. Designer: Calculated...
77. P2: How is it calculated?
78. P11: Okay.
79. P11: Because of that rectifier last time, I naively thought it was a preset model.
80. P11: [Image 152]
81. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but it's an atomized model.
82. Designer: Pursuing precision, a phone can't handle the calculations.
83. P1: Server?
84. P11: Hahaha.
85. Designer: Standalone.
86. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
87. Designer: Two types of motors.
88. P1: Are you on the server?
89. P2: There are brush motors.
90. P2: Not brushless motors connected to AC power.
91. P14: Finally talking about something I can understand
92. P2: You don't understand brushless motors
93. P2: It's hard to make it work
94. P4: Making a motor is quite simple if you follow my method @Designer 
95. P14: [Image 168]
96. P2: What if it burns out?
97. P4: Just power it up and play a rotating animation, that's it üòÇ
98. P2: Do you still need an algorithm?
99. P4: üòÇ Simple and done
100. P2: Algorithms are not simple
101. P2: igdt can also be added @Designer 
102. P13: [Image 175]
103. P13: Are you all fake?
104. P13: Are you from outer space?
105. P13: I don't understand
106. P2: Transistors can also be used
107. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do that in a normal experiment...
108. P11: üòÇ That's in electronic circuits
109. P11: I don't understand either
110. P2: In the CPU
111. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned a bit when I took an elective course on circuits
112. P2: Add a polarized capacitor
113. P2: I learned it all by myself
114. P11: That's great, if you have a passion for it
115. P14: @P11 Do they still separate arts and science tracks now?
116. P2: no
117. P11: We don't separate arts and science tracks anymore
118. P14: [Image 191]
119. P14: ...let me get admitted first and then we'll talk
120. P2: I'm still in 2nd year of middle school
121. P11: Keep it up
122. P13: First year of high school
123. P2: What about MOSFETs?
124. P2: @Designer 
125. P17: [Image 198]
126. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
127. P2: +1

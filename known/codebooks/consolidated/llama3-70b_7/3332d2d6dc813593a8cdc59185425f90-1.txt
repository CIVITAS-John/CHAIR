You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

- Users express frustration with unclear error messages.
- Users find explanation options insufficient and note incomplete AI responses.

2.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1.
Concepts: encounters ai limitations, finding incomplete responses
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as users' encounters with AI limitations lead to their experiences of finding incomplete responses.
Criteria: Participants experience frustration when AI-driven interfaces provide unclear error messages or insufficient explanations, resulting in incomplete responses.
Phrase: Detects AI limitations and incomplete responses.

2.
Concepts: acknowledge ai limitations and value
Relationship: The concepts are complementary, as acknowledging AI limitations is paired with recognizing its value.
Criteria: Users recognize the limitations of LLM-driven interfaces and AI input capabilities while appreciating their usefulness in providing solutions.
Phrase: Balances AI limitations with perceived value.

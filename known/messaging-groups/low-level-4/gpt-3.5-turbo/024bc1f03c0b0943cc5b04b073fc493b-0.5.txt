You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: outlining plans for creating a simulated experiment assessment function for electricity; with detailed features like zero adjustment
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: user expressing enthusiasm and approval for the proposed idea
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: planning to consult with the community before implementing new features
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Preliminary phrases: seeking input from teachers in the group regarding the types of circuit diagrams used in current textbooks
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: sharing an image reference related to circuit diagrams
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: user confirming the prevalent use of a specific style in circuit diagrams
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

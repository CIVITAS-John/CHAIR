You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

# Reflection
Can you identify more categories for merging?
Yes, the current categories can be further merged. The "software development and updates" and "technical support" categories are relatively small and can be merged into the broader "Community Engagement and Development" category.

Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
The current merging plan does not have any over-merged categories that need to be split. The two resulting categories, "Community Engagement and Development" and "Technical Support", cover the key aspects of the research question.

Is any naming inaccurate?
The naming of the categories is accurate and concisely covers the aspects of the research question.

# Final Merging
* community engagement and collaboration
* software development and updates
* technical support
=> Community Engagement and Development

=> Technical Support

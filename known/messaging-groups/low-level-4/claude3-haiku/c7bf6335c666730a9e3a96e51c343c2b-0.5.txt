You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: requesting specific features related to mechanical waves; vibrations; and optical experiments
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: explaining the development prioritization plan; focusing on electrical; magnetism; and then other sections
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: indicating the need to gather more opinions before starting the mechanics section
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: expressing gratitude for the development work
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: asking about the download location for the pc/interactive whiteboard version of physics lab
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: acknowledging finding the group files with the download information
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: The conversation seems to revolve around the development and features of the Physics Lab application. The first user is requesting specific features related to mechanical waves, vibrations, and optical experiments. The designers respond by explaining their development prioritization plan, focusing first on electrical and magnetism sections, and then gathering more opinions before starting the mechanics section. There are also discussions about the availability of the PC/interactive whiteboard version and the changes in the power supply components. To analyze this conversation, I will draw on theories from learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to understand the community's emergence, the designers' decision-making process, and the user's needs and preferences.

Interpretations for each message:
1. Requesting the addition of dynamic demonstrations for mechanical waves, vibrations, and optical experiments; expressing a desire for specific features related to wave propagation, superposition, diffraction, and interference, as well as optical benches, slits, and polarizers.
2. Explaining the development prioritization plan, focusing first on completing the electrical section, then magnetism, and then other sections.
3. Indicating the need to gather more opinions from the community before starting the mechanics section, to ensure that all important features are included.
4. Expressing gratitude for the development work being done.
5. Asking about the download location for the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab.
6. Acknowledging that the user has found the group files containing the download information.
7. Sharing an image, possibly related to the development or features of Physics Lab.
8. Announcing that dry batteries will no longer be ideal components, and that the internal resistance can be removed to simulate them.
9. Informing the community that the student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Summary: The conversation reveals the emergence of the Physics Lab online community, where users are actively providing feedback and requests for specific features, and the designers are responding by explaining their development priorities and plans, as well as making changes to the application based on user input. The designers seem to be taking a participatory approach, gathering opinions from the community before finalizing certain sections, and are also addressing user needs related to the availability of the PC/interactive whiteboard version and the power supply components.

Notes: The designers appear to be following a systematic approach to the development of Physics Lab, prioritizing certain sections over others. They are also demonstrating a willingness to incorporate user feedback and adapt the application accordingly. The community seems engaged and interested in the development process, suggesting a collaborative and participatory dynamic. It will be interesting to see how the designers continue to navigate the community's needs and preferences as the development progresses.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (13 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...
...
13. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary codes: research announcement; bidirectional conversion
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary codes: advice on development; categorization
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary codes: acknowledgement
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

Thoughts: For this first round of coding, I will focus on identifying the key concepts, actors, and intentions in the conversation. I will analyze the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will look for codes that relate to the research question, "How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?" I will also consider the designers' and users' roles, their interactions, and the development of Physics Lab.

Codes for each message:
1. Designer-1: research announcement; bidirectional conversion; circuit diagram connection
2. User-4232: development advice; categorization; iterative refinement
3. Designer-1: acknowledgement; minimal response
4. Designer-1: physics focus areas; limitations; future development plans
5. User-4232: agreement; acknowledgement
6. Designer-1: personal interest; chemistry interest
7. Designer-1: future development possibility; opportunity-based development
8. Designer-1: simulated experiment assessment; experimental details; functionality planning
9. User-4232: positive feedback; idea endorsement
10. Designer-1: community engagement; collective decision-making
11. Designer-1: expert consultation; textbook analysis; circuit diagram types
12. Designer-1: image sharing; circuit diagram example
13. User-4234: confirmation; common practice identification

Summary: The conversation starts with the designer announcing the connection between circuit diagrams and physical diagrams. A user provides advice on development, suggesting categorization and refinement. The designer shares their focus on electricity and mechanics, with potential future development in other areas. The conversation then shifts to the designer's personal interest in chemistry and plans for simulated experiment assessment. The user provides positive feedback, and the designer discusses community engagement and expert consultation.

Notes: The conversation suggests that the designers are actively engaging with the community, seeking feedback and advice. The focus on physics and electricity indicates a clear direction for the development of Physics Lab. The designers' personal interests and future development plans are also revealed, which may influence the direction of the online community. The use of images and expert consultation implies a participatory design approach.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

6.
Label: design thoughts
Quotes:
- Designer: Make it simpler...

7.
Label: confirm the diagnose
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

8.
Label: self rebut the previous response
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

9.
Label: explaning technical artifacts
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

10.
Label: gives an answer
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- Designer: Group sharing.

11.
Label: asking for update
Quotes:
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

12.

13.
Label: concurring on design ideas
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

14.
Label: raise a concern for the new feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

15.
Label: greeting back
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

16.
Label: context
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

17.
Label: give rationale to development decision
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

18.
Label: access
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

23.
Label: clarification question
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

24.
Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

25.
Label: propose another feature
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

26.
Label: asking follow-up questions on needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

27.
Label: vague on responses to the feature request
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

28.
Label: communication about progress and plans

- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

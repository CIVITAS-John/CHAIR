You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

17.
Label: designer 1 sets timeline for update
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

19.
Label: set timeline for update
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

20.
Label: followup

- User: Win7 should be fine.

21.
Label: compare user experiences
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

22.
Label: humanize the designer's role
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]
- User: Oh, this is nice

28.
Label: articulate detailed needs for physics demonstrations
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

29.
Label: contribute to collaborative atmosphere
Quotes:
- User: Indeed

30.
Label: clarified platform requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

31.

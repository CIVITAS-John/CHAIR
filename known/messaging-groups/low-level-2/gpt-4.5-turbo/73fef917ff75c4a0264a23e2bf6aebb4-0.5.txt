You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken.
8. P14: [Image]
9. P14: What do you mean?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top. 233333
11. P14: The condensed liquid won't flow back, right?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh, I see.
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year.
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be about electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay.
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?

Thoughts: To analyze the conversation, I will focus on identifying tags related to the nature of each message, such as question, answer, clarification, humor, agreement, and reference to academic content. This will help in understanding the dynamics of social interactions within the Physics Lab's online community and how members engage with each other around academic and non-academic topics.

Summary: The conversation in the Physics Lab's online messaging group revolves around a mix of academic discussions, personal introductions, and light-hearted exchanges. Participants engage in technical inquiries, share resources, seek clarifications, and express agreements predominantly through non-verbal cues (+1, "Oh"). The interactions also reflect a blend of humor and serious discussion, suggesting a community that is comfortable with both rigorous academic topics and more relaxed, informal communication.

Notes: The community shows a healthy mix of engagement styles, from serious technical discussions about chemistry and physics to more casual interactions. The use of humor and informal language alongside academic discussions indicates a supportive and inclusive environment. This analysis helps in understanding how the community balances academic rigor with a friendly atmosphere, which could be crucial in fostering a sense of belonging and active participation among members.

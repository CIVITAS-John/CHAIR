You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: suggest educational enhancements
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

2.
Label: future design plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

3.
Label: plans sequential content development
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

4.
Label: promoting understanding of ideal components
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

5.
Label: outlining technical possibilities
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

6.
Label: explaining the purpose of the current circuit diagram version and the limitations of the auto layout algorithm
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

7.
Label: inquiring about user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

8.
Label: expresses gratitude for the community's support and pledges improvement
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

9.
Label: considering broader implications
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

10.
Label: provide practical advice
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

11.
Label: user 4238 confirms update
Quotes:
- User: Updated

12.
Label: acknowledging the optimization efforts
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

13.
Label: demonstrating interest in multiple platforms
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

14.
Label: expresses hopes for convenient circuit diagram drawing and teacher friendly features
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

15.
Label: considering user context
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

16.
Label: self-help
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

17.
Label: encourage future discussion or questions
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

18.
Label: highlighting update contents
Quotes:
- Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features

Label: clarifying design constraints
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

20.
Label: give more information about the version uploaded
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

21.
Label: highlighting challenges
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

22.
Label: promoting bidirectional conversion

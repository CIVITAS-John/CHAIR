You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation delves into technical aspects, such as the incorporation of light-sensitive components and pressure-sensitive resistors, along with considerations for monetization through ads and fees. Participants engage in humorous exchanges and suggest practical enhancements to the Physics Lab platform, while also discussing challenges related to payment methods and additional features like 3D Touch functionality.
1. P2: What about superconductors?
Preliminary tags: inquiry about superconductors
2. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
Preliminary tags: complexity of simulating chemistry experiments
3. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
Preliminary tags: potential popularity of comprehensive software creation
4. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
5. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
6. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
7. P11: Hey, good idea.
8. P2: Hehe.
9. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
10. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
11. Designer: The question is,
12. Designer: Where does the light come from?
13. P11: What about light?
14. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
15. P2: Touch it with your hand.
16. P14: I think there's no problem.
17. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
18. P2: And a small light.
19. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
20. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
21. P2: ï¼Ÿ
22. P14: [Image 245]
23. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
24. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
25. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
26. P1: Let's put up some ads.
27. Designer: Hmm.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label: A label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...

1. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
2. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
3. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
4. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
5. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
6. Designer-1: The update is quite large...
7. User-4236: [Emoji 2-107]
8. User-4234: [Emoji 2-108]
9. Designer-1: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
10. Designer-1: Although you can manually adjust the layout
11. Designer-1: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
12. User-4234: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”
13. Designer-1: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
14. Designer-1: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first
15. Designer-1: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
More realistic 3D appearance for various meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeter and meter zeroing.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments
Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal/realistic modes.

# Special Tips
The Esc shortcut key will now minimize the window.
The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.
16. User-4237: [Emoji 2-116]
17. Designer-1: The new version has already been sent in the group
18. Designer-1: iOS is waiting for review~
19. User-4237: [Emoji 2-119]
20. User-4237: ok
21. User-4232: [Emoji 2-121]
22. Designer-1: The one in the group is the PC version
23. Designer-1: The Android version is expected to update tonight
24. Designer-1: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch
25. User-4238: Has the Android version not been updated yet?
26. User-4238: Updated

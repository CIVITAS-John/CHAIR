Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

* Summary
The conversation in the Physics Lab's online message group involves interactions between users and designers about the functionalities and updates of the Physics Lab software. Users ask questions about where to find downloads and how to use the software, while designers provide updates on the software's capabilities and seek feedback.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, I will employ concepts from learning sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and participatory design. From the learning sciences perspective, I will examine how the interaction supports user learning and engagement with the software. In HCI, I will focus on usability issues and user experience as discussed in the interaction. For participatory design, I will look into how user feedback is solicited and incorporated into the software design process. Key questions will include: How do users express their needs and confusion? What types of support do designers provide? How are users involved in the design process?

# User Engagement

1. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, which may produce some weird results.
2. Designer: [Image 102]
3. Designer: Thank you for your support. We will do better!
4. P4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 104]
5. Designer: There will be an update. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version next weekend.
6. Designer: The update is quite substantial...
7. P4236: [Emoji 107]
8. P4234: [Emoji 108]
9. Designer: Don't worry, it will be done. We will optimize the circuit diagram in the final round.
10. Designer: Although manual layout adjustments are possible
11. Designer: It's still better to make the automatically generated one as good as possible
12. P4234: Yes, the spirit of continuous improvement like a skilled craftsman ðŸ¤”
13. Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that ensures long-term stability after implementation... Adding various components actually makes it simpler
14. Designer: The Apple Store is still under review, let's upload the PC version first
15. Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community covers a wide range of topics, from technical inquiries about semiconductor devices and superconductors to discussions on chemical experiments and laboratory equipment. Users engage with each other, provide feedback to the designer, and share images to support their communication. The designer addresses user concerns, emphasizes exam-focused learning, and discusses the development of educational software. Participants also touch upon the challenges of simulating complex experiments and express interest in comprehensive, free software solutions.
1. P2: What about superconductors?
Preliminary tags: material properties; electrical conductivity
2. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
Preliminary tags: simulation challenges; computational requirements
3. P1: If you can create a comprehensive and free software, it should be very popular.
Preliminary tags: software development; user popularity
4. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's game over.
5. P11: If you include all these, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
7. P11: Hey, good idea
8. P2: Hehe
9. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
10. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
11. Designer: The question is
12. Designer: Where does the light come from?
13. P11: What about light?
14. Designer: Are you shining a light bulb on a photosensitive resistor?
15. P2: Touch by hand
16. P14: I think there's no problem
17. Designer: Then it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
18. P2: With Xiaodeng
19. Designer: Microtransactions...
20. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
21. P2: ï¼Ÿ
22. P14: [Image 245]
23. Designer: Let's talk about it later
24. Designer: Can watch ads even without money
25. Designer: The practice of a conscience game
26. P1: Put up ads
27. Designer: Hmm.
28. P2: It doesn't conduct electricity when you touch it
29. Designer: Oh
30. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (...)
31. P11: ðŸ˜‚
32. P11: Just wanted to say
33. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but I simply don't know how to top up
34. P11: Can also adapt to 3D Touch
35. Designer: Can you top up directly on the app store?

Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation in the Physics Lab's online messaging group covers various topics related to high school physics and chemistry, including equipment, software, and exam preparation. Social interactions include sharing information, asking questions, providing explanations, expressing agreement, and making humorous comments.
1. P2: What about superconductors?
2. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
3. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
4. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
5. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
6. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
7. P11: Hey, good idea.
8. P2: Hehe.
9. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
10. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
11. Designer: The question is,
12. Designer: Where does the light come from?
13. P11: What about light?
14. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
15. P2: Touch it with your hand.
16. P14: I think there's no problem.
17. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
18. P2: And a small light.
19. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
20. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
21. P2: ï¼Ÿ
22. P14: [Image]
23. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
24. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
25. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
26. P1: Let's put up some ads.
27. Designer: Hmm.
28. P14: 
29. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
30. Designer: Oh.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Relationship: {The logical relationship between sub-codes in code 1}
Criteria: {Consolidated criteria of code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

1. technical inquiry, technical inquiries.
- Questions or requests related to technical aspects of the platform or functionality.
- Instances where users seek help or clarification on how to use the software or troubleshoot issues

2. product updates, technical updates.
- Announcements or discussions related to new features, changes, or updates to the Physics Lab product
- Information shared about technical updates, changes, or features being added to the Physics Lab.

Categories: 
* Platform Development
* Community Engagement

Definitions for each code:

1.
Relationship: Inclusive (technical inquiry is a broader category that encompasses technical inquiries)
Criteria: Questions or requests related to technical aspects of the platform or functionality, seeking help or clarification on how to use the software or troubleshoot issues
Label: Technical Support
Category: Technical Assistance

2.
Relationship: Parallel (product updates and technical updates are parallel sub-codes)
Criteria: Announcements or discussions related to new features, changes, or updates to the Physics Lab product, information shared about technical updates, changes, or features being added to the Physics Lab
Label: Platform Development
Category: Product Evolution

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: share update teasers, building anticipation for updates
- Designers share visual information or hints about upcoming updates with users.
- Designers demonstrate user engagement, building anticipation for updates or features, and set expectations for the release of new features.

2.
Concepts: expanding platform scope and capabilities, suggesting new features and experiments
- Users suggest the expansion of a product or feature to new platforms or suggest new software capabilities.
- Users propose practical applications or features, and suggest new experiment types or features to enhance the platform.

3.
Concepts: open feedback invitation, providing feedback and suggestions
- Users are encouraged to share their suggestions or requirements.
- Users provide specific feedback and suggestions for design improvements, and encourage others to do so.

Relationship: The designers' actions of sharing visual information and demonstrating user engagement are logically connected to build anticipation for updates.
Criteria: Designers share visual information or hints with users to build anticipation for updates or features.
Phrase: Tease updates to build anticipation.

2.
Concepts: expanding platform scope and capabilities, suggesting new features and experiments
Relationship: Users' suggestions for expansion and proposals for new features and experiments are logically connected to enhance the platform.
Criteria: Users suggest new features, experiments, or platform expansions to enhance capabilities.
Phrase: Suggest new features and experiments.

3.
Concepts: open feedback invitation, providing feedback and suggestions
Relationship: The open invitation for feedback and users' provision of specific feedback and suggestions are logically connected to encourage design improvements.
Criteria: Users provide specific feedback and suggestions for design improvements in response to an open invitation.
Phrase: Provide feedback and suggestions.

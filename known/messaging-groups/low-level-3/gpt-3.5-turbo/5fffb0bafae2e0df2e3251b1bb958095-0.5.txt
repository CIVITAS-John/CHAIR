You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (15 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
15. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer: Probably because the teacher finds too much talking annoying ðŸ˜‚
Preliminary tags: community norms; humor; teacher influence
2. P1: hello
Preliminary tags: greeting
3. P4: [Image 1-6]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
4. P5: ðŸ˜‚ By the way, I'm here to see if there are any good designs to reference.
Preliminary tags: design inspiration; seeking references; engagement
5. Designer: Good design?
Preliminary tags: design evaluation; engagement
6. P6: For example, a microcomputer.
Preliminary tags: design discussion; specific design example; engagement
7. Designer: Wait for the logic gates.
8. P2: The computer CPU is just logic gates.
9. P5: Hmm.
10. P5: I just need logic gates to make a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
11. P6: [Image 1-14]
12. P6: [Image 1-15]
13. P7: How to play?
14. Designer: Do experiments for fun. ðŸ˜‚
15. P8: Why did you suddenly add a wave?

Thoughts: In analyzing the conversation from the learning sciences perspective, consider how participants are engaging with the content, seeking references, and discussing specific examples like microcomputers and logic gates. From a human-computer interaction angle, focus on how images are shared, and the discussion around design evaluation and the use of Minecraft. Lastly, in the context of participatory design, look at how the community norms are established, the influence of the teacher, and the overall engagement and humor in the conversation.

Tags for each message:
1. community norms; humor; teacher influence
2. greeting
3. image sharing
4. design inspiration; seeking references; engagement
5. design evaluation; engagement
6. design discussion; specific design example; engagement
7. specific design example; engagement
8. technology discussion; specific design example
9. engagement
10. technology discussion; project planning
11. image sharing
12. image sharing
13. seeking guidance; engagement
14. community engagement; humor
15. seeking clarification; confusion

Summary: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community revolves around design evaluation, seeking references, and engaging in discussions about specific design examples like microcomputers and logic gates. Participants also share images, seek guidance, and display humor in their interactions. The influence of the teacher is evident in establishing community norms, and there is a mix of technology discussion and project planning happening within the group.

Notes: The community seems to be actively engaging with design concepts and technology discussions, with a playful and humorous tone present throughout the conversation. The sharing of images and seeking references indicates a collaborative and creative environment within the online community. The teacher's influence and the establishment of community norms are shaping the interactions among participants.

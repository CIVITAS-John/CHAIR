You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation revolves around the development of a software tool for physics education, particularly focused on circuit diagrams and experiments. The designer shares updates, features, and plans for the software, while the users provide feedback, feature requests, and discuss the potential use cases. The community seems to be actively engaged, providing suggestions and positive reactions to the ongoing development.
1. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
2. Designer: Hmm.
3. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
4. P4232: Indeed
5. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
6. Designer: I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
7. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
8. P4232: This is a really good idea
9. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
10. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

11. Designer: [Image]This one.
12. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.

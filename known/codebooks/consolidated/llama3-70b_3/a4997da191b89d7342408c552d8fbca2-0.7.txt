You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: confirm common style
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

2.
Label: updating on review process
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

3.
Label: explains reasons for schools disabling network on classroom computers
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

4.
Label: greets users with a smile
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

5.
Label: the conversation indicates an iterative development process influenced by user feedback and educational needs
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

6.
Label: resource request
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- User: Need the user manual for this software
- User: Is there a user manual?

7.
Label: adapting to user constraints
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

8.
Label: outlining a plan for simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

9.
Label: encouraging elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

10.
Label: building relationships with users
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

11.
Label: as well as adjustments to component properties and bug fixes
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

12.
Label: providing a suggestion to focus on categorization and refinement rather than completeness
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

13.
Label: inquiring about platform specifics
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

14.
Label: give examples of feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

15.
Label: revealing advanced development plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

16.
Label: considering the use of a virtual machine as a solution
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

17.
Label: seeking attention
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

18.
Label: praise software
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

19.
Label: expressing dissatisfaction with current avatar
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

20.
Label: explaining the decision to release the pc version first while waiting for apple store review
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

21.
Label: offering guidance
Quotes:
- User: Left side

22.
Label: balancing complexity with usability
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: Make it simpler...

23.
Label: acknowledging limitations of memory
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

24.
Label: introduce feature functoins
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: gaining efficiency with ai, recognizing ai's time-saving benefits
- Participants recognize AI's potential for efficiency gains.
- Participants recognize and acknowledge AI's time-saving benefits.

2.
Concepts: utilize ai-generated code in their work, refer to ai-generated code as a reference
- Participants use AI-generated code by copying or adopting it to support their work.
- Participants use AI-generated code as a reference to inform their work, avoiding direct copying and instead using it as a starting point for their own coding.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: gaining efficiency with ai, recognizing ai's time-saving benefits
Relationship: The two concepts are related as recognizing AI's time-saving benefits is a precursor to gaining efficiency with AI, as one must first acknowledge the benefits before utilizing them to increase efficiency.
Criteria: Participants recognize and utilize AI's time-saving benefits to gain efficiency in their work.
Phrase: Recognize AI-driven efficiency gains.

2.
Concepts: utilize ai-generated code in their work, refer to ai-generated code as a reference
Relationship: The two concepts are related as utilizing AI-generated code in their work is a more direct application, while referring to it as a reference is a more indirect or inspirational use.
Criteria: Participants use AI-generated code either directly or as a reference to inform their work.
Phrase: Leverage AI-generated code.

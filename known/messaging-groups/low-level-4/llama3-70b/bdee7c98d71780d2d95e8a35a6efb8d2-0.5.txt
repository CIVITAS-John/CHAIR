You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Phrases for each message (9 in total):
1. {interpretation of message 1}; ...
...
9. {interpretation of message 9}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: user 4230 requests dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves and optical experiments
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 outlines development priorities
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 promises to gather opinions before starting mechanics
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: user 4230 expresses gratitude
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: user 4231 inquires about downloading pc/interactive whiteboard version
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: user 4231 finds group files
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: In this initial coding, I'll focus on understanding the conversations between users and designers, identifying the needs and requests of users, and how designers respond to them. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective, examining how users engage with the Physics Lab online community and what they expect from it. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll analyze how users interact with designers and the platform. Finally, from a participatory design perspective, I'll explore how designers involve users in the development process.

Phrases for each message:
1. User-4230 requests dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves and optical experiments;
2. Designer 1 outlines development priorities, focusing on electrical and magnetic sections;
3. Designer 1 promises to gather opinions before starting mechanics;
4. User-4230 expresses gratitude towards designers;
5. User-4231 inquires about downloading PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab;
6. User-4231 finds group files;
7. Designer-1 shares an image (no clear interpretation yet);
8. Designer-1 announces changes to ideal components in the next update;
9. Designer-1 explains the capabilities of the student power supply.

Summary: The conversation starts with User-4230 requesting dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves and optical experiments. Designer-1 responds by outlining development priorities, which don't include mechanics yet. User-4230 expresses gratitude, and then User-4231 joins the conversation, asking about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab. Designer-1 shares an image, and then announces changes to ideal components and explains the capabilities of the student power supply.

Notes: It seems that users are actively engaged with the development process, requesting specific features and asking questions. Designers are responsive, providing updates on development priorities and explaining changes to the platform. The conversation suggests a collaborative atmosphere, with users and designers working together to shape the Physics Lab online community.

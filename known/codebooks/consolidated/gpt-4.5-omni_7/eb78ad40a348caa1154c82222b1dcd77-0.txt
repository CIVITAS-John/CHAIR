You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: suspecting ai bug, identifying ai misunderstandings and gaps in code
- Users suspect a bug in the AI due to unclear error messages and note discrepancies in AI's understanding of specific models.
- Users identify AI misunderstandings in code generation and note that AI-generated code can be incomplete, identifying missing code structures or elements.

2.
Concepts: experiences frustration, expressing frustration with ai
- Instances where E04 expresses frustration with the AI's performance or limitations.
- Users express frustration with AI hallucinating functions and dislike when AI gets stuck in loops and fails to resolve certain errors.

3.
Concepts: valuing ai debugging, valuing iterative improvement
- Users value AI's ability to resolve errors and perceive its role in iterative debugging and learning.
- Users value and emphasize iterative questioning and improvement with AI.

4.
Concepts: acknowledging limited time, valuing ai's time-saving potential
- Users acknowledge the time constraints in manually solving problems and see value in AI-generated solutions.
- Users value and highlight the time-saving potential and benefits of using AI tools.

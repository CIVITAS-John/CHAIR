You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for it.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
4. {Repeat the input 4}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 4, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 4}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 4}

~~~
1. Label: knowledge sharing and distribution, shared experiences and support
- Designers or users discuss sharing or distributing the software
- Users and designers sharing experiences and supporting each other in using and improving the software.

2. Label: platform variations, platform versions and updates
- Differences or variations between different platforms are mentioned
- Platform versions are mentioned, updates or releases are specific to a particular platform.

3. Label: xp limitation, constraints and limitations
- Discussions or mentions of limitations or restrictions in the simulation.
- Limitations or restrictions of a software or platform are mentioned

4. Label: feedback appreciation
- Expressing gratitude or appreciation for feedback or input, requesting specific feedback or input from teachers or users.
- Users or designers respond to previous statements, questions, or updates

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1. Label: knowledge sharing and distribution, shared experiences and support
Relationship: Parallel concepts
Criteria: Designers or users share knowledge, experiences, and support related to the software.
Label: Community Building

2. Label: platform variations, platform versions and updates
Relationship: Inclusion (platform versions and updates are specific types of platform variations)
Criteria: Discussions or mentions of differences, versions, or updates between or within platforms.
Label: Platform Evolution

3. Label: xp limitation, constraints and limitations
Relationship: Inclusion (limitations or restrictions of a software or platform are types of limitations in the simulation)
Criteria: Discussions or mentions of limitations or restrictions in the simulation, software, or platform.
Label: Limitations and Constraints

4. Label: feedback appreciation
Relationship: Parallel concepts
Criteria: Expressions of gratitude or requests for feedback or input from teachers or users, or responses to previous statements, questions, or updates.
Label: Feedback and Responsiveness

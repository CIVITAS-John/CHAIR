You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: prioritizing development roadmap
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

2.
Label: suggesting alternative operating system
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

3.
Label: planning community engagement
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

4.
Label: reflecting on input
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm.

5.
Label: exploring educational standards
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

6.
Label: clarifying version information
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

7.
Label: [ emoji 2 12] hello everyone
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

8.
Label: sharing context
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

9.
Label: proposing xp compatibility workarounds
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

10.
Label: defusing potential tension
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

11.
Label: xp compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

12.
Label: initiating interaction
Quotes:
- User: Hello everyone

13.
Label: offering alternative solution
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

14.
Label: introducing oneself
Quotes:
- User: Hello everyone

15.
Label: sharing positive user experience
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

16.
Label: showing interest in using the platform
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

17.
Label: contextualizing physics lab's focus
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

18.
Label: committing to iterative development
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

19.
Label: highlighting regional differences in hardware
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

20.
Label: this software is great! it's quite practical
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

21.
Label: explaining use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

22.
Label: enhancing user experience
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
- Designer: Make it simpler...

23.
Label: directing to resource
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

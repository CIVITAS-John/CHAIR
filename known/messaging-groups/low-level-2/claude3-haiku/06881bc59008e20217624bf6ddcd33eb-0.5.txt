Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation covers a range of technical discussions related to physics and chemistry, including equipment, software, and monetization strategies for a project. The participants share information, provide advice and suggestions, and engage in some social interactions such as agreements, acknowledgments, and a user mention. The conversation also includes some complaints and concerns about the use of ads in the app.
1. P2: What do you need ads for, @Designer 
2. Designer: Health...
3. Designer: Doing this requires hiring people...
4. P1: It's free.
5. Designer: Actually, it's similar to charging money, but if you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay...
6. P2: Oh.
7. Designer: Do more of it.
8. Designer: There are some other ways as well.
9. P8: The points wall is okay.
10. P8: @Designer I think it's okay.
11. P14: I also think it's great.
12. Designer: Actually, you can learn that mini program.
13. Designer: Creating questions, reviewing questions, and answering questions.
14. P14: What do you mean?
15. P14: [Image]
16. P17: Brain Out.
17. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
18. P18: Just downloaded it.

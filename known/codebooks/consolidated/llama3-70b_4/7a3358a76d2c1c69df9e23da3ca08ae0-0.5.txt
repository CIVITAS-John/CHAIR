You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: highlighting the significance of the update
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

2.

Quotes:
- Designer: We are working on this part

3.
Label: give rationale to development decision
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

4.

Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

5.
Label: acknowledging development progress
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

6.
Label: design question
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

7.
Label: recalls a past experience with touch screens and shares a workaround for bringing up the on screen keyboard
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

8.
Label: give examples of feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

Label: support feature inclusion
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

Label: there are unique challenges in designing for educational environments
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

12.
Label: explain current version's limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

13.
Label: discuss usability
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

14.
Label: demonstrating reflective thinking
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

15.
Label: providing technical explanation
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

18.
Label: designer 1 addresses input method
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

19.
Label: designer 1 explains bidirectional conversion
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

20.
Label: self answer
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

21.
Label: user 4232 highlights teaching needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

22.
Label: providing development timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

23.
Label: designer 1 references educational context
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

24.
Label: improve component accuracy
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

25.
Label: respond to the feature request
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

26.
Label: building anticipation
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation
- Designer: The update is quite large...

27.
Label: designer 2 provides technical information
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

Quotes:
- User: How to download?

30.
Label: shares workaround for on screen keyboard issue
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

31.
Label: user 4232 praises idea
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

32.
Label: future design plans/considerations
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate label to best represent the code.
The research question is: What ideas did students develop in this note?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {The most representative label for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: ai in urban sustainability, sustainable urban design in education
- Students propose AI applications and projects for sustainable urban design to integrate curriculum and knowledge-building.
- Students envision educational environments as models of sustainable cities and propose classroom tools to support ongoing learning in sustainable urban design.

2.
Concepts: local problem engagement, real-world learning applications
- Students address local problems and integrate broader contexts to enhance learning relevance and impact.
- Students stress addressing real-world challenges and applying learning to real-world contexts to enhance engagement and understanding.

3.
Concepts: propose symposiums, suggest sustainable city symposium
- Students propose organizing symposiums to share educational resources and practices.
- Suggesting a symposium where students present ideas on sustainable cities, incorporating diverse forms of expression and feedback.

4.
Concepts: continuous idea development, improvable ideas in learning
- Students focus on collaborative idea development and improvement through iterative processes and feedback.
- Students aim to improve ideas by connecting feedback processes with the principle of improvable ideas in learning experiences.

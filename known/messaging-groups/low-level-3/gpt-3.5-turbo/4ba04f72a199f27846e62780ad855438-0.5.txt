You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (19 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
19. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

===
Thoughts: The conversation seems to revolve around conducting experiments, sharing images, seeking clarification on certain topics, and discussing how to make things work. The community members are actively engaging with each other, seeking understanding, and acknowledging each other's contributions. The Designer seems to be observing and potentially guiding the conversation.

Tags for each message:
1. community engagement; experimentation; user engagement; conducting experiments
2. seeking clarification; topic expansion; wave addition; content discussion
3. understanding; acknowledgment
4. image sharing
5. image sharing
6. numerical response; engagement
7. seeking guidance; troubleshooting; seeking help
8. community moderation
9. equipment description; troubleshooting
10. simplicity appreciation
11. seeking guidance; troubleshooting
12. data display; equipment operation
13. equipment feature discussion
14. image sharing
15. equipment operation instruction
16. understanding; acknowledgment
17. image sharing
18. seeking guidance; troubleshooting
19. observation; silent participation; monitoring

Summary: The conversation involves community members engaging in experiments, sharing images, seeking clarification, troubleshooting equipment, discussing how to make things work, and seeking guidance on various topics. The Designer seems to be silently observing the conversation.

Notes: The Designer's role in the community seems more passive in this conversation, possibly letting the community members interact and troubleshoot amongst themselves. The focus on practical aspects like equipment operation and data display indicates a hands-on approach within the community.

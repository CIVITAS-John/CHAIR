You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: highlighted user friendly design
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

2.
Label: reassure user
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
- Designer: There will be.

3.
Label: user 4232 suggests features
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

4.
Label: inform users
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

5.
Label: designer 2 acknowledges user suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

6.
Label: planned detailed simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

7.
Label: shared visual reference
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

19.
Label: ask about user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

21.
Label: provided development plan information
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

22.
Label: development goals
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

23.
Label: clarify testing status
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

24.
Label: confirmation
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.
- Designer: Hmm hmm.
- Designer: ðŸ˜‚

25.
Label: share ongoing research

- Designer: Does the class have internet?

27.
Label: future update
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

28.
Label: maintain positive interaction
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

29.

32.
Label: user input/feedback/suggestion with justifications
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

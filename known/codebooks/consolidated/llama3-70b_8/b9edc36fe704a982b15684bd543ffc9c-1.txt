You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

===
Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: discussing ai's potential, discussing ai's educational potential
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve discussing AI's potential, with a specific focus on educational potential being a subset of the broader discussion of AI's potential.
Criteria: Users discuss AI's potential benefits and its potential to provide learning support.
Phrase: Envisioning AI's potential.

---
2.
Concepts: integrates ai-generated code, integrating ai into workflows
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve the integration of AI into existing work processes, with a focus on integrating AI-generated code being a specific aspect of this broader integration process.
Criteria: Users integrate AI-generated code into models and workflows.
Phrase: Integrating AI into practices.

---
3.
Concepts: learning effort, describing learning curve challenges
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the difficulties users face when learning to use AI-driven systems, with learning effort being a general term and describing learning curve challenges being a specific aspect of this effort.
Criteria: Users experience challenges or devote effort to learning AI-driven systems.
Phrase: Overcoming learning hurdles.

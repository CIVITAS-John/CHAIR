You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not write repetitive ones.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- That's great, I hope it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no software that is convenient for drawing circuit diagrams for the circuit part of the exam
- If there could be an export function, or save and import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set the parameters in the office and import them directly in class.
- Suggest adding an exit button function for the PC version, as many regions now use all-in-one touchscreens without a physical keyboard.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* community dynamics
* knowledge co-construction
* platform design and support
* theoretical perspectives

Qualitative codes:
1. expressing interest and curiosity
Participants demonstrate engagement and enthusiasm for the design process by asking questions, sharing ideas, and expressing interest in the outcomes.

2. onboarding and integration
Processes and strategies used to welcome and support new members in the community.

3. use of platform features
How participants utilize the online platform and its features to communicate and collaborate.

4. challenges and adaptations
Difficulties encountered in the online environment and how participants adapt to overcome them.

5. participant roles
The different roles and contributions of community members in shaping the platform and its activities.

6. community feedback

16. moderator/admin roles
This code refers to the roles and responsibilities of moderators or administrators within the online community.

17. peer leadership
This code refers to how members take on leadership roles and responsibilities within the online community.

18. brevity
Participants in the group use brief and concise responses to convey information effectively in the online setting.

19. external references
Participants in the group refer to external resources, such as search engines, to provide additional information to the newcomer.

20. explaining shared meaning
Participants explain the meaning of shared expressions or concepts to help others understand the community's norms and practices.

21. platform affordances
The features and capabilities of the online platform that enable or constrain community interactions.

22. community contributions
The ways in which participants actively shape and contribute to the development of the online community.

23. scaffolding and peer support
Instances where participants provide support, guidance, or assistance to help others understand concepts or complete tasks.

24. technological affordances
Instances where participants discuss or utilize the capabilities and limitations of the software, hardware, or online platform.

25. accessibility
Considerations about the ability of middle school students to access and use the physics lab simulation software, particularly in terms of payment methods and technical barriers.

26. user involvement
Instances where participants actively contribute ideas, feedback, or suggestions for the development of the physics lab simulation software.

27. co-creation and collaborative design
Instances where community members collaborate or work together to shape the design and features of the online platform.

28. tool exploration
Instances where community members are asking questions or sharing information about how to use the new tool.

29. technical support
Instances where community members are discussing technical issues or seeking help with the tool.

30. community responsiveness

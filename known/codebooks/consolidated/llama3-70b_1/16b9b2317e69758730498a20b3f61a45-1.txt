You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

3.
Label: seeking community input
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

4.

19.
Label: acknowledge user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

20.
Label: explanation of upcoming features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

21.
Label: compare feature complexities
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

22.
Label: set development scope
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

23.
Label: future design plan
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

24.
Label: invite user participation
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

25.
Label: testing phase
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

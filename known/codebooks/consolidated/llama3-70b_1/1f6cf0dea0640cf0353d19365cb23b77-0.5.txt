You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

2.

29.
Label: setting realistic timelines
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

30.
Label: providing context for software use
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

31.
Label: development goals

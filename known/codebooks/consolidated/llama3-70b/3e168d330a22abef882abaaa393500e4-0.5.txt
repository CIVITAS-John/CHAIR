You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

Definitions for each code:

1. reasoning, give rationale to development decision.
Relationship: Inclusion (rationale is a type of reasoning)
Criteria: Providing a justification or explanation for a development decision.
Label: Rationale for Development Decisions
Category: Design Decision-Making

2. design goals, design rationale.
Relationship: Parallel (both are related to design decisions)
Criteria: Explaining the purpose, need, or principle behind a design or feature.
Label: Design Rationale
Category: Design Decision-Making

3. contextualization.
Relationship: Standalone (contextualization is a distinct concept)
Criteria: Providing or seeking background information or context for understanding.
Label: Contextual Understanding
Category: Contextual Understanding

4. design suggestions.
Relationship: Parallel (related to design, but distinct from design rationale)
Criteria: Providing ideas or proposals for improvement or development.
Label: Design Suggestions

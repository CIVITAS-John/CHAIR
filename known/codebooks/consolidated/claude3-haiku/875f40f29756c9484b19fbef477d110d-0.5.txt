You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. feedback and iteration, iterative design.
- The exchange of feedback between users and the designer, and the designer's responsiveness to that feedback.
- The process of continuously refining the software based on user feedback and testing, as well as the designer's efforts to incorporate the community's input and ideas into the software's development.

2. feedback integration, feedback.
- The designer's efforts to incorporate user feedback and improve the educational value of the software.
- Mechanisms within the software that provide students with immediate feedback on their actions and understanding, and the designers' active efforts to seek feedback and input from the community members to inform the design of the simulated electricity experiment assessment feature.

3. software download, software version release.
- Statements about downloading the Physics Lab software.
- Statements about the release of a new version of the Physics Lab software.

4. design updates, development process.
- Discussions related to updates, changes, or improvements made to the Physics Lab software.
- Discussions that provide insights into the development process of the Physics Lab software.

5. learning support, pedagogical approach.
- Discussions that address the software's ability to support learning and educational activities.
- Discussions that relate to the educational or pedagogical aspects of the Physics Lab software.

6. educational context, community support.
- The role of education and teaching within the online community.
- The ways in which the online community members support each other's learning and troubleshooting.

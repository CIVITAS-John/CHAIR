You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation begins with a user politely requesting assistance, followed by a designer encouraging group sharing and announcing upcoming updates. Users express enthusiasm and positivity towards the announced updates. A user requests a user manual, to which the designer responds by asking about encountered problems during use. The designer explains the goal of intuitive design and the possibility of providing prompts upon first use. The user clarifies the need for a user manual due to the school's information-based focus. Another user suggests a feature for easy circuit diagram drawing and background grid hiding for test paper screenshots. The designer shares ongoing research into bidirectional conversion between physical and circuit diagrams and mentions plans for manual editing functionality. A user requests the inclusion of mechanics experiments, to which the designer acknowledges the request but mentions the need to prioritize electromagnetism first.
1. User-4235: Can you also include mechanics experiments?
Preliminary phrases: requesting the inclusion of mechanics experiments
2. Designer-1: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary phrases: explaining the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
3. Designer-1: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
Preliminary phrases: acknowledging the request for mechanics experiments; mentioning the need to prioritize electromagnetism first
4. User-4232: Oh, this is nice
5. Designer-1: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
6. User-4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
7. Designer-1: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application
8. User-4234: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji 2-80]
9. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
10. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
11. Designer-1: Hmm.
12. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
13. User-4232: Indeed
14. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
15. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
16. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
17. User-4232: This idea is really good
18. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
19. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
20. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
21. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

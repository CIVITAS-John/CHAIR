You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (5 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
5. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

Thoughts: Analyzing this conversation from multiple theoretical angles, I'm interested in exploring how the Designer's role influences the online community's emergence. How do the participants' roles (e.g., teacher) impact their interactions? What are the community's norms and expectations around content sharing (e.g., uploading high-definition images)? How does the Designer's responsiveness shape the community's dynamics?

Tags for each message:
1. (no text, just an image)
2. Designer; Avatar customization; Uncensored content; High-definition image; Request
3. PC version; Platform inquiry
4. Designer; Avatar upload; Responsive design; Teacher identification
5. Teacher role; Self-identification

Summary: The conversation starts with an image shared by P8, followed by a request from P4229 to upload a high-definition version of the avatar. The Designer responds, offering to upload the image and inquiring about P4229's role as a teacher.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the Designer takes an active role in facilitating the conversation and accommodating users' requests. The mention of a "crappy avatar" might suggest that users are interested in customizing their online presence. The teacher's self-identification might imply that the community values professional roles or expertise.

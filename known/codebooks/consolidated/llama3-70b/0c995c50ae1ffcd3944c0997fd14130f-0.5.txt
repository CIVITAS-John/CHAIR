You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1.
Relationship: {The logical relationship between sub-codes in code 1}
Criteria: {Consolidated criteria of code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

Here is the output format for the given codes:

---
Categories: 
* Facilitation Strategies
* Information Sharing
* Instructional Design

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Relationship: Hierarchical (use of visual aids is a broader category that includes visual facilitation)
Criteria: The use of images, diagrams, or videos to facilitate understanding, instruction, or information sharing within the online community.
Label: Visual Facilitation
Category: Visual Instruction

2.
Relationship: Inclusive (visual facilitation is a sub-code of use of visual aids)
Criteria: The role of images in facilitating understanding and instruction within the conversation.
Label: Image-based Instruction
Category: Visual Instruction

3.
Relationship: Parallel (use of visual media is a separate code that overlaps with use of visual aids)
Criteria: The use of visual media to share information, facilitate understanding, or provide visual references within the online community.
Label: Visual Information Sharing
Category: Information Sharing

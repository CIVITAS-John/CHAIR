You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (32 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: maintain a forward looking perspective
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

2.
Label: user 4232 provides feedback
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

19.
Label: acknowledge user's explanation
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.

20.
Label: consult on educational standards
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

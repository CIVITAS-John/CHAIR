You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: highlights ai's speed and cost effectiveness
Quotes:
- E01: It's like, I could hire an intern to like do this, or I could have chat GPT do it much faster for free. And, and, and even if chat GPT doesn't do it today, I bet six months from now, it would do it. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT is free and advances fast.

2.
Label: values strategic questioning in ai use
Quotes:
- E01: If you know how to ask iterative questions, I think it could do pretty well. (interviewer's observation) E01 thinks ChatGPT would do well if one knows how to ask iterative questions.

3.
Label: seeks ai to integrate user feedback
Quotes:
- E01: I call it hive feedback system, where if anyone in the world learns a new fact, or like, Oh, if you're a nurse, here's the word. If you're a transcriptionist, here's the word. If anybody learns it, then it goes into the system into the cloud. And now the cloud won't make that mistake anymore. And then the developer doesn't have to solve all these problems, because all the users solve their own problems. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how the human-AI collaborative system could be used to increase general productivity.

4.
Label: describing difficulty in solving complex net logo problems
Quotes:
- E01: The problem I posted was about 100 pages of NetLogo and then 100 pages, 100 lines of NetLogo. And it was a real problem that I had looked at. I would love to help this person, but this is going to take me minimum of two hours to figure out what are they trying to do? (interviewer's observation) Although AI made mistake, E01 still believes in the value in having an AI-generated solution (compared with no solution or no help).

5.
Label: suggests treating ai as a person
Quotes:
- E01: I speak to (ChatGPT) like a person. I could just walk in the room and go write me code that does X, but I don't, I start with good morning. And it comes back, but it comes back with good morning. How can I assist you today? It's pretty good at figuring out natural language. So in some sense that you might just be better off, just pretend it's not a computer. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how he interacts with ChatGPT like a person.

6.
Label: faces compatibility issues
Quotes:
- E04: I guess, in their databases, they still have like, NetLogo 5 in there and stuff. So like, for example, you know, the anonymous functions, they still use like, the old, sometimes I'll get like, the old functionality for the anonymous functions. (interviewer's observation) Writing code in older versions of NetLogo

7.
Label: indicates long term engagement with coding
Quotes:

9.
Label: suggests ai could help with learning scope
Quotes:
- E01: And I find what I have trouble with and certainly what beginners have trouble with is "scope".   You know, when you go from one point to another and all of a sudden you're, you're not no longer in ask turtles to do something you're in, ask links to do. But you know, so all of a sudden you've shifted, you've shifted your variable space and this happens implicitly and all of a sudden you're writing code and then it gives you an error that of the nature X Y Z doesn't operate in a turtle context. (interviewer's observation) AI needs to support learning of the "scope" concept in NetLogo.

10.
Label: emphasizing long term experience
Quotes:
- E01: I started programming in 1964 at IBM. ... And since then I have programmed in production code in at least 20 different software languages. (interviewer's observation) E01's prior experiences in computer programming in general.

11.
Label: observing progressive refinement
Quotes:
- E01: This is what conversations with ChatGPT typically look like. I had to go through about eight separate times to get all the errors out of it.  But, but look at how it structured the code. Look at the things that did look what you could learn from this. This is valuable. (interviewer's observation) Users may benefit from the iterative debugging process during working with AI, even though AI might give wrong answers.

12.
Label: suggesting need for improved error reporting
Quotes:
- E01: I think a lot of people, because they're very subtle, and then the error message is no help whatsoever to the user. You're, you're adding two variables over here and it's complaining about something over there. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's error messages could be unhelpful.

13.
Label: critiques the individualistic work culture's impact on seeking help
Quotes:
- E01: What you have in America is this, this cult of individualism to a point of obsession. And people don't naturally stop and go, how can I get help with this? (interviewer's observation) Continued: reflection on the individualism.

14.
Label: interviewee continuing reflection on the individualism
Quotes:
- E01: What you have in America is this, this cult of individualism to a point of obsession. And people don't naturally stop and go, how can I get help with this? (interviewer's observation) Continued: reflection on the individualism.

15.
Label: highlighting difficulty with linear learning approaches
Quotes:
- E01: I cannot learn like that. I'm sorry. I am not a top left first page to last page. So if AI can help find a good place to start and manage that learning process, then I think that's astounding. (interviewer's observation) Critique on the existing situation of technical documentation and imagine that AI could improve the learning process.

16.
Label: demonstrating proactive problem solving
Quotes:
- E04: "Can train-perceptron be turned into a reporter" (interviewer's observation) E04 uses "can you fix with my own idea".

17.
Label: limited time availability
Quotes:
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time. (interviewer's observation) AI could potentially save time for learning new extensions (compared with core concepts) of NetLogo.

18.
Label: directs ai with clear instructions
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a simple feed-forward neural network in NetLogo with one hidden layer."

19.
Label: reads error messages
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 reads error messages before making a choice.

20.
Label: stresses utility for novice users
Quotes:
- E04: And it could take a lot of time to like search the documentation and go online and try and figure out all those answers and just to have it like right there. So you can kind of stay within the task is really nice. (interviewer's observation) The capability to search for documentation and read it inside the workspace: esp. beneficial for novices.

21.
Label: prefers straightforward tasks
Quotes:
- E04: The typical idea that I had was like a very, very simple neural network. (interviewer's observation) Task: a very simple neural network

22.
Label: finds ai useful for translating models
Quotes:
- E04: I've found that AI is really helpful for like, translating other models from other languages into NetLogo, for example. (interviewer's observation) Helpful for translating from other languages into NetLogo

23.
Label: e04 values simple and understandable explanations
Quotes:
- E04: It seems to explain things pretty well, it does not seems to be overly technical. (interviewer's observation) Provides clear, less technical explanations.

24.
Label: predicting user convenience
Quotes:
- E01: And you want doctors to use it, nurses to use it and medical transcriptionists to use it. They use a different word for whatever the verb for whatever it is you're saying you want them to do. And so, in some sense, their documentation has to be customized to their context to their user group. ... It's a language system. If you have a learning system that's actually capable of harvesting information, yeah, and a lot of them are not yet, but I think we'll get there. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to translate jargons between different sub-groups working in the same systems and ease the cost of writing customized documentation.

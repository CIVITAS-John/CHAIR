You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (32 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...

32. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary codes: polite expression; apology; social courtesy
2. Designer-2: Group sharing.
Preliminary codes: feature suggestion; collaboration idea; group functionality
3. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
Preliminary codes: technical support; resource sharing; file sharing
4. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
Preliminary codes: development roadmap; feature announcement; community engagement
5. User-4234: [Emoji 2-56]
Preliminary codes: emoji
6. User-4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]
Preliminary codes: emotional expression; positive feedback
7. User-4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer-1: Hello :)
9. User-4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer-1: [Image 2-61] Updates in preparation
11. Designer-1: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
12. Designer-1: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
13. User-4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer-1: What problems did you encounter during use?
15. Designer-1: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
16. User-4235: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school
17. User-4235: Need the user manual for this software
18. Designer-1: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
19. User-4232: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
20. Designer-1: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer-1: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
22. User-4235: Can you also include mechanics experiments?
23. Designer-1: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer-1: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
25. User-4232: Oh, this is nice
26. Designer-1: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
27. User-4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer-1: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application
29. User-4234: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji 2-80]
30. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
31. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer-1: Hmm.

Thoughts: 
For this first round of coding, I plan to focus on describing each message with low-level codes, trying to capture the events, actors, and intents behind each message. I will consider the research question, "How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?" and analyze the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will also look for patterns, relationships, and themes emerging from the codes.

Codes for each message:
1. polite expression; apology; social courtesy
2. feature suggestion; collaboration idea; group functionality
3. technical support; resource sharing; file sharing
4. development roadmap; feature announcement; community engagement
5. emoji
6. emotional expression; positive feedback
7. greeting
8. greeting; social courtesy
9. inquiry about updates
10. update announcement; visual aid
11. development update; timeline
12. feature list; development roadmap
13. inquiry about user manual
14. inquiry about user experience
15. design philosophy; user-centered design
16. context setting; educational setting
17. request for user manual
18. offer for private conversation
19. feature suggestion; usability feedback
20. research announcement; bidirectional conversion
21. development roadmap; manual editing
22. feature request; mechanics experiments
23. research announcement; bidirectional conversion
24. development roadmap; prioritization
25. positive feedback
26. development timeline
27. positive feedback; 3D effect
28. research announcement; bidirectional conversion
29. positive feedback; emoji
30. research announcement; bidirectional conversion
31. advice on development; categorization
32. acknowledgement

Summary:
The conversation starts with social courtesies and greetings. The designers announce updates, share resources, and provide technical support. Users ask about updates, request features, and provide feedback on usability. The designers share their development roadmap, research announcements, and design philosophies. The conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab, with a focus on collaboration, user-centered design, and community engagement.

Notes:
From this first round of coding, it appears that the designers are actively engaging with the users, sharing updates, and soliciting feedback. The users are providing valuable feedback, suggesting features, and asking questions. The conversation is collaborative and focused on the development of Physics Lab. I hypothesize that this online community is emerging through the interactions between designers and users, with a strong emphasis on participatory design and user-centered development.

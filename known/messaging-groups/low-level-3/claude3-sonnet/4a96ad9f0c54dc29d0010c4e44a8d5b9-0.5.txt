You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (13 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...

13. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P8: [Image 0]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
Preliminary tags: developer response; feature request
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
Preliminary tags: user role; teacher; clarifying question
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary tags: image sharing; user role inquiry
5. P4229: Yes.
Preliminary tags: user role; teacher; confirmation
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are in the group announcement.
7. Designer: Feel free to share any suggestions and needs.
8. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
9. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
10. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
13. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.

Summary: The conversation revolves around the development of a physics simulation software called "Physics Lab". The designer is interacting with users, likely teachers, to gather feedback and suggestions for future updates. One user requests features related to wave simulations and optical experiments, while the designer indicates that they are prioritizing completing the electricity and magnetism sections first. The designer also invites users to share suggestions and needs, and provides information about downloading the software. Users express appreciation for the designer's work and seek clarification on specific aspects of the software.

Notes: The online community around Physics Lab seems to be emerging as a collaborative space for users (teachers) to provide feedback and suggestions, while the designer gathers input to shape the development roadmap. The designer appears to be actively engaging with users, prioritizing certain features based on feedback, and providing updates on the software's progress. This dynamic interaction between the designer and users could be a key factor in the community's emergence and growth.

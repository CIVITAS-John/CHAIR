1. P8: [Image]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.
6. Designer: 
7. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are in the group announcement.
8. Designer: Feel free to share any suggestions and needs.
9. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
10. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
11. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
12. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
13. P4231: [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?

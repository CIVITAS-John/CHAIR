You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: debugging and troubleshooting, identify and debug errors with ai assistance
- The process by which the interviewee identifies and fixes errors in the code, often with the help of the LLM-driven interface.
- Interviewees express that the AI assists with troubleshooting and clarifying errors in coding.

2.
Concepts: acknowledge ai's limitations, accept limitations of ai and human abilities
- Interviewees reflect on AI's limitations stemming from its reliance on outdated datasets.
- Interviewees recognize the limitations of AI and human abilities in solving complex problems.

3.
Concepts: propose ideas to ai, seek specific code from ai
- Users request AI to implement their ideas or suggest alternative methods for coding tasks.
- Users provide specific requests for code generation to initiate tasks with AI.

4.
Concepts: highlight programming expertise, advocate for ai in concept understanding
- Interviewees emphasize their programming skills and how these contribute to their interaction with AI.
- Interviewees advocate for AI's role in helping understand programming concepts like scope.

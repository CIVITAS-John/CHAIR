You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* User roles
* User involvement strategies
=> User engagement

* Design elements
* Design feedback and iteration
=> Design development

* Network accessibility
* Technical challenges
* Technology updates
=> Technical aspects

* Learning environment creation
* Experiment design
=> Environment and experiment design

* Social interaction
* Digital community building
=> Community interaction

# Reflection
- More categories for merging could include "Design elements" and "Design feedback and iteration" into a broader category like "Design process."
- "User support" could be merged with "User involvement strategies" to form a more comprehensive category related to user engagement and support.
- The naming is accurate and aligns well with the research context.

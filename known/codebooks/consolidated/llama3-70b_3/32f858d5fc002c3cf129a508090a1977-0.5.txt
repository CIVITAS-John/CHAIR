You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: visualizing design options, proposing design ideas
Relationship: The concepts are related as visualizing design options is a precursor to proposing design ideas, as it involves presenting possibilities that can then be built upon or modified.
Criteria: Designers present and suggest design solutions or improvements.
Phrase: Propose design solutions

2.
Concepts: ensure technical compatibility, setting expectations for app compatibility based on hardware age
Relationship: The concepts are related as ensuring technical compatibility involves setting expectations for app compatibility, which is influenced by hardware age.
Criteria: Designers specify platform and software requirements and consider hardware age for app compatibility.
Phrase: Ensure technical compatibility

3.
Concepts: encourage feedback
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Designers actively seek, initiate, and maintain open communication channels for user feedback.
Phrase: Encourage user feedback

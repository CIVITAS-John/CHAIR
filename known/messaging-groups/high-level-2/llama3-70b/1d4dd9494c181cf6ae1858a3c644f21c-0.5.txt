Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a user thanking the designers for their hard work. A new user asks about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab, finds the group files, and receives updates from designers about upcoming changes to the simulation. Users ask for clarification on using the PC version and receive technical information.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do users interact with designers and each other? How do designers respond to user inquiries and provide updates? What features of the online community facilitate or hinder user engagement?

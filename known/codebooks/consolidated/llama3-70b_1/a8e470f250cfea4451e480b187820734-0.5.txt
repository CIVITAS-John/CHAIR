You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

15.
Label: design principles
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

16.
Label: design suggestion
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

17.
Label: user 4229 provides personal context
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

18.
Label: suggest practical use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

19.
Label: confirm preference
Quotes:
- User: Left side

20.
Label: outlined development timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

21.
Label: acknowledged future manual editing
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

22.
Label: designer 2 informs about system compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

23.
Label: designer 1 acknowledges usability limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

24.
Label: ask followup question on usage scenario
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

25.
Label: gratitude
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

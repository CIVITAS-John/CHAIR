You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: recognize the need for expertise, recognizes the need for human effort
Relationship: The need for expertise and human effort are interconnected, as participants recognize that human expertise is necessary to understand and use AI-generated code effectively.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge the necessity for human expertise in debugging and understanding AI-generated code.
Phrase: Acknowledge the need for human expertise.

2.
Concepts: recognizing ai's input limitations, recognize llm-driven interfaces' capacity limitations
Relationship: Recognizing AI's input limitations and LLM-driven interfaces' capacity limitations are related, as users identify the boundaries of what AI can accomplish and the limitations of the interfaces themselves.
Criteria: Users identify the limitations of AI's input and the capacity of LLM-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Identify AI's limitations.

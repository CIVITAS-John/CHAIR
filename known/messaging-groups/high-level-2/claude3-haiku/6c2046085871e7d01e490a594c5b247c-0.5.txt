Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

* Summary
The conversation starts with a message from a user named "Designer" indicating that they have completed a task. This is followed by a response from "P5" expressing amusement. "P8" then requests an admin for the group, and "P13" asks if all the members are top students. "P14" responds that they are not, and this is followed by several users expressing agreement with "P14's" statement. Finally, "P10" asks what the "+1" expression means, and "P11" explains that it indicates agreement or support.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can focus on the following factors:

1. Community formation and participation: How are new members introduced and welcomed into the group? What are the norms and expectations for participation?
2. Knowledge sharing and learning: How do members engage in knowledge sharing and learning within the group?
3. Roles and leadership: How are roles and leadership established within the group?
4. Communication and interaction patterns: How do members communicate and interact with each other?
5. User experience and interface design: How does the online platform and interface facilitate or hinder the group's activities and interactions?

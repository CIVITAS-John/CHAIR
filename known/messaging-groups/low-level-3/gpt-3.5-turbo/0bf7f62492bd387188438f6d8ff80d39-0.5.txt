You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
9. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P14: Except me
Preliminary tags: self deprecation; community comparison; user perspective
2. P13: ＋1
Preliminary tags: community agreement; affirmation; user contribution
3. P15: +1 again
Preliminary tags: community agreement; user contribution; social interaction
4. P16: ＋1
Preliminary tags: community agreement; user contribution; social interaction
5. P10: May I ask what "+1" means?
Preliminary tags: community norms; symbol interpretation; user guidance
6. P11: It means I feel the same way.
Preliminary tags: social interaction; symbol interpretation; user clarification
7. P13: +1 means having the same opinion
8. P13: emmmm
9. P13: You can check Baidu

Thoughts: When analyzing the emergence of Physics Lab's online community, consider the dynamics of user contributions and interactions. How do users affirm each other's opinions and how do they seek clarification on community norms and symbols? What role does self-deprecation play in shaping individual perspectives within the community? How does the designer's presence influence user behaviors and the overall community development?

Tags for each message:
1. self-deprecation; community comparison; user perspective
2. community agreement; affirmation; user contribution
3. community agreement; user contribution; social interaction
4. community agreement; user contribution; social interaction
5. community norms; symbol interpretation; user guidance
6. social interaction; symbol interpretation; user clarification
7. community norms; affirmation; user contribution
8. hesitation; uncertainty; user behavior
9. external resource suggestion; information sharing; user guidance

Summary: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community showcases various aspects of community building, including user contributions, social interactions, symbol interpretations, and seeking clarification on community norms. Users engage in affirming each other's opinions through symbols like "+1" while also seeking guidance and clarification when needed. The presence of the designer is not directly evident in the conversation, but users display a sense of community norms and behaviors that may have been influenced by the designer's initial design choices.

Notes: The users in the community seem to have established a shared understanding of certain symbols and norms, indicating a level of community cohesion. However, there are instances of users seeking external resources for information, which could suggest a need for clearer guidelines or explanations within the community platform. Further exploration of the designer's role in shaping these community norms and interactions could provide valuable insights into the community's emergence.

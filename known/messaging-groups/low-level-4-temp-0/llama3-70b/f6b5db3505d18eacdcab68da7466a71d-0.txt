You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (10 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
10. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: expressing understanding; showing appreciation; acknowledging effort
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: greeting the community; inquiring about resources; seeking support
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: finding resources; expressing gratitude; feeling relieved
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary phrases: announcing changes; explaining updates; setting new expectations
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary phrases: explaining features; highlighting capabilities; educating users
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on understanding the interactions between users and designers, identifying the types of support being sought and provided, and recognizing the tone and language used in the conversation. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective to analyze how users are learning about Physics Lab, the human-computer interaction perspective to examine how users are interacting with the platform, and the participatory design perspective to see how designers are involving users in the development process. Guiding questions include: What are users trying to accomplish in Physics Lab? How are designers responding to user needs and feedback? What is the role of resources and support in the community?

Interpretations for each message:

1. expressing understanding; showing appreciation; acknowledging effort
2. greeting the community; inquiring about resources; seeking support
3. finding resources; expressing gratitude; feeling relieved
4. sharing visual information; providing context
5. announcing changes; explaining updates; setting new expectations
6. explaining features; highlighting capabilities; educating users
7. soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; fostering engagement
8. seeking guidance; asking for tutorials; requesting support
9. sharing visual examples; illustrating questions; seeking clarification
10. providing technical information; explaining limitations; setting boundaries

Summary: The conversation begins with users expressing appreciation and seeking resources, followed by designers providing information and updates about Physics Lab. Users ask questions about using the platform, and designers respond with explanations and guidance. The tone is collaborative, with designers encouraging feedback and users seeking support.

Notes: It appears that users are still learning about Physics Lab and its capabilities, and designers are actively involved in providing support and guidance. The use of images and emojis suggests a friendly and approachable tone in the community. I hypothesize that the designers' participatory approach will continue to shape the community's dynamics and influence the development of Physics Lab.

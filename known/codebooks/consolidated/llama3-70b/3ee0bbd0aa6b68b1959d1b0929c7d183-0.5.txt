You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Relationship: {The logical relationship between sub-codes in code 1}
Criteria: {Consolidated criteria of code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

~~~
1. chemistry, chemistry module.
- Topics or concepts related to chemistry
- Potential development of a chemistry module

2. mechanics experiments, experimental details.
- Experiments or topics related to mechanics
- Details mentioned in the context of an experiment or assessment.

Here is the output format for the thematic analysis:

---
Categories: 
* Content Development
* Physics Experimentation

Definitions for each code:

1.
Relationship: Inclusive (chemistry is a broader topic that includes chemistry module)
Criteria: Discussion of chemistry concepts, development of a module focused on chemistry
Label: Chemistry Content
Category: Content Development

2.
Relationship: Parallel (mechanics experiments and experimental details are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Discussion of experiments or topics related to mechanics, or details mentioned in the context of an experiment or assessment
Label: Mechanics Experimentation
Category: Physics Experimentation

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: addressing educational needs, institutional needs and goals
Relationship: Inclusion (addressing educational needs is a part of institutional needs and goals)
Criteria: Users or designers discuss or explain educational requirements, institutional objectives, or goals related to online community activities.
Label: Identifying Institutional Objectives

2.
Concepts: seeking product information, information seeking
Relationship: Parallel (seeking product information and information seeking are two related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Users ask questions, seek clarification, or express curiosity about the product or its features, and may indicate finding the necessary information.
Label: Information Inquiry

3.
Concepts: community building
Relationship: Intersection (fostering community and collaborative problem-solving intersect with friendly greetings and addresses)
Criteria: Designers or users engage in activities that promote a sense of community, collaboration, or friendly interaction, such as greetings or collaborative problem-solving.
Label: Building Online Community

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

19. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: outlining plans; detailing features; generating excitement
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: expressing enthusiasm; validating idea; encouraging progress
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: promising inclusivity; soliciting feedback; building community
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: seeking expertise; consulting stakeholders; gathering input
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: soliciting confirmation; clarifying understanding; ensuring accuracy
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: providing confirmation; sharing knowledge; establishing common ground
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Thoughts: 
In this initial round of coding, I plan to focus on identifying the key actions, intentions, and interactions between the designers and users in the Physics Lab online community. I will examine the language used, the tone, and the responses to understand the dynamics of the community. From the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, I will explore how the designers and users collaborate, share knowledge, and build on each other's ideas. Guiding questions include: How do the designers solicit feedback and input from the users? How do the users respond to the designers' ideas and prototypes? What are the key features and functionalities being discussed, and how do they relate to the learning goals of the Physics Lab?

Summary: 
In this conversation, the designers and users of the Physics Lab online community engage in a collaborative discussion about the development of a new feature for simulated experiment assessment. The designers solicit feedback, input, and expertise from the users, who respond with enthusiasm, validation, and guidance. The conversation revolves around the design and implementation of the feature, with a focus on usability, accuracy, and simplicity. The designers and users work together to refine the design, explore alternatives, and test assumptions.

Notes: 
It appears that the designers are committed to building an inclusive and participatory community, where users are encouraged to provide feedback and input. The users seem to appreciate this approach, as they respond with enthusiasm and validation. The conversation suggests that the designers are open to compromise and willing to consider alternative solutions. The use of images and emojis adds a layer of informality and friendliness to the conversation, which may contribute to the sense of community and collaboration.

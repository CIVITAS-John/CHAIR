You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

~~~
1. collaborative problem solving, participatory problem-solving.
- Moments where decisions are made or problems are solved collectively with input from multiple community members.
- Discussions where community members engage collectively to solve a problem or improve a system aspect, demonstrating participatory design.

2. user-driven design feedback, designer's responsiveness to user feedback in the design process.
- Instances where user suggestions potentially influence design modifications and where acknowledgment from designers about user feedback is evident.
- Evidence of the designer acknowledging, responding to, and incorporating feedback and suggestions from users or stakeholders into the design and development process.

3. designer updates, designer communication.
- Instances where the designer provides updates, information, or responds to user queries.
- Interaction between the designer and the community, focusing on responses to inquiries, updates, and information sharing.

4. feature development, feature discussion.
- Discussion of new features or updates to the platform.
- Discussion points around specific features of the tool, including both existing features and those planned for future updates.

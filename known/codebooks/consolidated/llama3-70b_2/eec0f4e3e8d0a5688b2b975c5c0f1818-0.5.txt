You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

21.
Label: outlining development roadmap
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

22.
Label: building relationships with users
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

23.
Label: share teaching experience
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

24.
Label: indicate receptiveness
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm.

25.
Label: designer 1 compares feature complexity
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

26.
Label: demonstrating courtesy
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

27.
Label: plan future user engagement
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

1.
Label: suspects ai bug
Quotes:
- E04: maybe you saw something that I didn't, but from my perspective, it seemed as though the code was set up appropriately, but it was marking the syntax as wrong. So maybe I was missing something, but I didn't see anything missing. So that was kind of frustrating. (interviewer's observation) Shows error messages even when it seems to be correct (that's a bug identified)
- E04: It seems like a bug because I feel like all my parentheses are closed and all of my arguments and syntax are correct. (interviewer's observation) A less-clear error message makes E04 stuck.

2.
Label: ai as a memory aid
Quotes:
- E04: Because I'll like forget the syntax sometimes and I usually use the netlogo dictionary and just have it like open to the side. (interviewer's observation) E04 still forgets about the syntax and ChatGPT can help.

3.
Label: acknowledges ai's mistake but sees value
Quotes:
- E01: The problem I posted was about 100 pages of NetLogo and then 100 pages, 100 lines of NetLogo. And it was a real problem that I had looked at. I would love to help this person, but this is going to take me minimum of two hours to figure out what are they trying to do? (interviewer's observation) Although AI made mistake, E01 still believes in the value in having an AI-generated solution (compared with no solution or no help).

4.
Label: frustrated by ambiguous errors
Quotes:
- E04: It seems like a bug because I feel like all my parentheses are closed and all of my arguments and syntax are correct. (interviewer's observation) A less-clear error message makes E04 stuck.

5.
Label: applies ai for specific model aspects
Quotes:
- E04: I use it a lot for developing like, equations for specific like, aspects of agent-based models that I create. (interviewer's observation) Helpful for creating equations

6.
Label: feed loop
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

7.
Label: chat gpt as an outside observer
Quotes:
- E01: I don't know how much it understands about all of the efficiencies of NetLogo... But it (could) catch obvious errors that are not obvious to me. Even if it's relatively dumb, it's an outside observer, which is great. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could serve as an outside observer that points out errors human did not realize.

8.
Label: experiencing frustration with stuck ai
Quotes:
- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.

9.
Label: supports pair programming for enhanced efficiency in problem solving
Quotes:
- E01: I'm an advocate of peer programming. It's about 10 times more efficient than single programming... If a person's programming, if you're programming it by yourself and you come to something you don't understand, you could spend a long time at that stoplight. (interviewer's observation) E01's positive opinions on peer programming with a hint that AI could play the role.

10.
Label: identifies "scope" as a learning challenge
Quotes:
- E01: And I find what I have trouble with and certainly what beginners have trouble with is "scope".   You know, when you go from one point to another and all of a sudden you're, you're not no longer in ask turtles to do something you're in, ask links to do. But you know, so all of a sudden you've shifted, you've shifted your variable space and this happens implicitly and all of a sudden you're writing code and then it gives you an error that of the nature X Y Z doesn't operate in a turtle context. (interviewer's observation) AI needs to support learning of the "scope" concept in NetLogo.

11.
Label: envisioning active dialogue with ai
Quotes:
- E01: What if you were just sitting in a peer programming and sitting next to a, uh, a bright person who was helping you, what would you want them to do? So you might start writing a line of code and they would stop and go, why are you, why are you typing? (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how AI could potentially serve as a pair programmer that questions the learners' motives.

12.
Label: limited experience with newer versions
Quotes:
- E04: I don't know if I've ever tried 4. I guess it would be 3.5. (interviewer's observation) Only used ChatGPT 3.5 before

13.

17.
Label: describes potential ai support in seeking help
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.

18.
Label: values chat gpt's suggestions for code improvement
Quotes:
- E01: So if I'm writing long NetLogo code now, I'd probably have ChatGPT just open on the side. And I write a block of code and then I handed ChatGPT. Say, could I have done this better? And it would go, yeah, you could rearrange this like that. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could help E01 optimize his code.

19.
Label: and the advantages of plain
Quotes:
- E01: You know, so in point of fact, I considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can. So that when I come back to it later, I could figure out why it, why it's not working anymore. (interviewer's observation) Discussion on code complexity & quality. Plain / not-tricky code's advantage in maintenance.

20.
Label: suggests ai could preserve fragmented knowledge
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.
- E01: So my observation is that a critical, critical 10%, maybe more, maybe a lot more of knowledge that you need to do your job in software is only contained in oral tradition. It's, it is not documented anywhere.  (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on knowledge in pieces - how they are generated and sustained.

21.
Label: values clear documentation
Quotes:
- E01: You know, so in point of fact, I considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can.

23.
Label: appreciates context understanding
Quotes:
- E01: Well, I cut the entire user's question. It figured out what I wanted. I didn't even tell it what I wanted. It just told me. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could infer E01's need from the input context.

24.
Label: practice
Quotes:
- E04: I just like being able to kind of, like, iteratively build it. The thing that I always do when I create a model is I do, like, the initial command. I'll set up and go here. I'll go ahead and after I kind of set up the buttons, I'll put the functions behind them back here in the interface. (interviewer's observation) E04 creates the code skeleton before asking ChatGPT. He has a clear idea & established process of building ABMs.
- E01: I don't want chat GPT to write 27 operations in one line and show how brilliant it is. I wanted to separate out the code and, and it did a good job of not only did it write the code, but it commented the code. And then in addition to commenting the code externally, it did documentation. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT tends to provide comments and documentation. Generated code is easy to read.
- E04: It's basically following best practices. It is not trying to ruthlessly create a model. (interviewer's observation) Not "ruthlessly create a model".

25.
Label: to save future costs
Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

26.
Label: compares ai suggestions to early navigation apps' inaccuracies
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

27.
Label: compares ai to other resources
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

28.
Label: highlights task specification
Quotes:
- E01: "please write a netlogo program that produces a checker board with black and white squares?" (interviewer's observation) E01 asks ChatLogo to create a checkerboard pattern.

(interviewer's observation) E01 reads the code and comments, summarizing the code, and thinks about how the AI was understanding the request.

31.
Label: recognizes beginner friendly features
Quotes:
- E04: It includes debugging, it is actually trying to incorporate like a unit test, which is really cool and really helpful, especially for beginners, because they can kind of, you know, check their inputs. Beginners, everyone really. They can debug their code appropriately. (interviewer's observation) Debugging capability.

32.
Label: personification
Quotes:
- E01: I speak to (ChatGPT) like a person. I could just walk in the room and go write me code that does X, but I don't, I start with good morning. And it comes back, but it comes back with good morning. How can I assist you today? It's pretty good at figuring out natural language. So in some sense that you might just be better off, just pretend it's not a computer. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how he interacts with ChatGPT like a person.

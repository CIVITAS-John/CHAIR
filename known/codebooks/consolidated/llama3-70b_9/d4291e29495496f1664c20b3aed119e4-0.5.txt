You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: describing plans for a simulated experiment assessment feature

2.
Label: agree with focus
Quotes:
- User: Indeed

3.
Label: explain functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

4.

Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

27.
Label: justifying focus on foundational features
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

31.
Label: user 4235 engages in participatory design
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

32.
Label: indicating phased approach to feature implementation
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

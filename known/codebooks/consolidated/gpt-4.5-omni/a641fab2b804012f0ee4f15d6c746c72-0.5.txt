You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Label: component update
Quotes:
- New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
- From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

Label: user suggestion
Quotes:
- It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- Okay. Please give more suggestions!
- Group sharing.

4.
Label: user feedback
Quotes:
- This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

5.
Label: usability improvement
Quotes:
- If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

Quotes:
- v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
More realistic 3D appearance for various meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeter and meter zeroing.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments
Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal/realistic modes.

# Special Tips
The Esc shortcut key will now minimize the window.
The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.
- This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
10. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P5: I need logic gates for making a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
Preliminary tags: project goal; alternative approach
2. P6: [Image 14]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
3. P6: [Image 15]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
4. P7: How to play?
Preliminary tags: gameplay inquiry; seeking information
5. Designer: Play by conducting experiments.233
Preliminary tags: experimental approach; gamified learning
6. P8: Why suddenly add a wave?
Preliminary tags: questioning; seeking clarification
7. P7: Oh, I see.
8. P2: [Image 20]

Thoughts: To analyze how Physics Lab's online community emerged, I will look for tags related to community building, user interactions, shared goals/interests, and the evolution of the platform itself. I'll identify tags that capture the dynamics of this conversation and how users are engaging with each other and the platform.

Tags for each message:
1. project goal; alternative approach; seeking tools
2. visual aid; sharing resources
3. visual aid; sharing resources  
4. new user; seeking guidance
5. experimental approach; gamified learning; instructional response
6. questioning features; seeking clarification  
7. understanding gameplay
8. visual aid; sharing progress
9. visual aid; sharing progress
10. demonstrating understanding

Summary: The conversation starts with a user (P5) looking for logic gates to build a calculator, but not wanting to use Minecraft. P6 shares some images, possibly related to the calculator project. A new user (P7) asks how to play, and the Designer explains the experimental, gamified approach. P8 questions the addition of a wave feature. P7 seems to understand the gameplay after the Designer's explanation. P2 shares images of their progress. Finally, P7 demonstrates their understanding by providing an answer (66).

Notes: 
- Users are working on projects (like calculators) and seeking tools/resources
- Images are being shared, likely to illustrate progress or ask questions
- New users are joining and seeking guidance on how to use the platform
- The Designer is actively engaged, explaining the experimental/gamified learning approach
- Users are questioning new features, seeking clarification
- Progress is being shared through images and answers, demonstrating understanding
- A small community seems to be forming around shared interests in physics experiments/simulations

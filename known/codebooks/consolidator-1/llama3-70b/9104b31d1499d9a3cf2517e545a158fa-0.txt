You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging? 
Yes, categories 8, 15, 23, and 32 seem to be standalone and could be merged with other categories. For example, category 8 (community governance models) could be merged with Community Development.

- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
Category 28 (social dynamics analysis) has 19 codes and might be too broad. It could be split into smaller categories, such as Social Interactions and Social Network Analysis.

- Is any naming inaccurate?
The naming seems accurate, but some category names could be more concise. For example, "Community Development" could be shortened to "Community".

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (32 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

Label: answer a concern
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

3.
Label: explanation of upcoming features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

4.
Label: share positive classroom experience

12.
Label: user 4230 contributes to content development
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

13.
Label: discuss design implications
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

14.
Label: designer 2 engages in problem solving
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

15.
Label: user 4235 reiterates need for manual

- User: Need the user manual for this software

16.
Label: communicated ongoing optimization
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

17.
Label: indicated need for guidance
Quotes:
- User: Is there a user manual?

18.
Label: confirming teacher identity
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

Label: share development plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

22.
Label: set development scope
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

23.
Label: give examples of feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

24.
Label: provided access to new features
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

25.
Label: identity inquiry

26.
Label: shared personal experience
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

27.
Label: indicate potential user needs
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

28.
Label: provide insight into user interaction

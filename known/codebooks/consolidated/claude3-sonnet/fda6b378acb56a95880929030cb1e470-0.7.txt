You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* software functionality 
* software design
* user interface design
* feature development
=> User Interface & Features

* user experience
* learning affordances  
* user interactions
=> User Experience & Learning  

* educational setting
=> Educational Context

* technical infrastructure
* technical requirements
* technical implementation 
* platform development
=> Technical Infrastructure & Requirements

* development process
* product development
=> Development Processes  

* community engagement

# Reflection
- The categories seem reasonably merged without creating overly large categories.
- The naming looks accurate and concise while covering the key aspects.
- One potential additional merging could be:
    * Development Processes
    * Design Process
    => Product & Design Processes

# Final Merging 
* User Interface & Features
* User Experience & Learning
* Educational Context  
* Technical Infrastructure & Requirements
* Product & Design Processes
* Community Engagement & Roles

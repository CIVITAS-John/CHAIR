You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

11.
Label: confirm professional role
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

12.
Label: expressed educational need
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

13.
Label: explore accessibility considerations for diverse users
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

- User: Excuse me.

15.
Label: user 4230 suggests features for mechanical waves and vibrations
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

16.
Label: greet community

22.
Label: confirm professional identity
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

23.
Label: plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

24.
Label: indicated successful navigation
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

25.
Label: designer 1 provides detailed response
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa

26.
Label: user 4232 suggests refinement
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

27.
Label: identify areas for improvement
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

28.
Label: propose future considerations
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

29.
Label: build user trust
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- Designer: We are working on this part

30.
Label: promised feature addition
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

31.
Label: new feature
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

32.
Label: updated on ios status
Quotes:
- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

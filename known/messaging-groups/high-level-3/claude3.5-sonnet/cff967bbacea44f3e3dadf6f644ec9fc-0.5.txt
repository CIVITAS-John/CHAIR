You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

* Summary
This conversation involves designers and users discussing the Physics Lab software, focusing on compatibility issues, updates, and user feedback. The designers are addressing concerns about system compatibility, particularly with older operating systems like XP, and announcing updates to the software. Users are providing positive feedback and asking questions about usage.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we'll focus on themes related to software development, user interaction, and community building. We'll examine how the designers respond to user feedback, how they communicate updates, and how users engage with the software and the community. We'll also look at the iterative nature of software development and how it relates to user needs. Key questions to consider: How do designers balance user needs with technical constraints? How does user feedback influence software development? How do designers foster a sense of community among users?

# Software Development Process
## Iterating based on user feedback
Definition: Designers making changes or improvements to the software based on user input or experiences
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate)."
- "XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine."
- "Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:"

## Addressing compatibility issues
Definition: Designers working to ensure the software functions across different operating systems and hardware
- "It does not support the XP system."
- "Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards)."
- "XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine."

# User Engagement
## Seeking clarification
Definition: Users asking questions to better understand how to use the software
- "How do you use the PC version?"
- "Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old."
- "Win7 should be fine."

## Providing positive feedback
Definition: Users expressing satisfaction or appreciation for the software
- "This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use."
- "Thank you."

# Community Building
## Encouraging open communication
Definition: Designers promoting an environment where users feel comfortable sharing their experiences and problems
- "No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group."

## Announcing updates
Definition: Designers informing the community about new versions or changes to the software

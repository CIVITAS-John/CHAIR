You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (32 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
32. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P13: From freshman year in high school.
Preliminary tags: educational timeline; academic progress
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
Preliminary tags: technical inquiry; semiconductor devices; electronics knowledge
3. P2: @Designer 
Preliminary tags: user interaction; direct addressing; community engagement
4. P17: [Image 198]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used with test tubes?
Preliminary tags: chemical experiments; laboratory equipment; substance usage
6. P2: +1
Preliminary tags: affirmation; agreement; positive feedback
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 202]
9. P14: How do you say?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Will the condensed liquid not flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year...
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be on electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
32. P1: If you can create a comprehensive and free software, it should be very popular.

Thoughts: In analyzing the conversation from the learning sciences perspective, consider how participants engage with educational content, share knowledge, and support each other's learning. From the human-computer interaction viewpoint, focus on the ways users interact with the platform, including direct addressing of the designer and the use of images. Finally, through the lens of participatory design, explore how users contribute to the development of the platform and the designer's responses to user suggestions and needs.

Summary: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community covers a wide range of topics, from technical inquiries about semiconductor devices and superconductors to discussions on chemical experiments and laboratory equipment. Users engage with each other, provide feedback to the designer, and share images to support their communication. The designer addresses user concerns, emphasizes exam-focused learning, and discusses the development of educational software. Participants also touch upon the challenges of simulating complex experiments and express interest in comprehensive, free software solutions.

Notes: The community seems actively involved in discussing both theoretical concepts and practical aspects of physics and chemistry experiments. The designer's focus on exam preparation and software development reflects a user-centered approach to platform design. There is a mix of technical discussions, user engagement, and suggestions for improving educational resources, indicating a collaborative and participatory environment within the community.

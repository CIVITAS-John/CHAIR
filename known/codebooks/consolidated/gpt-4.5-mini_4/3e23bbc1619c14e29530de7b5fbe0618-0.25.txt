You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: appreciate ai's error detection, acknowledges ai's value despite mistakes
- Interviewees acknowledge the AI's ability to identify errors that may not be obvious and appreciate the AI's ability to clarify error messages.
- Interviewees express appreciation for AI-generated solutions despite occasional mistakes, valuing the assistance it provides.

2.
Concepts: recognize importance of effective ai use, emphasize iterative questioning
- Users recognize that effective use of AI requires skill in formulating iterative questions.
- Users recognize the importance of iterative questioning in their interactions with AI and emphasize the need for iterative questioning to maximize AI's output.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. 
Concepts: appreciate ai's error detection, acknowledges ai's value despite mistakes
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both reflect a positive perception of AI's capabilities, highlighting both its strengths in error detection and the value users find in its assistance, even when it makes mistakes.
Criteria: Interviewees appreciate the AI's ability to detect errors and clarify messages while acknowledging its overall value despite occasional inaccuracies.
Phrase: Value AI's error detection and assistance

2. 
Concepts: recognize importance of effective ai use, emphasize iterative questioning
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as they both focus on the necessity of skillful interaction with AI, particularly through the practice of iterative questioning to enhance the effectiveness of AI outputs.
Criteria: Users recognize the need for effective AI use and emphasize the importance of formulating iterative questions to improve interactions with the AI.
Phrase: Emphasize iterative questioning for effective AI use

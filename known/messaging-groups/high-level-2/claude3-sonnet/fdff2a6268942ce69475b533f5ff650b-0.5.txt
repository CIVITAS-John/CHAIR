96. P2: What if it burns?
97. P4: Just power it on and play a rotating animation, that's it üòÇ
98. P2: Do we still need algorithms?
99. P4: üòÇ Simple and done.

102. P13: [Image 175]
103. P13: Are you all fake?
104. P13: Are you from outer space?
105. P13: I don't understand.
106. P2: Transistors can also be used.
107. Designer: You can make some interesting components, but normal experiments shouldn't be done like this...
108. P11: üòÇ That's in electronic circuits.
109. P11: I don't understand either.
110. P2: It's in the CPU.
111. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned some when I took an optional course in circuits.
112. P2: Add a capacitive divider.
113. P2: I learned it by myself.
114. P11: That's great, especially if you have a hobby in it.
115. P14: @P11 Are there still distinctions between arts and sciences now?
116. P2: no
117. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
118. P14: [Image 191]
119. P14: ...Let me pass the exam first.
120. P2: I'm still in the second year of junior high school.
121. P11: Keep it up.
122. P13: From freshman year in high school.
123. P2: What about MOSFETs?
124. P2: @Designer 
125. P17: [Image 198]
126. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used with test tubes?
127. P2: +1

*Summary*

The conversation revolves around a physics simulation software or app being developed by the group. Members discuss various features and components that could be included, such as celestial bodies, motors, electronic circuits, and more. There are also some off-topic conversations about personal backgrounds and experiences.

*Plan*

To analyze this conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can look for evidence of:

1. Knowledge sharing and co-construction among community members
2. User needs, requirements, and feedback for the software/app
3. Collaborative design process and decision making
4. Socio-technical interactions and dynamics within the online community

We can categorize the codes under broad themes like Community Knowledge Building, User-Centered Design, Collaborative Design Process, and Community Dynamics.

Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Thought: The input quotes suggest that the Physics Lab online community is focused on developing tools and features to support creating and visualizing circuit diagrams, particularly for educational purposes like exams and textbooks. The key themes are the need for convenient diagramming tools, the ability to convert between physical and circuit diagrams, and consulting with teachers to understand their requirements.
Phrase: Developing circuit diagramming tools for education

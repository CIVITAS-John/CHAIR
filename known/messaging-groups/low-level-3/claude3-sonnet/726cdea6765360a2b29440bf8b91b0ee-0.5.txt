1. P4233: May I ask?
Preliminary tags: clarification request; information seeking
2. P8: Group sharing.
Preliminary tags: content sharing; community interaction
3. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
Preliminary tags: download instructions; software access
4. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
Preliminary tags: feature updates; product roadmap; community feedback; development plans
5. P4234: [Emoji 56]
Preliminary tags: emoji
6. P4232: [Emoji 57][Emoji 57]
Preliminary tags: emoji expression; community interaction
7. P4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer: Hello :)
9. P4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer: [Image 61] Updates in progress
11. Designer: This one is more complicated, so it will take some more time... Hopefully it will be ready for release this week
12. Designer: There will be: multimeter; energized screw tube; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem solving and middle school teaching)
13. P4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer: Have you encountered any problems during your use?
15. Designer: We try to design it to be usable without additional instructions, or we will provide some tips when you first open it based on feedback
16. P4235: Mainly for schools to build information technology schools
17. P4235: Need a user manual for this software
18. Designer: Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?
19. P4232: This is great, hoping it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams. Also, it would be great to have a function to hide the background grid with one click, making it easier for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no convenient software for drawing circuit diagrams for circuit-related questions.
20. Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later
22. P4235: You can also include mechanics experiments
23. Designer: For example, after connecting the physical diagram, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics is figured out; it will take some time
25. P4232: Oh, that's good
26. Designer: I hope to figure out electromagnetics before the end of the year
27. P4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do exercises in the application
29. P4234: It's starting to take shape [Emoji 80]
30. Designer: For example, connecting the circuit diagram to see the physical diagram, or vice versa
31. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer: Hmm.
33. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
34. P4232: Indeed
35. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
36. Designer: I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
37. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
38. P4232: This is a really good idea
39. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
40. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?
[Image 91]
41. Designer: [Image 92]This one.
42. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.

Thoughts: This conversation seems to be discussing the development and features of an educational physics simulation software called Physics Lab. The designer is soliciting feedback and suggestions from the community members, who appear to be teachers or educators interested in using the software. Key topics include updates to the software, potential new features like circuit diagram editing and conversion, support for different physics topics like mechanics and chemistry, and usability considerations like user manuals. To analyze the emergence of this online community, I will look for tags related to community interaction, feedback sharing, feature requests, and the designer's responsiveness to user needs.

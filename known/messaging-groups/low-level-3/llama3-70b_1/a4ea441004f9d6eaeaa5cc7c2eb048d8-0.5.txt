You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. P4232: Thank you.
Preliminary tags: gratitude expression
2. P8: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary tags: community norms; feedback encouragement
3. P4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary tags: software evaluation; usability; practicality
4. Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary tags: technical issue; xp compatibility; virtual machine
5. Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary tags: technical issue; compatibility explanation; system requirements
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary tags: version update; community notification; file sharing
7. Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. P4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. P8: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. P4232: @Designer Yes, yes.
15. P4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer: There will be.
17. Designer: Does the class have internet?
18. P4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

Thoughts: 
For this conversation, I'll focus on identifying the emergence of the online community around Physics Lab, exploring how the designer and users interact, share feedback, and shape the development of the software. I'll examine the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions: How do users provide feedback, and how does the designer respond? What are the community norms and expectations? How does the designer's role evolve throughout the conversation?

Summary:
The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community, where users provide feedback and suggestions, and the designer responds with updates, explanations, and future plans. The community norms are established, encouraging users to share their thoughts and opinions. The designer is responsive, addressing technical issues, and incorporating user feedback into the development roadmap.

Notes:
The conversation highlights the participatory design approach, where users and the designer collaborate to shape the software. The designer's role is not only to develop the software but also to engage with the community, provide explanations, and incorporate feedback. The community's expectations and needs are being shaped through this conversation, influencing the development of Physics Lab.

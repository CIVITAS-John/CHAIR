You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify low-level tags of each message.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
3. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. P4231: [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
6. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
7. Designer: [Image]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

Thoughts: The conversation seems to be about the development of Physics Lab, an educational software or platform. The messages discuss the prioritization of different physics topics, the need for more opinions before starting mechanics, and the upcoming changes to the software. I will focus on identifying the low-level tags related to the social interactions and community dynamics.

Messages:
1. P4230: Respect, Request|Skipped
2. Designer: Prioritization, Sequencing
3. Designer: Gathering opinions, Caution
4. P4230: Appreciation
5. P4231: Inquiry, Information seeking
6. P4231: Gratitude
7. Designer: Announcement
8. Designer: Announcement

Summary: The conversation shows the emergence of an online community around the development of Physics Lab. The community members engage in discussions about the prioritization of topics, the need for gathering more opinions, and the appreciation for the work being done. The designers also make announcements about upcoming changes to the software.

Notes: The conversation demonstrates the collaborative nature of the community, with members making requests, providing feedback, and expressing gratitude. The designers seem to be responsive to the community's needs and are open to gathering more opinions before proceeding with certain developments. This suggests a community-driven approach to the development of Physics Lab.

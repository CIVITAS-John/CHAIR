You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: designer 1 offers to provide content
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

2.
Label: designer 1 informs about new version
Quotes:
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group

3.
Label: communicated procedural details
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first
- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

4.
Label: describe outdated technology
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

5.
Label: user 4230 makes a request
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

6.
Label: designer 1 considers multiple options
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

7.
Label: specify hardware requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

8.
Label: further question
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

9.
Label: sought technical guidance
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

10.
Label: encourage feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

11.
Label: request user manual
Quotes:
- User: Is there a user manual?

12.
Label: politeness
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
- Designer: Hello :)
- User: Excuse me.

13.
Label: technical issue
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

14.
Label: identify user role
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

15.
Label: feature request
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request.

Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

16.
Label: ask a question about how to use
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

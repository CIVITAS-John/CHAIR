You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: sharing user experience
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

2.
Label: describing plans for a simulated experiment assessment feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

3.
Label: appreciates 3d effect
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

4.
Label: clarify existing feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

5.
Label: shows interest in accessibility
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

6.
Label: clarifying on screen keyboard behavior
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

7.
Label: acknowledging the ongoing work on this part
Quotes:
- Designer: We are working on this part

8.
Label: proposing collaboration
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- Designer: Group sharing.

9.
Label: response to question
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?
- User: Left side

10.
Label: enhancing educational value of simulations
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

11.
Label: suggesting alternative system
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

12.
Label: accepting suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

13.
Label: reason for suggestion
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

14.
Label: justifies design decision
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

15.
Label: explains lack of internet in class due to previous incident
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

16.
Label: share past incident
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

17.
Label: shares research goals
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

18.
Label: adapting to user constraints
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

19.
Label: explaining design goals
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

20.
Label: contributing to product development
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

21.
Label: sets development goal
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

22.
Label: suggests using the right side for non crossing in circuit diagrams
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

23.
Label: outlines development plans
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

24.
Label: encourages critical thinking
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

10.
Label: demonstrating user expertise
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

11.
Label: paying respect
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

12.
Label: looking for pc version tutorials
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

13.
Label: resource request
Quotes:

16.
Label: encouraging user input
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

17.
Label: offers personalized support
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

18.
Label: considering usefulness and usability
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

19.
Label: self-solved
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

20.
Label: appreciation of features
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

21.
Label: seeking confirmation on design choices
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

22.
Label: identifying user's platform
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

23.
Label: recognizes need for local export
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

Label: praises software's simulation effect in class
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

25.
Label: shares personal interest
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

26.
Label: identifying oneself
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

27.
Label: inquiring about documentation
Quotes:
- User: Is there a user manual?

28.
Label: speculate on compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

29.
Label: promising implementation
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: There will be.

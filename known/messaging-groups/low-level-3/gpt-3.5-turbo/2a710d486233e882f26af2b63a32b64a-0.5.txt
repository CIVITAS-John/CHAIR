You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer: Done.
Preliminary tags: task completion; designer's action
2. P5: Good ðŸ˜‚
Preliminary tags: positive feedback
3. P8: @Designer  we need an admin here.
Preliminary tags: request for admin; interaction with designer
4. P13: Are all the members in this group top students?
Preliminary tags: community demographics; inquiry
5. P14: Except me.
Preliminary tags: self deprecation
6. P13: ï¼‹1
Preliminary tags: agreement with previous statement
7. P15: Plus one more.
8. P16: ï¼‹1
9. P10: May I ask what does "+1" mean?
10. P11: It means "me too".

Thoughts: When analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, consider the social dynamics within the community (learning sciences), the interactions between participants and the platform (human-computer interaction), and how the community's needs and features evolve over time (participatory design).

Tags for each message:
1. Task completion; designer's action; platform development
2. Positive feedback; community engagement
3. Request for admin; interaction with designer; community management
4. Community demographics; inquiry; inclusivity
5. Self-deprecation; community dynamics
6. Agreement with previous statement; community engagement
7. Community participation; agreement with previous statements
8. Community engagement; agreement with previous statements
9. Inquiry; seeking clarification; community norms
10. Explanation; community norms; engagement

Summary: The conversation includes interactions related to task completion and platform development, positive feedback, requests for admin support, inquiries about community demographics and norms, self-deprecation, and explanations of community norms. The designer is actively engaged in responding to requests and clarifications, while community members participate in discussions and support each other.

Notes: The community seems to be diverse in terms of skills and backgrounds, with members actively engaging with each other and seeking clarification on community norms. The designer plays a crucial role in managing the community and responding to their needs. The dynamics of self-deprecation and inclusivity are also evident in the conversation.

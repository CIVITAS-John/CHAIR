1. 大家好～开发计划、PC 下载地址都在群公告里
---
2. 如果有什么建议和需求欢迎提出来
---
3. 先膜拜一下大神，再提一点小需求。能不能做机械波机械振动的动态演示，例如横波纵波的传播，波的叠加，波的衍射、干涉。还有光学的实验，很希望有光具座、单缝、双缝、偏振片啊这种，可以演示光学实验～
---
4. 嗯……我们应该会优先完成电学，然后是磁学，然后是其他部分【
---
5. 开始力学之前会再集中征求意见～不然怕自己记不住
---
6. 好的好的～辛苦辛苦了

7. [Emoji]大家好，请问PC / 交互式电子白板版本的Physics Lab在哪里可以下载到呢
---
8. 看到群文件了，谢谢
===
1. Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are both in the group announcement.
---
2. If you have any suggestions or needs, feel free to bring them up.
---
3. First, let's pay tribute to the experts, then I have a small request. Can you make a dynamic demonstration of mechanical wave and mechanical vibration, such as the propagation of transverse waves and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, I really hope to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, polarizers, etc., to demonstrate optical experiments~

4. Hmm... We should prioritize completing the electricity section first, then move on to magnetism, and then other parts.
---
5. Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember.
---
6. Okay okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

7. [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?

8. I saw the files in the group, thank you.

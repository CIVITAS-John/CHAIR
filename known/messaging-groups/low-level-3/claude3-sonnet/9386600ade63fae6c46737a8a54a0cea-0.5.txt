You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (5 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
5. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P8: [Image 0]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

Thoughts: To analyze how Physics Lab's online community emerged, I should look for tags related to community building, user roles and interactions, motivations for participation, and the evolution of the platform itself. Some potential tags could relate to image sharing features, user roles (e.g. teacher, developer), and questions about functionality.

Tags for each message (5 in total):
1. image-sharing; watermark; upload-features
2. developer-response; feature-request 
3. user-role; teacher; clarifying-question
4. image-sharing; user-role-inquiry
5. user-role; teacher; confirmation

Summary: The conversation begins with a user (P8) sharing an image. The designer then asks how to upload a high-resolution image without a watermark, suggesting a desire for improved image sharing capabilities. Another user (P4229) asks if this request is for the PC version, indicating they may be a teacher using the platform. The designer confirms they want to upload an image and asks if P4229 is a teacher, to which P4229 confirms they are. This suggests an active community with different user roles like teachers and developers, discussing platform features and improvements.

Notes: The initial conversation hints at an emerging online community around Physics Lab, with users in different roles (teachers, developers) interacting and discussing platform features like image sharing. There seems to be interest from teachers in using the platform effectively, while the developer is responsive to user needs and feedback. Improving capabilities like high-res image uploads could facilitate better use cases like sharing lesson materials.

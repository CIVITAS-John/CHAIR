You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (19 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
19. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: proposing simulated experiment assessment; enhancing experimental details
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: praising innovative idea
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: promising consultation; ensuring community involvement
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: seeking teacher input; querying textbook conventions
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: soliciting confirmation; verifying circuit diagram style
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirming commonality; identifying prevalent circuit diagram style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on capturing the essence of each message, paying attention to the designer's proposals, users' reactions, and the context of the conversation. I'll explore how the designer engages with the community, seeks feedback, and shares updates. From a learning sciences perspective, I'll look for instances of participatory design and co-creation. From an HCI perspective, I'll examine how the designer communicates about the development process and elicits user input. 

Interpretations for each message:
1. Designer-1: proposing simulated experiment assessment; enhancing experimental details
2. User-4232: praising innovative idea; expressing enthusiasm
3. Designer-1: promising consultation; ensuring community involvement; building trust
4. Designer-1: seeking teacher input; querying textbook conventions; exploring educational standards
5. Designer-1: soliciting confirmation; verifying circuit diagram style; ensuring accuracy
6. User-4234: confirming commonality; identifying prevalent circuit diagram style; sharing knowledge
7. Designer-1: seeking clarification; asking for user opinion
8. Designer-1: indicating work in progress; setting expectations
9. User-4234: providing opinion; participating in design decision
10. Designer-1: acknowledging user input; responding to feedback
11. Designer-1: simplifying design; improving user experience
12. User-4234: offering alternative perspective; suggesting design improvement
13. Designer-1: considering multiple options; weighing design trade-offs
14. Designer-1: explaining development process; managing user expectations; providing context
15. Designer-1: sharing visual prototype; soliciting feedback
16. Designer-1: expressing gratitude; acknowledging community support
17. User-4234: inquiring about update schedule; seeking project timeline
18. Designer-1: providing update timeline; setting release expectations
19. Designer-1: highlighting update significance; preparing users for changes

Summary: The conversation begins with the designer proposing a new feature for simulated experiment assessment and seeking input from the community. The designer engages with users, asking for opinions and feedback on circuit diagram styles, and shares updates on the development process. Users respond with enthusiasm, provide insights, and offer suggestions, demonstrating a sense of participation and co-creation.

Notes: The designer's language suggests a commitment to community involvement and participatory design. The use of images and requests for feedback creates a sense of transparency and openness. The conversation highlights the importance of understanding educational standards and user needs in the design process. I'll continue to explore these themes in subsequent rounds of coding.

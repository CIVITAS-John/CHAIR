You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

12.
Label: maintain community interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

13.
Label: designer 1 aligns with educational needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

14.
Label: indicated openness to future chemistry experiments
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

15.
Label: highlighted convenience
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

16.
Label: evaluating software usability
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

17.
Label: communicated project timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

18.
Label: aims to finalize electromagnetism understanding by year end
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

19.
Label: detail reasons for network restrictions
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

20.
Label: user 4234 engages with designers
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

21.
Label: showing empathy
Quotes:

- Designer: Hmm hmm.

22.
Label: researching innovative features
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

23.
Label: pointed out practical need
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

24.
Label: teaching
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

25.
Label: hinted at future possibilities
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

26.

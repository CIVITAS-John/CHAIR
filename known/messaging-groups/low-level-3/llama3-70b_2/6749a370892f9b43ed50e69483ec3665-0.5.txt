You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary tags: workaround; browser trick
2. P4232: @Designer Yes, yes.
Preliminary tags: agreement; confirmation
3. P4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary tags: feature request; export function; save experiment; import experiment
4. Designer: There will be.
Preliminary tags: designer response; future development
5. Designer: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary tags: internet access; classroom setting
6. P4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary tags: internet restriction; classroom computer; school policy
7. Designer: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. P4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer: Hmm hmm.
11. P4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. P4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. P4233: How to download?
17. P4233: Excuse me.
18. P8: Group sharing.

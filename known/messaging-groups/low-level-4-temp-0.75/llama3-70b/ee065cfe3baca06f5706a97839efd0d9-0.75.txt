You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary phrases: announcing updates; revising simulation features; enhancing realism
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary phrases: introducing new features; explaining functionality; enhancing user experience
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary phrases: soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; fostering collaboration
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary phrases: seeking technical guidance; expressing confusion; seeking support
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary phrases: providing technical information; addressing limitations; managing expectations
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

Summary: This conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community, where designers engage with users to discuss updates, features, and technical issues. The designers actively solicit feedback, provide technical support, and manage expectations. Users share their experiences, ask questions, and offer suggestions, demonstrating a sense of collaboration and community. The conversation highlights the importance of user-centered design and the role of designers in facilitating a supportive online environment.

Notes: Some hypotheses emerging from this conversation are that the designers are committed to creating a user-friendly experience, encouraging open communication and collaboration. The users, in turn, seem to appreciate the designers' efforts and are willing to provide feedback and suggestions. The conversation also hints at the technical challenges of developing software compatible with various systems, which may be an area for further exploration.

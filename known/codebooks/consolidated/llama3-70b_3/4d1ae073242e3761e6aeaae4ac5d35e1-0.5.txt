1.
Label: recognizes chat gpt's intuitive responses
Quotes:
- E01: That's okay. Go is a convention. It's not really a requirement of the language that you use the word go. You can say banana to banana and have a button on the interface. It's a banana button. (interviewer's observation) E01 honors ChatGPT's own intuition even though it might be different from the convention.

2.
Label: reads and comments on code
Quotes:
- E01: So set up, move the turtle to go. Increase the size of the turtle by two units. Oh, dear. It's, it's making the turtle bigger. Oh, that's kind of, that's kind of messed it up a little bit then. (interviewer's observation) E01 reads the code and comments, summarizing the code, and thinks about how the AI was understanding the request.

3.
Label: express hope for continuous improvement
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

4.
Label: describes ai generated code working out of the box
Quotes:
- E01: I want to do this in visual basic... So I made a spreadsheet and I asked ChatGPT, how do you do this? And it wrote the code and the code worked out of the box. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT helped with a VBA task out of the box before.

5.
Label: summarizes ai generated code
Quotes:
- E01: So set up, move the turtle to go. Increase the size of the turtle by two units. Oh, dear. It's, it's making the turtle bigger. Oh, that's kind of, that's kind of messed it up a little bit then. (interviewer's observation) E01 reads the code and comments, summarizing the code, and thinks about how the AI was understanding the request.

6.
Label: suggests realistic approach
Quotes:
- E01: And, and they don't, this is an unfamiliar task to them apparently. So they want to ask one question and get the right answer the first time. And I, I don't have that expectation. I'll ask the right question and it'll get me 80% of the way there. (interviewer's observation) Novices might have a too high expectation for ChatGPT (but it cannot achieve that).

7.
Label: critique novices' code sharing practices
Quotes:
- E01: I couldn't (help the novice) because when a beginner just posts a big block of code, it says there's something wrong with this. (interviewer's observation) Challenges for novices to seek help: they simply post chunks of code without background information.

8.
Label: acknowledges lack of determinism in results
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

9.
Label: comments on ai's interpretation
Quotes:
- E01: So set up, move the turtle to go. Increase the size of the turtle by two units. Oh, dear. It's, it's making the turtle bigger. Oh, that's kind of, that's kind of messed it up a little bit then. (interviewer's observation) E01 reads the code and comments, summarizing the code, and thinks about how the AI was understanding the request.

10.
Label: question effectiveness of existing educational systems
Quotes:
- E01: Can it design a generic learning management path? Because a lot of people can develop systems, but they're not good teachers. (interviewer's observation) Hypothetically: maybe AI could be used for building learning pathways.

11.
Label: suggests ai encouraging early help seeking
Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

12.
Label: lack of consistency in output - not sure what to expect
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

13.
Label: acknowledges ai's tendency to hallucinate
Quotes:
- E01: So maybe the details are wrong and, you know, Michael Tamalo or somebody jumped on me because I posted some answer and it used some function that wasn't available. AI had hallucinated some function. (interviewer's observation) AI might hallucinates.

14.
Label: dislikes limited ai options
Quotes:
- E04: So, I guess that's kind of annoying because I didn't really want it to explain here, but that was the only option that I had. (interviewer's observation) E04 wants the "fix" option right after the errors are identified.

15.
Label: highlight the value of shared knowledge
Quotes:
- E01: I'm an advocate of peer programming. It's about 10 times more efficient than single programming... If a person's programming, if you're programming it by yourself and you come to something you don't understand, you could spend a long time at that stoplight. (interviewer's observation) E01's positive opinions on peer programming with a hint that AI could play the role.

16.
Label: sets clear expectations for ai assistance
Quotes:
- E01: So let's say "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square." (interviewer's observation) E01's first task.

17.
Label: identifies challenges novices face in seeking help
Quotes:
- E01: I couldn't (help the novice) because when a beginner just posts a big block of code, it says there's something wrong with this. (interviewer's observation) Challenges for novices to seek help: they simply post chunks of code without background information.

18.
Label: experiences occasional memory lapses
Quotes:
- E04: Because I'll like forget the syntax sometimes and I usually use the netlogo dictionary and just have it like open to the side. (interviewer's observation) E04 still forgets about the syntax and ChatGPT can help.

19.
Label: highlights ai's promptness
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

20.
Label: highlight the need for a help seeking culture
Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

21.
Label: adapts to ai limitations
Quotes:
- E04: So that's interesting anyways, I'm going back to Perceptron. (interviewer's observation) E04 gives up immediately after the AI asks the same question again.

22.
Label: critique net logo's lack of modern features
Quotes:
- E01: And I got to admit like these days, NetLogo is the only language I use that does not have a smart editor. It doesn't autocomplete it or give me options of these are five variables that begin with those three letters. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's lack of smart code editors (we have one in TU that he would later see).

23.
Label: appreciate efficiency of chat gpt
Quotes:
- E01: And I posted that into chat GPT and it analyzed it in 10 seconds and said, well, it does this, this, and this, and here, these eight things are wrong. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could be used to provide timely feedback.

24.
Label: reflects on coding conventions
Quotes:
- E01: That's okay. Go is a convention. It's not really a requirement of the language that you use the word go. You can say banana to banana and have a button on the interface. It's a banana button. (interviewer's observation) E01 honors ChatGPT's own intuition even though it might be different from the convention.

25.
Label: praises chat gpt's inference abilities
Quotes:
- E01: Well, I cut the entire user's question. It figured out what I wanted. I didn't even tell it what I wanted. It just told me. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could infer E01's need from the input context.

26.
Label: emphasize potential for streamlined communication
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.

27.
Label: criticizes current technical documentation
Quotes:
- E01: I cannot learn like that. I'm sorry. I am not a top left first page to last page. So if AI can help find a good place to start and manage that learning process, then I think that's astounding. (interviewer's observation) Critique on the existing situation of technical documentation and imagine that AI could improve the learning process.

28.
Label: advocates for improved error handling
Quotes:
- E04: maybe you saw something that I didn't, but from my perspective, it seemed as though the code was set up appropriately, but it was marking the syntax as wrong. So maybe I was missing something, but I didn't see anything missing. So that was kind of frustrating. (interviewer's observation) Shows error messages even when it seems to be correct (that's a bug identified)

29.
Label: implies thoroughness
Quotes:
- E01: "Also a good idea because we did not ask it to do that." (interviewer's observation) E01 reads and evaluates the ChatGPT code. Asks Interviewer to scroll slowly so he could read in detail.

30.
Label: adds detail
Quotes:
- E01: "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square, but the square should go larger each time it goes around." (interviewer's observation) Seeing AI's counter question, E01 makes his request more detailed.

31.
Label: prefers self debugging
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E04 manually tries to fix the errors in the AI-generated code and did not choose "explain it".

32.
Label: sets up initial commands and functions early
Quotes:
- E04: I just like being able to kind of, like, iteratively build it. The thing that I always do when I create a model is I do, like, the initial command. I'll set up and go here. I'll go ahead and after I kind of set up the buttons, I'll put the functions behind them back here in the interface. (interviewer's observation) E04 creates the code skeleton before asking ChatGPT. He has a clear idea & established process of building ABMs.

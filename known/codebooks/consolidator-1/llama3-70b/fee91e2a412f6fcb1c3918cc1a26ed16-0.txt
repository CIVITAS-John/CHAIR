You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* project off-topics
* social identity
=> peripheral interactions (small, less central interactions within the community)

* information exchange
* technical exchange
=> knowledge sharing (exchanging information and technical expertise)

* design facilitation
* tool design considerations
=> design considerations (facilitating design and considering tool design)

* community development
* social atmosphere
=> community dynamics (development and atmosphere of the community)

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging? 
Yes, categories 3 and 5 could be merged as they both relate to knowledge exchange and co-construction.

- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split? 
No, the merged categories seem to be well-defined and distinct.

- Is any naming inaccurate? 
No, the names of the merged categories accurately reflect the combined aspects.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* support and feedback
* cognitive process
* online interaction dynamics
* online community development
* physics and astronomy
* learning and education
* technical requirements
* user engagement
* design and interaction
* technical knowledge and practices
* learning and instruction
* sustainability and context

You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1. platform updates, user-centered design.
- The designer's communication about upcoming changes and improvements to the platform.
- The designer's approach to communicating new features and updates to the community.

2. designer responsiveness, community responsiveness.
- The designer demonstrates responsiveness to user needs and suggestions, and is open to incorporating feedback from the community into the design and development process.
- The designers or developers demonstrate responsiveness to the community's needs and feedback, and are committed to improving the tool based on the community's input.

3. community influence, collaborative improvement.
- The community's role in the software's evolution and their influence on the design process.
- Examples of the community members providing feedback and suggestions to enhance the software.

4. co-creation, community-driven experiment development.
- The level of collaboration and co-creation between the designer and the community in the development of the Physics Lab software.
- The extent to which the Physics Lab community is involved in the design and development of the software, including their contributions to the creation and refinement of physics experiments and demonstrations.

5. community engagement.
- The designer's efforts to understand and respond to the needs of the community members, as well as the level of engagement and participation from the community members in the development process.
- The role of education and teaching within the online community, as well as the ways in which the online community members support each other's learning and troubleshooting.

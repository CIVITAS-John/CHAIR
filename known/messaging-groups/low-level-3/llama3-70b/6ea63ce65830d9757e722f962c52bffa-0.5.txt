You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (15 in total):
1. {an interpretation of message 1}
...
15. {an interpretation of message 15}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary codes: designer 1 announces a change in the simulation; removing ideal components to increase realism; simulation design decision
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary codes: designer 1 introduces a new component; the student power supply; supporting dc and ac; simulation feature update
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary codes: designer 1 solicits feedback; encouraging user participation; community engagement
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary codes: user 4232 seeks guidance; technical inquiry; user's learning needs
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary codes: designer 2 provides technical information; system compatibility; limitation of the platform
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

Thoughts: In this first round of coding, I will focus on understanding the interactions between designers and users, identifying the design decisions and updates, and recognizing the needs and concerns of the users. I will explore the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Codes for each message:

1. Designer-1 announces a change in the simulation; removing ideal components to increase realism; simulation design decision
2. Designer 1 introduces a new component; the student power supply; supporting dc and ac; simulation feature update
3. Designer 1 solicits feedback; encouraging user participation; community engagement
4. User 4232 seeks guidance; technical inquiry; user's learning needs
5. Image sharing; user 4232 provides visual context
6. Designer 2 provides technical information; system compatibility; limitation of the platform
7. User 4232 shares context about school's computer system; old system limitations
8. User 4232 suggests Win7 as a compatible system
9. Designer 2 confirms Win7 compatibility
10. User 4232 expresses gratitude
11. Designer 2 encourages open feedback; community support
12. User 4232 provides positive feedback; software usability
13. Designer 1 considers XP compatibility; potential solution with virtual machine
14. Designer 1 provides theoretical compatibility information; system requirements
15. Designer 1 announces new version release; update notification

Summary: The conversation starts with Designer-1 announcing changes to the simulation and introducing a new component. The discussion then shifts to User-4232 seeking guidance on using the PC version, which leads to a conversation about system compatibility. Designer-2 provides technical information, and User-4232 shares context about their school's computer system. The conversation concludes with Designer-1 considering XP compatibility and announcing a new version release.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, soliciting feedback, and providing technical information to support user needs. The users are also actively participating, seeking guidance, and providing positive feedback. The conversation highlights the importance of system compatibility and the designers' efforts to ensure the platform's usability.

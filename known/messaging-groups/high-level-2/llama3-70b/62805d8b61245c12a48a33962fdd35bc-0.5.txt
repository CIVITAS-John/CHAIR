Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P8: [Image 0]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without watermark for this profile picture?
3. P4229: pc version?
4. Designer: Let me upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are both in the group announcement.
7. Designer: If you have any suggestions or needs, feel free to bring them up.
8. P4230: First, let's pay tribute to the experts, then I have a small request. Can you make a dynamic demonstration of mechanical wave and mechanical vibration, such as the propagation of transverse waves and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, I really hope to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, polarizers, etc., to demonstrate optical experiments~
9. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing the electricity section first, then move on to magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember.
11. P4230: Okay okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
13. P4231: I saw the files in the group, thank you.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab's online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a user asking about uploading a high-resolution image without a watermark for their profile picture. The designer responds and asks if the user is a teacher. The conversation then shifts to the development plan and PC download link, and users start making suggestions and requests for the Physics Lab, including requests for demonstrations of mechanical waves and optical experiments.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will examine the interaction through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. We will explore how the designer and users collaborate to shape the development of the Physics Lab, how users' suggestions and requests influence the design process, and how the online community emerges through this interaction.

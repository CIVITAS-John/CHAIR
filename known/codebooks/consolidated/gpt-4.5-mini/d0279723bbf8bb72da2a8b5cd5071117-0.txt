You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: suggest improvements to ai systems, propose collaborative ai systems
- Users suggest improvements and request AI to implement their ideas.
- Interviewees envision user feedback contributing to a collaborative system that improves AI.

2.
Concepts: learning, reflect on ai interactions
- Reflects on the learning opportunities presented through interactions with AI.
- Users reflect on their interactions with AI and the variability of its responses during those interactions.

3.
Concepts: analyzes error messages, engage in error reasoning
- User reads and analyzes error messages before making decisions on code corrections.
- Users engage in reasoning to identify discrepancies and analyze error messages presented by the AI.

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. 
Concepts: suggest improvements to ai systems, propose collaborative ai systems
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as both involve user engagement with AI systems, where users not only suggest enhancements but also envision a collaborative relationship that fosters ongoing improvement.
Criteria: Users suggest improvements and propose collaborative AI systems by providing feedback that aims to enhance the functionality and effectiveness of AI.
Phrase: Enhance and collaborate with AI systems.

2. 
Concepts: learning, reflect on ai interactions
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as reflecting on AI interactions serves as a learning opportunity, allowing users to gain insights from their experiences with the AI's responses.
Criteria: Users engage in learning by reflecting on their interactions with AI, considering the variability of responses to enhance their understanding.
Phrase: Reflect and learn from AI interactions.

3. 
Concepts: analyzes error messages, engage in error reasoning
Relationship: The concepts are related as both involve a critical examination of error messages, where users analyze the information to engage in reasoning for effective problem-solving.
Criteria: Users analyze error messages and engage in reasoning to identify discrepancies and make informed decisions regarding code corrections.
Phrase: Analyze and reason through error messages.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

4. P8: The points wall is okay. - feedback; user experience; community validation
5. P8: I think it's okay. - agreement; validation; community building
6. P14: I also think it's okay. - consensus; community agreement; validation
7. Designer: Actually, you can learn from that mini-program. - learning opportunity; educational content; community resources
8. Designer: Creating questions, reviewing questions, and answering questions. - community engagement; user-generated content; knowledge sharing
9. P14: 怎么说？ - questioning; seeking clarification; community inquiry
10. P14: [Image 299] - visual communication; community sharing; knowledge representation
11. P17: Brainiac. - humor; community bonding; lightheartedness
12. P18: By the way, how do you use it? - inquiry; seeking information; community support
13. P18: Just downloaded it. - user experience; technology adoption; community exploration
14. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10 - resource sharing; community resources; knowledge exchange

Summary: This conversation continues to exhibit a sense of community, with participants engaging in active questioning, seeking clarification, and sharing knowledge. The Designer plays a crucial role in facilitating the conversation, providing insights, and clarifying concepts. The conversation touches on topics such as user experience, educational content, and community resources.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the conversation flows naturally, with participants building on each other's ideas and the Designer providing guidance. The use of visual communication (Image 299) and humor (Brainiac) adds to the sense of community and lightheartedness. I'll continue to explore how the Designer's role and the participants' interactions contribute to the emergence of the Physics Lab online community.

1. P2: It's not a brushless motor that connects to AC.
2. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
3. P14: 
4. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
5. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
6. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
7. P14: [Image]
8. P2: Has it been burned?
9. P4: Just play a rotating animation if you turn on the power, that's it 23333.
10. P2: Do we still need algorithms?
11. P4: 2333, it's simple.
12. P2: Algorithms are not simple.
13. P2: IGDT can also add @Designer 
14. P13: [Image]
15. P13: Are you all fake?
16. P13: Are you from outer space?
17. P13: I don't understand.
18. P2: Transistors can also be used.
19. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do normal experiments like this...
20. P11: 233 is in electronic circuits.
21. P11: I don't understand either.
22. P2: In the CPU.
23. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned some when I took an optional course in circuits.
24. P2: Add a bipolar capacitor.
25. P2: I learned by myself.
26. P11: That's great, if you have hobbies in it.
27. P14: @P11 Are there still distinctions between arts and sciences now?
28. P2: no
29. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
30. P14: [Image]

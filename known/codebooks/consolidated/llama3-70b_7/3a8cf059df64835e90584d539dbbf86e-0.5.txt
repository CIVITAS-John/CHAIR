You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

3.
Label: appreciating development progress
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]
- User: Oh, this is nice

Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

6.
Label: design/feature suggestion
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

Label: introducing self
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Hello everyone

8.

9.
Label: affirming user suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

10.
Label: emphasize convenience
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

11.
Label: accepting suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

12.
Label: providing direction
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- User: Left side

13.
Label: development update
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

14.
Label: considering user input
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm.

15.
Label: communicating development timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

16.
Label: revealing personal interests
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

17.
Label: provide rationale
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

18.
Label: mentions complexity of upcoming release
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

19.
Label: inquiring about classroom context
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

20.
Label: providing visual examples for clarity
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

21.
Label: providing reassurance of intuitive interface
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

22.
Label: open communication channels for problem solving and suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

23.
Label: considering user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

24.
Label: specifics
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

25.
Label: suggest educational enhancements
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

26.
Label: future design plan
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

27.
Label: plans sequential content development
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

28.
Label: promoting understanding of ideal components
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

29.
Label: outlining technical possibilities
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

30.
Label: explaining the purpose of the current circuit diagram version and the limitations of the auto layout algorithm
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

31.
Label: inquiring about user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

32.
Label: expresses gratitude for the community's support and pledges improvement
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

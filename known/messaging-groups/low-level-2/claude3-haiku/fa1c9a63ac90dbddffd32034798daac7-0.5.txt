You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation demonstrates the emergence of an online community within the Physics Lab, where members engage in various discussions, share information, and interact with each other. The community exhibits characteristics such as responsiveness, clarification, agreement, and a sense of shared interest in physics-related topics. The use of images and analogies further enhances the communication and understanding within the group.
1. P2: I'm talking about the software.
2. P11: Then ask the group owner.
3. Designer: Mars is outside the Earth.
4. Designer: What's the problem?
5. P4: No problem.
6. P2: What about the moon?
7. P1: The moon is not drawn, right?
8. P14: Maybe it hasn't been done yet.
9. P14: 
10. Designer: Last time it was too rushed.
11. P4: The moon is useless.
12. P4: 2333
13. Designer: It depends on the scale.
14. P2: Who said that?
15. P4: universe sandbox
16. Designer: There will be multiple presets.
17. Designer: Because in reality, you encounter many possible questions, many of which are about near-Earth space stations.
18. P11: Yes.
19. Designer: Artificial satellite orbits.
20. Designer: These will involve more.
21. Designer: Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter this normally...
22. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
23. P1: John, have you become more Android?
24. Designer: No, I'll update it today.
25. P17: [Image]
26. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
27. Designer: I'll buy a ticket to space.
28. P17: It's the starry sky.
29. P1: Don't imitate it exactly the same.
30. P14: There are also software imitating celestial bodies on Steam.

1.
Label: deliberate ai communication
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a simple perception" (interviewer's observation) Thinks a bit about whether to use "in NetLogo" or not.

2.
Label: prioritizing error analysis
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 reads error messages before making a choice.

3.
Label: chatlogo ability (negative): no fix option?
Quotes:
- E04: So, I guess that's kind of annoying because I didn't really want it to explain here, but that was the only option that I had. (interviewer's observation) E04 wants the "fix" option right after the errors are identified.

4.
Label: recognizing non deterministic nature of ai
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

5.
Label: proposes a simple coding task
Quotes:
- E01: So let's say "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square." (interviewer's observation) E01's first task.

6.
Label: interviewee reflecting on their personal interaction with chat gpt as if it were a person
Quotes:
- E01: I speak to (ChatGPT) like a person. I could just walk in the room and go write me code that does X, but I don't, I start with good morning. And it comes back, but it comes back with good morning. How can I assist you today? It's pretty good at figuring out natural language. So in some sense that you might just be better off, just pretend it's not a computer. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how he interacts with ChatGPT like a person.

7.
Label: identifying limitations in the ai's comprehensiveness
Quotes:
- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

8.
Label: adapting to outdated functionality
Quotes:
- E04: I guess, in their databases, they still have like, NetLogo 5 in there and stuff. So like, for example, you know, the anonymous functions, they still use like, the old, sometimes I'll get like, the old functionality for the anonymous functions. (interviewer's observation) Writing code in older versions of NetLogo

9.
Label: prioritizing self reliance
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E04 manually tries to fix the errors in the AI-generated code and did not choose "explain it".

10.
Label: finds current design challenging
Quotes:
- E04: Part of the issue that I'm having now is just kind of like the learning curve, just trying to figure out how everything works. (interviewer's observation) E04 mentions a learning curve, likely because our current design is not fine-tuned for experts.

11.
Label: attempts to correct plotting issue
Quotes:
- E04: Interesting because it's trying to plot the name, which I know is wrong, but I'm just trying to remember how to... (interviewer's observation) E04 reasons through the responses of ChatGPT.

12.
Label: making the generated code easy to read
Quotes:
- E01: I don't want chat GPT to write 27 operations in one line and show how brilliant it is. I wanted to separate out the code and, and it did a good job of not only did it write the code, but it commented the code. And then in addition to commenting the code externally, it did documentation. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT tends to provide comments and documentation. Generated code is easy to read.

13.
Label: interviewee emphasizing the need for realistic expectations when working with ai
Quotes:
- E01: And, and they don't, this is an unfamiliar task to them apparently. So they want to ask one question and get the right answer the first time. And I, I don't have that expectation. I'll ask the right question and it'll get me 80% of the way there. (interviewer's observation) Novices might have a too high expectation for ChatGPT (but it cannot achieve that).

14.
Label: the error that the user does not understand
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.

15.
Label: appreciates workflow efficiency
Quotes:
- E04: I really liked how, like the code that it generates, if you could just kind of place that into the model automatically.  (interviewer's observation) The capability to put into the model automatically.

16.
Label: requests verification
Quotes:
- E01: "can you verify that no more names are reserved words in NetLogo?" I don't know if it can do that. (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug after the third iteration, he asks ChatGPT to verify the code and produce no more bug. Unsure if it could do that.

17.
Label: notes limited options and tension between novice and expert design needs
Quotes:
- E04: Like in this type of, like, like I was saying with this window, for example, where it's giving you the options and basically there was that one time where the only option was for it to explain itself.  Which makes sense, but it'd be nice if I could just kind of like forego that and just keep doing, you know, But you know, for someone that's probably not as useful for someone who's like still learning, but like, I guess for someone who's more experienced, it's nice to be able to just like skip over things that you already know. (interviewer's observation) Options too limited; tension between a novice-oriented/expert-oriented design.

18.
Label: e04 desires automatic ai code integration
Quotes:
- E04: I really liked how, like the code that it generates, if you could just kind of place that into the model automatically.  (interviewer's observation) The capability to put into the model automatically.

19.
Label: e04 considers whether to include "in net logo" in ai requests
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a simple perception" (interviewer's observation) Thinks a bit about whether to use "in NetLogo" or not.

20.
Label: shares extensive experience in various programming languages since 1964
Quotes:
- E01: I started programming in 1964 at IBM. ... And since then I have programmed in production code in at least 20 different software languages. (interviewer's observation) E01's prior experiences in computer programming in general.

21.
Label: including doing one's own work and clearly describing the problem
Quotes:
- E01: if you approach the user group politely, graciously, and instead of dropping your entire code on it, you go, I narrowed it down to this. I read this documentation. I tried these eight things with this answer and I'm perplexed. If somebody goes, they paste their problem and it's clearly their homework and they want someone else to do it for them. No, I'm not going to help with that. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on proper practices to seek online help: do your own work and clearly describe what you need/tried.

22.
Label: interviewee reflecting on u.s. individualistic working culture
Quotes:
- E01: But you know, again, you have this culture, especially in the US of do your own work. People get a little too obsessive about doing their own work.  (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on U.S. individualistic working culture.

23.
Label: recognizing efficiency gains from ai assistance
Quotes:
- E04: And it could take a lot of time to like search the documentation and go online and try and figure out all those answers and just to have it like right there. So you can kind of stay within the task is really nice. (interviewer's observation) The capability to search for documentation and read it inside the workspace: esp. beneficial for novices.

24.
Label: suggests improvements
Quotes:
- E01: And some of them we still haven't been doing like hive mind, like how we are going to have the machine learning back from the user feedback or just from the compiler, right? You generate some code, but it doesn't work. So we have to tell you that this time, you didn't work. (interviewer's observation) The current ChatGPT implementation cannot check the generated code with external information (compiler, etc.) (partially solved by the Interpreter plugin, but only Python at this time)

25.
Label: appreciating ai's task understanding
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

26.
Label: compares with other resources
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

27.
Label: manually codes with ai guidance
Quotes:
- E04: (Throughout this phase. He uses generated code only for reference when writing his own.) (interviewer's observation) E04 writes code manually with the steps given by ChatGPT, rather than copy & paste code.

28.
Label: suggests ai for customized documentation
Quotes:
- E01: And you want doctors to use it, nurses to use it and medical transcriptionists to use it. They use a different word for whatever the verb for whatever it is you're saying you want them to do. And so, in some sense, their documentation has to be customized to their context to their user group. ... It's a language system. If you have a learning system that's actually capable of harvesting information, yeah, and a lot of them are not yet, but I think we'll get there. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to translate jargons between different sub-groups working in the same systems and ease the cost of writing customized documentation.

29.
Label: discussing how "writing instructions" is a capability that is missing on many people
Quotes:
- E01: In terms of learning experiences, like ramping up to using an assistant wrapping up to using ChatGPT might have some sort of evaluates. How well can you write instructions for another person? Some people just don't know how to conceptualize a problem. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how "writing instructions" is a capability that is missing on many people, and that is key to work with AI.

30.
Label: ai decides which direction the problem goes into  which could be an issue for novice users (as it limits
Quotes:
- E04: To me, it seems like you need to have a certain degree of expertise to understand where the errors are and how to fix them. Because otherwise it's like you're going down this path where you're blindly following the ChatGPT and you have no idea what's going on. For less experienced people, I wouldn't like that because it could put you in a worse situation. (interviewer's observation) Requires expertise to understand errors and debug them. Risks to blindly follow ChatGPT, esp. for less experienced people.

31.
Label: interviewee reflecting on seeking help online
Quotes:
- E01: I had a problem and I couldn't figure out how to solve this problem. I finally got online and I discovered there was this user group that would help you for free with problems. And it was stunning. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on seeking help online.

32.
Label: exploratory ai interactions
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a neural network" - I want to see if it actually pulls up the model. (interviewer's observation) E04 experiments with the AI to see what phrases could give a correct search result.

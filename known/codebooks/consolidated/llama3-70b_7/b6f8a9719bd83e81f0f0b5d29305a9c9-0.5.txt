You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: reassuring users, encouraging user patience
Relationship: The designer's actions of reassuring users and encouraging patience are closely linked, as reassurance can lead to increased patience, and patience is often necessary for users to accept reassurance.
Criteria: Designers alleviate user concerns and emphasize the importance of patience during delays.
Phrase: Reassuring users and encouraging patience.

2.
Concepts: share development plans, announce development plans
Relationship: Sharing and announcing development plans are two sides of the same coin, as sharing implies a more collaborative approach, while announcing implies a more formal declaration.
Criteria: Designers communicate future plans and next steps to users.
Phrase: Sharing and announcing development plans.

3.
Concepts: set and communicate project timelines
Relationship: Setting and communicating project timelines are sequential actions, as setting a timeline is necessary before it can be communicated to stakeholders.
Criteria: Designers establish and share project timelines with stakeholders to manage expectations.
Phrase: Setting and communicating project timelines.

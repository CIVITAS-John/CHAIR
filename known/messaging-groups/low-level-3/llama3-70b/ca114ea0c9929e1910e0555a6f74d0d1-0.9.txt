You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (1 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...
...
1. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
===
---
Thoughts: For this initial message, I will focus on describing the context and setting the tone for the online community. I will explore the role of the designer in shaping the community and the potential intentions behind sharing an image. I'll consider the human-computer interaction perspective to analyze the designer's actions.

Codes for each message:
1. Shares Image; Sets Tone; Designer's Intentions Unknown

Summary: The conversation starts with Designer-2 sharing an image (Image 2-0). The context and purpose of the image are unclear.

Notes: This initial message sets the stage for the online community. I hypothesize that the designer's action might be an attempt to set a positive tone or establish a visual identity for the community. The image might contain important information or symbols that will be revealed as the conversation unfolds.

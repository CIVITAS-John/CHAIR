You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

6.
Label: with regular updates and ongoing refinement based on user feedback
Quotes:

16.
Label: justifying focus on foundational features
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

17.

20.
Label: acknowledge limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

21.
Label: indicating phased approach to feature implementation
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

23.
Label: promotes inclusive design
Quotes:

24.
Label: providing progress updates
Quotes:
- Designer: We are working on this part

25.
Label: adding more specific information and criteria to the answer
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

26.
Label: explaining technical possibilities
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

27.
Label: explaining timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

28.
Label: consulting stakeholders

29.
Label: gather user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

30.
Label: explain intention of the app design
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

31.
Label: managing release timelines
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

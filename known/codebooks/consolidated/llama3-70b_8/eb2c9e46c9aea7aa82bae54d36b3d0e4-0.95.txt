You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: reiterate need for user manual
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

2.
Label: communication tone
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

3.

- Designer: Group sharing.

4.
Label: confirmation the developer's whole argument
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

5.
Label: simulated experiment
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

6.
Label: confirm finding information
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

7.
Label: iterative development based on user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

8.
Label: subject expansion
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

9.
Label: acknowledge resolution
Quotes:
- User: Updated

10.
Label: give usage instructions
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch

11.
Label: suggest improvements
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

12.
Label: provide practical advice
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

13.
Label: teacher-admin interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

14.
Label: provide feature details
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

15.
Label: development timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

16.
Label: make a suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

17.
Label: explain functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

18.
Label: plan for iterative feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

19.
Label: expression of interest
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

20.
Label: research and development
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

21.
Label: maintain transparency
Quotes:
- Designer: We are working on this part

22.
Label: community involvement
Quotes:

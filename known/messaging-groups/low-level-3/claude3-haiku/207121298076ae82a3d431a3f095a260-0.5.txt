You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P8: [Image 0]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
Preliminary tags: image upload; image quality; watermark removal; user interaction
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
Preliminary tags: platform specific question; user role
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary tags: image upload; user interaction; user role
5. P4229: Yes.
Preliminary tags: user role
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are in the group announcement.
7. Designer: Feel free to share any suggestions and needs.
8. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
9. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
10. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
13. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.

Summary: The conversation starts with a user sharing an image, which prompts the designer to ask about uploading high-quality images without a watermark. The discussion then shifts to the platform-specific capabilities of the Physics Lab software, with a teacher user asking about the PC version. The designer responds by offering to upload an image and inquiring about the user's role. The user confirms they are a teacher, and the designer then shares the development plan and PC download link with the community. 

The conversation then transitions to feature requests, with a user asking for dynamic demonstrations of wave and optics experiments. The designer acknowledges the feedback and indicates a plan to prioritize electricity and magnetism first, before gathering more opinions on the requested mechanics and optics features. The community members express appreciation for the designer's work and provide additional download-related questions, which are quickly resolved.

Overall, the conversation highlights the collaborative nature of the Physics Lab online community, where users provide feedback on desired features, and the designer is responsive to their needs and development priorities.

Notes: The community seems to be actively engaged in providing feedback and suggestions for the Physics Lab software. The designer appears to be open to user input and is working to balance development priorities based on the community's needs. The discussion suggests a strong interest in visual aids and interactive demonstrations, particularly in the areas of wave phenomena and optics. The community members also seem eager to access the PC/interactive whiteboard version of the software, indicating a diverse user base.

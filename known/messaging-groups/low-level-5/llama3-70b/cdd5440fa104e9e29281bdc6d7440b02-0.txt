You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (15 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
15. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary phrases: announcing changes; providing updates; managing expectations; setting new standards; refining simulations
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary phrases: introducing new features; highlighting capabilities; promoting ideal components; explaining functionality; enhancing realism
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary phrases: soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; fostering collaboration; seeking input; promoting user engagement
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary phrases: seeking guidance; expressing confusion; requesting clarification; exploring functionality; seeking support
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary phrases: providing technical information; addressing limitations; managing expectations; clarifying functionality; setting boundaries
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

Thoughts: In this round of coding, I will focus on understanding the interactions between designers and users in the Physics Lab online community. I will analyze the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will pay attention to how designers and users communicate, share knowledge, and collaborate. I will also explore how designers manage expectations, provide updates, and solicit feedback from users.

Interpretation phrases for each item:

1. announcing changes; providing updates; managing expectations; setting new standards; refining simulations
2. introducing new features; highlighting capabilities; promoting ideal components; explaining functionality; enhancing realism
3. soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; fostering collaboration; seeking input; promoting user engagement
4. seeking guidance; expressing confusion; requesting clarification; exploring functionality; seeking support
5. sharing visual information; providing context; illustrating points
6. providing technical information; addressing limitations; managing expectations; clarifying functionality; setting boundaries
7. sharing context; explaining constraints; highlighting limitations
8. offering solutions; providing alternatives; suggesting workarounds
9. confirming compatibility; providing reassurance; setting expectations
10. expressing gratitude; showing appreciation; acknowledging support
11. encouraging open communication; promoting transparency; fostering trust
12. providing feedback; sharing experiences; evaluating usability; highlighting strengths
13. considering limitations; exploring workarounds; addressing compatibility issues
14. providing theoretical explanations; clarifying technical details; setting boundaries
15. announcing updates; providing release notes; managing expectations; promoting engagement

Summary: The conversation revolves around designers and users discussing updates, features, and limitations of the Physics Lab software. Designers provide updates, introduce new features, and manage expectations, while users seek guidance, provide feedback, and share their experiences. The conversation is collaborative, with designers soliciting feedback and users offering suggestions.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, providing updates, and soliciting feedback to improve the software. Users are also actively participating, sharing their experiences, and providing feedback. The conversation is characterized by a sense of collaboration and mutual support.

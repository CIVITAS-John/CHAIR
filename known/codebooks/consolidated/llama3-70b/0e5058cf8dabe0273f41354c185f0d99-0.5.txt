You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: contextualization
- Providing context or background information for a question, user provides context or background information to explain their request or concern.
- Provision of background information or context and participants provide background information or context.

2.
Concepts: design philosophy
- A developer explains the intention or design philosophy behind the application.
- Statements about the underlying philosophy or approach to design.

3.
Concepts: resource access requests
- Inquiry about downloading or accessing a resource, participants explicitly ask for access to a resource or file.
- Users request or discuss accessing resources or software features.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: contextualization
Relationship: Inclusion (providing context or background information is a way of contextualizing a question or concern)
Criteria: Participants provide background information or context to explain their request or concern.
Label: Providing Context

2.
Concepts: design philosophy
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Developers explain the intention or design philosophy behind the application.
Label: Design Rationale

3.
Concepts: resource access requests
Relationship: Parallel (requests for access to resources or files are separate but related concepts)
Criteria: Participants explicitly ask for access to a resource or file, or discuss accessing resources or software features.
Label: Resource Access Requests

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

* Summary
The conversation revolves around the prioritization of content development in Physics Lab, with a user requesting specific demonstrations related to mechanical waves and vibrations along with optical experiments. The designers discuss their plans to focus on completing the electrical and magnetism sections first before moving on to mechanics. There is also a mention of changes in the components available in the upcoming updates.

* Plan
Analyzing this conversation through the lens of learning sciences would involve examining how the designers prioritize content development based on educational value and user needs. In terms of human-computer interaction, it would be interesting to explore how users' requests and feedback influence the design decisions and update processes. Lastly, from a participatory design perspective, it is crucial to understand how users like User-4230 actively contribute to shaping the direction of Physics Lab through their suggestions and requests.

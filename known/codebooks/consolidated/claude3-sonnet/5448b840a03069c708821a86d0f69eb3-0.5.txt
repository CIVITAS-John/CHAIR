You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

3. {Repeat the input 3}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 3}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 3}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 3}
Category: {2-4 words for code 3}

~~~
1. active learning, conceptual learning support.
- Aspects of the software that encourage active learning, experimentation, or hands-on engagement with physics concepts.
- Features or affordances of the software aimed at helping users understand physics concepts, through visualization, simulation or other means.

2. role identification, teacher/educator role.
- Users explicitly or implicitly identifying their roles or affiliations within the community.
- Identifying users who explicitly state or imply that they are teachers, educators, or have a teaching/instructional role.

3. emoji usage, image sharing.
- Instances where participants use emojis in their communication, potentially indicating shared norms or practices within the community.
- Instances where participants share images or screenshots, potentially indicating shared norms or practices within the community.

Categories:
* Pedagogical Design
* Community Roles
* Communication Practices

Definitions for each code (3 in total):

1. active learning, conceptual learning support.
Relationship: These concepts are parallel, both relating to the pedagogical design of the software.
Criteria: Features or aspects of the software that facilitate active, hands-on learning and conceptual understanding of physics through simulations, visualizations or other interactive means.
Label: Interactive pedagogical design
Category: Pedagogical Design

2. role identification, teacher/educator role. 
Relationship: The second concept is a specific case of the first, more general concept.
Criteria: Instances where users explicitly or implicitly identify their roles within the community, with a focus on those who state or imply an educator or teaching role.
Label: Role identification (educator roles)
Category: Community Roles  

3. emoji usage, image sharing.
Relationship: These concepts are parallel, both relating to communication practices within the community.
Criteria: Instances where participants use emojis or share images/screenshots, potentially indicating shared norms or practices of communication within the community.
Label: Multimodal communication practices
Category: Communication Practices

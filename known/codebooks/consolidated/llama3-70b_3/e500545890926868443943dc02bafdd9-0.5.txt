You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: discusses the limitations in exploring other directions for free experiments
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

17.
Label: suggesting a possible future development in chemistry
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

18.
Label: requesting an export function or the ability to save and import experiments
Quotes:

19.
Label: propose potential solution
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

20.
Label: confirms being a teacher
Quotes:

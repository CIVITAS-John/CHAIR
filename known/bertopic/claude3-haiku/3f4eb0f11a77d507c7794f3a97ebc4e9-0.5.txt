- User: Yes.
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- User: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: explain future plans; provide details; align with educational needs
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: express approval; provide positive feedback; acknowledge idea
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: plan for consultation; invite feedback; engage with community
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: consult users; seek feedback; align with educational standards
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: confirm understanding; seek clarification; provide visual reference
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirm common practice; provide feedback; align with educational standards
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation illustrates a collaborative design process where designers actively seek and incorporate feedback from users, particularly teachers, to align the Physics Lab's features with educational standards. Designers explain their plans and provide detailed information about upcoming functionalities, such as simulated experiment assessment for electricity. Users respond positively, validating the designers' direction and contributing to design decisions, such as the style of circuit diagrams. The interaction highlights a participatory approach, with designers consulting the community, addressing feedback, and iterating on their designs. The conversation also touches on the practical aspects of software development, including update schedules and platform-specific releases.

Notes: The conversation suggests a strong emphasis on participatory design, with designers actively engaging the community to ensure the product meets educational needs. There is a clear iterative process, with feedback loops involving users, particularly educators. Future analysis could explore how this participatory approach impacts user satisfaction and learning outcomes. Additionally, examining the balance between usability and educational accuracy in design decisions would provide further insights into the development process.

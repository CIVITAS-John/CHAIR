Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation covers various topics related to physics and chemistry, including the use of equipment and software in labs, as well as exam-related considerations. There are also some social interactions, such as tagging, agreement, acknowledgment, self-disclosure, criticism, and complaints.
1. P2: What do you need ads for, @Designer 
2. Designer: Health...
3. Designer: Doing this requires hiring people...
4. P1: It's free.
5. Designer: Actually, it's similar to charging money, but if you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay...
6. P2: Oh.
7. Designer: Do more of it.
8. Designer: There are some other ways as well.
9. P8: The points wall is okay.
10. P8: @Designer I think it's okay.
11. P14: I also think it's great.
12. Designer: Actually, you can learn that mini program.
13. Designer: Creating questions, reviewing questions, and answering questions.
14. P14: What do you mean?
15. P14: [Image]
16. P17: Brain Out.
17. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
18. P18: Just downloaded it.

Summary: The conversation so far has focused on various topics related to physics and chemistry, including the use of equipment and software in labs, as well as exam-related considerations. There are also some social interactions, such as tagging, agreement, acknowledgment, self-disclosure, criticism, and complaints.

Notes: The conversation is still in the early stages, and the focus is on technical and academic topics related to physics and chemistry. The social interactions are mostly related to agreement, acknowledgment, and suggestions. As the conversation progresses, it would be interesting to see if more social dynamics emerge, such as conflict, support, or community-building.

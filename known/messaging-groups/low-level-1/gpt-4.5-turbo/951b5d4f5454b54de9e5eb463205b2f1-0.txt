1. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken.
8. P14: [Image]
9. P14: What do you mean?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top. 233333
11. P14: The condensed liquid won't flow back, right?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh, I see.
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year.
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be about electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay.
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?

Summary: The conversation in the Physics Lab's online messaging group revolves around a mix of technical discussions on chemistry and physics topics, interspersed with social interactions that include inquiries, clarifications, agreements, and personal opinions. Participants engage in both asking and answering questions, sharing resources, and expressing their understanding or lack thereof.

Notes: The emergence of the online community can be seen in how participants actively engage with each other, seeking and providing help, and sharing opinions and experiences. The use of humor, tagging for attention, and the sharing of visual content also contribute to a more interactive and engaged community atmosphere. The conversation shows a blend of learning, peer support, and casual interaction, which are key elements in the development of an online educational community.

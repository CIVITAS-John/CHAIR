You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

2.
Label: designer 1 outlines simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:

If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

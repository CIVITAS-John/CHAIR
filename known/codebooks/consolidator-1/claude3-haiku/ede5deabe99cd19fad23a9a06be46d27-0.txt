You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
Can you identify more categories for merging?
Yes, I can identify a few more categories that can be merged:
- "community communication" and "community dynamics" could be merged into a single category called "community engagement"
- "technical aspects" and "educational factors" could be potentially be merged into a broader category called "contextual factors"

Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
The category "technical aspects" seems quite broad and could potentially be split into more specific subcategories, such as "design and software" and "technical constraints and support".

Is any naming inaccurate?
The naming of the categories seems accurate and concise.

# Final Merging
* communication approach
* community interaction and participation
=> community communication

* community formation and dynamics 
* user engagement and participation
=> community dynamics

* design, software, and scientific content
* technical constraints and complexity
* technical knowledge and support
=> technical aspects

* educational context and factors
* learning, guidance, and knowledge sharing
=> educational factors

* community communication
* community dynamics
=> community engagement

* technical aspects
* educational factors
=> contextual factors

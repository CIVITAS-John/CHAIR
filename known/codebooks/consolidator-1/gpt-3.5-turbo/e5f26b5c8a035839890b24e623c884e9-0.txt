You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You are finding and organizing categories from existing ones. A list of initial categories and qualitative codes is provided.
Merge categories that are too specific. Optimize names of the rest to be more representative.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: Some categories are too specific and can be merged to create broader categories. For example, merging "communication acknowledgment" and "communication clarity" into a more general category like "communication dynamics." Additionally, some categories have overlapping content and can be combined to streamline the analysis. The goal is to create a more concise and comprehensive set of refined categories that capture the essence of the data without unnecessary fragmentation.

Categories to merge:
1. communication acknowledgment

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: asks ai questions, deliberates on phrasing for ai queries
- Formulating or asking questions to AI
- The user deliberates on phrasing for AI queries.

2.
Concepts: engages in ai interaction, engage in ai conversation
- The participant engages in interactions with AI, asking follow-up questions
- Participants interact with AI like a human and engage in conversation with AI.

3.
Concepts: express frustration with ai, critique ai error messaging
- Participants express frustration with AI hallucinations and experience frustration with AI's performance or limitations.
- Participants critique AI error messaging and experience conflict or frustration when AI-driven interfaces provide incorrect information.

4.
Concepts: effort, mentions learning curve
- Comments about the effort or time required to learn or use the AI, particularly for experts.
- The perceived difficulty and effort required to learn and effectively use the LLM-driven interface.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: asks ai questions, deliberates on phrasing for ai queries
Relationship: The two concepts are interconnected as deliberating on phrasing for AI queries enables the user to ask effective questions to AI.
Criteria: Participants deliberate on phrasing for AI queries to ask effective questions.
Phrase: Crafting AI questions.

2.
Concepts: engages in ai interaction, engage in ai conversation
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants engage in conversations with AI and interact with it like a human.
Phrase: Interacting with AI.

3.
Concepts: express frustration with ai, critique ai error messaging
Relationship: The two concepts are interconnected as frustration with AI's performance or limitations leads to critiquing its error messaging.
Criteria: Participants express frustration with AI's performance and critique its error messaging.
Phrase: Critiquing AI limitations.

4.
Concepts: effort, mentions learning curve
Relationship: The two concepts are interconnected as the learning curve requires effort to overcome.
Criteria: Participants mention the effort required to learn and use the LLM-driven interface due to its learning curve.
Phrase: Overcoming the learning curve.

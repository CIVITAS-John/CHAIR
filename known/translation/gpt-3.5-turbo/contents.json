        "简易三相输电系统\n实验展示的是三相输电系统，发电厂通常输出三个相位的交流电，分别是0度，120度和240度。三个相位的交流电相电压为220伏，线电压为380伏。三个相位的交流电经过多级变压，进入城市。城市内输电系统主要有两种电压，一种是10KV。另一种则是0.4KV，一般只需要一个变压器就可以完成互相转换，日常生活中能见到架在电线杆上的变压器就属于这种。它们的容量在1000KVA左右，能满足一百多户普通用户或几个工业车间的用电需求。日常家庭一般仅使用一个相位以获取220伏电压，为了使三相平衡，不同住户用的相位可能不同，220伏单相电一般能满足正常家庭的需求。而工业用电一般为380伏，三相电。因为大功率异步电机只能使用三相电驱动，所以三相电又称为动力电或工业电。而且三相电电压更高，能在同等电流下获得更大功率。日常能接触到的三相电器有：中央空调主机、电梯、大功率电炉等\n实验中变压器低压侧采用星形接法，三相四线制。高压侧采用三角形接法，三相三线制。右边万用表显示相电压220伏，左边万用表显示线电压380伏。\n三个相位和零线分别用四种不同颜色的导线表示。A相为黄色导线，B相为绿色导线，C相为红色导线，中性线（零线，N线）为黑色导线。",
        "Simple Three-Phase Power Transmission System\nThe experiment demonstrates a three-phase power transmission system. Power plants usually output three-phase alternating current at 0 degrees, 120 degrees, and 240 degrees. The phase voltage of the three-phase alternating current is 220 volts, and the line voltage is 380 volts. The three-phase alternating current passes through multiple transformers and enters the city. There are mainly two types of voltages in the city's power transmission system, one is 10KV, and the other is 0.4KV. Usually, only one transformer is needed to convert between them, and the transformers seen on electric poles belong to this type. Their capacity is around 1000KVA, which can meet the electricity needs of over a hundred ordinary users or several industrial workshops. In daily life, households generally use one phase to obtain 220 volts, and to balance the three phases, different households may use different phases. 220-volt single-phase electricity can generally meet the needs of a normal household. Industrial electricity is generally 380 volts, three-phase electricity. High-power asynchronous motors can only be driven by three-phase electricity, so three-phase electricity is also called power or industrial electricity. Three-phase electricity has a higher voltage and can obtain greater power under the same current. Common three-phase electrical appliances in daily life include: central air conditioners, elevators, high-power electric stoves, etc. The low-voltage side of the transformer in the experiment is connected in a star configuration, three-phase four-wire system. The high-voltage side is connected in a delta configuration, three-phase three-wire system. The multimeter on the right shows a phase voltage of 220 volts, and the one on the left shows a line voltage of 380 volts. The three phases and neutral line are represented by four different colored wires. The A phase is represented by a yellow wire, B phase by a green wire, C phase by a red wire, and the neutral line (zero line, N line) by a black wire."

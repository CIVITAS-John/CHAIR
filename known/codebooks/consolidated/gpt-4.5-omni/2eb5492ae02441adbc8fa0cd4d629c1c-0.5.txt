Label: propose school as sustainable city
Quotes:
- Contributor 36: Using the school scenario or classroom as a case study to apply sustainable urban design concepts to broader contexts is a valuable approach. By framing the school itself as a 'small city,' students can exercise epistemic agency and bring in their own creative ideas to make the environment more sustainable. Allowing students to redesign their school or even visit and improve another school (I have witnessed in some scenarios this idea take place with older students and have significant results), while aligning with collective responsibility, fosters a real-world application that remains within a controlled environment.
Drawing from my experience in a Jewish school, one sustainability initiative involved turning off electricity for an entire day, encouraging outdoor activities. While collective responsibility was evident, epistemic agency was less emphasized. If we embrace the principle of idea diversity, students could propose even more varied and innovative ways to make their environment sustainable, from smaller changes in their school to potential city-wide applications.
Incorporating local and global contexts would require prompts or frameworks that encourage students to see how their school-based ideas could scale up to influence broader urban design issues. For example, you might ask students: How could your ideas for a sustainable school be applied to public spaces or larger city infrastructure? This could encourage them to think beyond their immediate surroundings while ensuring they remain grounded in real ideas and authentic problems.
Additionally, using peer feedback and integrating community perspectives (like those from local environmental experts or Indigenous knowledge) can enrich the conversation. This provides students with authoritative sources while also promoting critical thinking about how local and global solutions intersect. Ultimately, structuring the classroom as a knowledge-building community where students are both the designers and the decision-makers allows for deeper engagement and more meaningful learning.

Label: emphasize idea improvement
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: I have been thinking about the question that Contributor 25 suggested posing with students: 
 
   we first asked 'How DO cities all over the world reduce waste?' and have students seek sources to inform about this, including their own parents who come from many different areas of the world, and then use these ideas as a basis for idea improvement?  Better yet, keeping curriculum areas in mind, I wonder if we could ask 'How do cities all over the world reduce non-renewable energy sources?' or 'How do cities all over the world use rocks and minerals?'  These seem like traditional questions related to content knowledge but they could be good catalysts for idea improvement, since students need this basis of knowledge in the first place.  Following the initial questions and interacting with the research they yield, we could ask 'How could they do this better?'What do you think?  Would this align with a KB process or might there be a tweak that could still get at personal relevance (e.g. family experience with international locations) and content knowledge in a different way?

This trip would focus on sustainability and could include a trip to eco friendly spaces, gardents etc. This can allow students to be able to visualize it in person which can inspire them and contribute to new ideas for their sustainable city. Furthermore, students could even engage with the local community in different sustainability initiatives such as, gardening, tree planting, cleaning up the community etc. This hands on learning experience can allow them to make a difference and engage with the learning in a meaningful way.  -

Quotes:
- Contributor 31: What are people's thoughts about ways to integrate AI into a Knowledge Building process related to designing a sustainable city?
Over the past few years I have used ChatGPT to generate a source related to topics we are working on in class.  I find that some of the advanced vocabulary of other sources alienates some readers, and even though we want them to work through challenging texts, there seems to be a sweet spot for the extent of challenge that works without losing engagement.
When I asked ChatGPT to tell me about strategies for creating sustainable urban design using vocabulary suitable for a 9 year old, it provided this response:
Cities around the world are making changes to be more environmentally friendly and protect nature. Here are some ways they are doing it:
 
 **Building Green Spaces**: Cities are creating more parks, gardens, and areas with trees and plants. These green spaces help clean the air, provide homes for animals, and give people a place to enjoy nature.

 **Using Renewable Energy**: Instead of using fuels that pollute the air, some cities are using *renewable energy* sources like wind, water, and sunlight to power homes and buildings. This helps reduce pollution.


 **Encouraging Public Transportation**: Cities are making it easier for people to take buses, trains, or ride bikes instead of using cars. This reduces the number of cars on the road, which means less pollution and cleaner air.

 **Creating Bike and Walking Paths**: Many cities are building safe paths for people to bike and walk. This encourages people to get around without using cars, which is better for the environment.


 **Installing Rooftop Gardens**: Some buildings have gardens on their rooftops! These *rooftop gardens* help keep the buildings cooler, save energy, and provide a nice place for insects and birds.

 

 **Collecting Rainwater**: Some cities have special systems to collect and store rainwater. This water can be used for things like watering gardens or cleaning streets, which saves drinking water.

 
These features help cities take care of the environment, making them better places to live for people, animals, and plants.

What do people think of using a text like this?  Could each section be used as an area for idea improvement? On the other hand is it too prescriptive to start with something like this?
I am also wondering what other applications of AI might work in our context.  We have experimented a bit with schoolai.com, where students can discuss topics with AI.  I am not sure how we could cite that as a source, or use it intentionally in the process.
Any ideas related to using AI in our design are welcome!

Label: emphasize right track confirmation
Quotes:
- Contributor 24: Suggest examples of improvements
The tool can give you some fairly precise critique or suggestions for your work, but it currently does not give you examples of the kinds of improvements it wants. It would be interesting if it was able to do so, and maybe give you a headstart or a point of comparison. Of course, this opens up a whole slew of questions regarding authorship and idea generation.
 
Visibility on back end
The AI tool is not easily understood or interpreted by users in the sense that it makes decisions based on a back-end data set. However, it is difficult right now to trace how our inputs lead to the outputs. Enhancing the interpretability and transparency will help students understand why the output is giving us this feedback, and will probably increase adoption as our trust in the tool leading us in the right direction will increase.
 
Iterative feedback
It would be useful if the AI was able to take into account previous feedback and word/structure its followup feedback against this. For example, it could tell you how many improvements you've addressed or give you some other kind of marker regarding your progress.
 
Scaffold/Principle Specific Feedback
It may be helpful for the AI tool to provide feedback based on specific KB principles or scaffolds in order to narrow down the scope of what’s being talked about.

Label: reflect on sustainability definitions
Quotes:
- Contributor 19: Hi folks. Just wanted to make a quick note on how interesting I think your definition of (lack of) sustainability is: 
I would imagine most people would associate the term sustainability first-and-foremost (and perhaps exclusively) with the environment. I might have a bit of a bias here given my background in Biology, but I would say that's also the case in my other background: Political Science.
I find it interesting not only that you include the idea of avoiding harm to society, but also that you put it first. I feel like we can run with that analogy/comparison even further. Like the environment, there will still be an environment left no matter how poorly we manage the globe, it might just be a polluted, toxic wasteland. Similarly, there will certainly be society in the future, but we may do lasting harm to it if we are not careful.
Sorry I'm not building on your designs, but I thought that was fascinating! Thanks for that!

- Contributor 18: The AI-powered generative feedback option on KF suggested I deepen connections, consider broader implications, and integrating course concepts further. Here is my attempt:
Echo chambers and mental fatigue limit knowledge building by reducing exposure to diverse ideas and draining cognitive energy. Personally, I’ve noticed doomscrolling impacts my creativity and deep and critical thinking skills. An algorithm that challenges these patterns would encourage deeper engagement and shared responsibility for improving communal knowledge.
In terms of broader implications, an algorithm that promotes    could fundamentally change how we interact in digital spaces, aligning with    by giving users more control over their knowledge landscape. Addressing burnout through a scoping review could also create more inclusive and sustainable knowledge-building environments, helping individuals overcome barriers like mental fatigue by building the body of knowledge around it together.

Label: suggest cross group discussions
Quotes:
- Contributor 15: I was thinking the exact same thing!
   Groups should be able to learn from other groups. If there is an initial presentation of ideas, this would lead to an adoption and adaptation of further growth for other groups. Another way to tackle this would be for a time where students can wander to other groups to see what they have done. A third example could be for groups to send a representative for each part of their city development and all those people to gather and discuss their ideas and then bring it back to their group to gather all the information together. A fourth way would be to not restrict specific roles for discussion but for the different aspects of the city to meet without restriction on how many people. An example would be for all people who want to talk about waste management to go to a designated corner and discuss for 20 minutes. There's endless ways to allow for cross-breeding of ideas and development.  -

In using Artificial Intelligence in such a way, the rubric criteria are slowly introduced as the student pro-actively engages with their own learning process, to allow them to find and meet their own challenges in real time. This dynamic procedure nurtures not only a sense of community, but also assures that students are constantly engaged in reflections and improvements of their contributions toward an advance in group knowledge. Nowadays, the achievement charts is that there very restrictive and narrow-minded. These are requested and expected in the educational processes in the classrooms.  the achievement chart was adaptable the student's progress? A question we still have is how can this idea can work in a group setting? Would all student receive the same feeback and guidelines?
 
After our first brainstorm iteration, we have gone back and thought about such a tool from a sustainability perspective. Two wonderings came from this:

Could such a tool help students who are otherwise 'invisible' or missed by teachers to get prompt and useful feedback. In a classroom of 30 students, some students's needs will inevitably get more attention than others.
Could such a tool re-entrench access issues, if it is not culturally responsive/diverse, and thus is more adapted to interface with certain students?

Label: propose informed decision making
Quotes:
- Contributor 11: To build on this group's discussions, it is imperitive to address the condition in which the groups are formed. I like how this group identified as a path to move forward by grouping students . One way to extend this, would be to provide students with an opportunity to explore each topic before deciding on a group to ensure that they make an informed decision.    is that some students may choose a topic based on a friend's choice in order to work together.    having students submit their group choice privately, by having each student write down their group choice on paper and hand it to their teacher.  I believe that this should support    as students interact with each other in new ways, or interact with students they have not worked with before as . the division of topics, what if some groups are larger than others, what is some topics are not selected by any students.    students rank their topic choices and an algorithm develops the groups to ensure an even distruibution of students between the topics, while considering the student preferences?

Label: discuss sustainability in education and technology
Quotes:
- Contributor 3: Sustainability in education and technology could refer to many different practices and strategies that ensure educational practices and technological systems are maintained in ways that benefit current and future generations without depleting resources or causing long-term harm to society, or even the environment. Our group had many different interpretations of what this could mean:Contributor 35: My mind immediately went to Data Privacy and Security. With the increase of digital platforms and online learning tools, student data privacy and security have become major concerns in schools and in fact, a concern for anyone using technology. There are serious concerns around data privacy and ethical usage, as we see more discourse on where we draw the lines, deeper conversation about digital literacy, and AI readiness. These concerns are particularly significant because education involves sensitive information about minors and vulnerable populations.Solution:
   In Knowledge Building, the community shares responsibility for advancing knowledge ('Collective Responsibility for Advancing Community Knowledge' (From Proto to Systemic Knowledge Building by Marlene Scardamalia). This principle can be applied as a solution by encouraging collective efforts across teams (e.g., AI developers, security experts, teachers, data scientists, and policymakers) to continuously update and refine AI security protocols.Encouraging collective efforts across different experts, to continuously update and refine AI and other learning tools is a sustainable way to leverage expert knowledge, and build these tools with human well-being and pedogogy in mind.  
Contributor 37: From a designer’s perspective, the educational sustainability issue that first comes to mind is the use of eco-friendly materials in the classroom. Contributor 28 has also mentioned the knowledge and ways of thinking needed to achieve economic prosperity. Building on this, technology could serve as a powerful solution for reducing the physical costs of classroom activities by transitioning to digital resources that minimize paper waste and energy consumption. 
In addition, I think accessibility in education also involves considering social sustainability and ensuring that learning tools and environments are inclusive of different languages, cultural perspectives, and learning needs.
Solution: using technology, the knowledge could be built into dynamic, recyclable and expandable learning modules/communities.  And from this perspective we could use encourage students to share diverse viewpoints on sustainability practices and design solutions that cater to different needs.
Yuqi:Technology and education involve the interaction between humans and computers. When considering sustainability in technology and education, we should consider both the sustainable use of technology and the sustainability of human resources and societal systems.
Contributor 30:    During our conversation about technology and school sustainability, we touched on a number of crucial topics. The growing worry over data privacy was one important factor, especially in light of the increased use of digital platforms in education. We also discussed the necessity of responsible tech use in the classroom, meaning pupils use it for meaningful learning rather than just busy work, and the shift to digital materials to cut down on waste. Another hot topic was accessibility, since not every student has equal access to technology, which might make it difficult to create a fair learning environment. When taken as a whole, these observations show how important it is to approach the sustainable integration of technology in education with caution and moderation.Contributor 28: Technology in Education; can refer to many facets of teaching/learning provided that technology is present is some shape or form. EX the SAMR model (Substitution, Aumentation, Modification, Redefinition) once youve figured out your discourse and how to use your technology responsibly I beelive that it can be a huge support in teaching. Furthermore the sustainability comes to reposnible usage of the tech in the classsroom and the preparedness of the students to use if responsibly. Some possible drawbacks to technology in education would strictly be due to accessibility issues. how available is the tech, are there pay walls and can each and every student use it regardless of economic background.    the SAMR model was shared acroos the board and not just in educational fields allowing for anyone implementing tech in educations to really thing about the way the use technology in an educational format that can support students and not just 'busy work' Contributor 10: Professional development immediately comes to mind. I believe that we must first equip educational practitioners in order to achieve the sustainability of education and technology. If they could not successfully incorporate these theories and have access to ongoing technologies and practices, how could they pass this to their students in learning process?

1. Schools can host online webinars, host online learning platform, or offline forums, etc to sustain the knowledge-building and advancement processes. Take my school for example, we organize regular parent forums (almost monthly) inviting parents to share their experiences or lessons learned from their interactions with their children, inviting psychologists to share knowledge about the physical and mental development characteristics of children of certain age brackets, etc. The school community member's together with the idea diversity brought from their perspectives will advance the state of community knowledge. Some schools have launched parents' learning center to involve them in the knowledge building process, but  as far as I know  -an artefact like Knowledge Forum is put to use to address this issue 2. Well, what schools can try to do is to share the overarching goal of the process is to benefit their children and their involvement is very vital for personal knowledge gains. This shows the importance a platform like KB or human communication.

Since it is in line with many of the previously described principles, I support the idea of using an AI-based scoring system to improve knowledge-building (KB) procedures. In this case, Improvable Ideas are crucial since the AI can provide dynamic, scaffolded feedback that changes as students develop.

The idea behind the hidden score is to promote collective responsibility, community knowledge through multi-grade collaboration that guarantees a diversity of viewpoints. Every student, regardless of ability level, contributes meaningfully to conversations, demonstrating Democratizing Knowledge. dawidGroup 4! your idea of using an AI-based scoring system to adjust feedback and match students based on their discourse skills is a great way to support Improvable Ideas and Transformative Assessment. By tailoring challenges to each student’s level, it encourages continuous growth. Adding reflective prompts could enhance Epistemic Agency, helping students take ownership of their progress. The multi-grade collaboration concept, where high-score students act as peer tutors, aligns well with Community Knowledge and motivates all students to actively engage in learning. -

Label: emphasize indigenous knowledge integration
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: I am teaching a Grade 4/5 class in Scarborough, Ontario.  We have a multicultural community of 26 students, with a variety of learning needs as well as many multilingual students.  It is an energetic space and we have many promising ideas!
We are developing our Knowledge Building community, and are planning to focus on a classroom exploration related to sustainable urban design.  An internet search for educator resources yields a variety of approaches to this big idea, and many of them seem to align with more traditional project-based learning.  An example of a possible design for a classroom STEM project can be found here (Link -> https://www.educationworld.com/a_lesson/Stem-Challenge-Sustainable-City).     facets of Systemic Knowledge Building.  How could this type of project be advanced to align with KB principles and practices?  What would need to shift?  What designs could be put in place to explore sustainable cities in the context of a Knowledge Building Community? My curriculum context is such that I need to make connections to learning about Energy (Grade 5) and Rocks and Minerals (Grade 4), as well as many expectations from the Ontario Language curriculum, and possibly our Social Studies curriculum.  It is also imperative that our learning relate to Indigenous ways of knowing, and our school board is working to ensure that educators implement Indigenous Education throughout all curriculum areas by learning from First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples, communities, nations, and perspectives.
I welcome any ideas about how to approach this topic from a Knowledge Building perspective.  How might our class move forward with this work?

Label: emphasize idea development
Quotes:
- Contributor 15: I was thinking the exact same thing!
   Groups should be able to learn from other groups. If there is an initial presentation of ideas, this would lead to an adoption and adaptation of further growth for other groups. Another way to tackle this would be for a time where students can wander to other groups to see what they have done. A third example could be for groups to send a representative for each part of their city development and all those people to gather and discuss their ideas and then bring it back to their group to gather all the information together. A fourth way would be to not restrict specific roles for discussion but for the different aspects of the city to meet without restriction on how many people. An example would be for all people who want to talk about waste management to go to a designated corner and discuss for 20 minutes. There's endless ways to allow for cross-breeding of ideas and development.  -

Label: propose child friendly vocabulary
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: What are people's thoughts about ways to integrate AI into a Knowledge Building process related to designing a sustainable city?
Over the past few years I have used ChatGPT to generate a source related to topics we are working on in class.  I find that some of the advanced vocabulary of other sources alienates some readers, and even though we want them to work through challenging texts, there seems to be a sweet spot for the extent of challenge that works without losing engagement.
When I asked ChatGPT to tell me about strategies for creating sustainable urban design using vocabulary suitable for a 9 year old, it provided this response:
Cities around the world are making changes to be more environmentally friendly and protect nature. Here are some ways they are doing it:
 
 **Building Green Spaces**: Cities are creating more parks, gardens, and areas with trees and plants. These green spaces help clean the air, provide homes for animals, and give people a place to enjoy nature.

 **Using Renewable Energy**: Instead of using fuels that pollute the air, some cities are using *renewable energy* sources like wind, water, and sunlight to power homes and buildings. This helps reduce pollution.


 **Encouraging Public Transportation**: Cities are making it easier for people to take buses, trains, or ride bikes instead of using cars. This reduces the number of cars on the road, which means less pollution and cleaner air.

 **Creating Bike and Walking Paths**: Many cities are building safe paths for people to bike and walk. This encourages people to get around without using cars, which is better for the environment.


 **Installing Rooftop Gardens**: Some buildings have gardens on their rooftops! These *rooftop gardens* help keep the buildings cooler, save energy, and provide a nice place for insects and birds.

 

 **Collecting Rainwater**: Some cities have special systems to collect and store rainwater. This water can be used for things like watering gardens or cleaning streets, which saves drinking water.

 
These features help cities take care of the environment, making them better places to live for people, animals, and plants.

What do people think of using a text like this?  Could each section be used as an area for idea improvement? On the other hand is it too prescriptive to start with something like this?
I am also wondering what other applications of AI might work in our context.  We have experimented a bit with schoolai.com, where students can discuss topics with AI.  I am not sure how we could cite that as a source, or use it intentionally in the process.
Any ideas related to using AI in our design are welcome!

Quotes:
- Contributor 12: Hi Contributor 10,
I love that idea!    Thinking of the entire class as a sustainable city where each group represents a community really brings a sense of interconnectedness to the project. It would also give students the opportunity to see how their individual efforts contribute to the bigger picture of sustainability. By having each group focus on a specific topic and engage in research and fieldwork, we could ensure that every student has a role in improving both their 'neighbourhood' and the overall sustainability of the class-city.

Quotes:
- Contributor 31: Thanks to your group for all of the great starting points.  I am thinking about many aspects of your ideas.
One part of your contribution that resonated with me relates to this suggestion:
I have worked with students in the past in order to try to develop solutions problems in our local environment and we have had a hard time going beyond designing something to pick up garbage in the school yard.  This is a real issue for us, but I wonder how we can find a balance between imagination and extension and broader world contexts and our own backyard.
Your suggestion does seem to relate to systemic Knowledge Building, in that  
I am wondering what structures in the classroom might best support awareness of broader contexts and problems so that 
I would like to go beyond designing a robot that picks up trash, which is what I have seen students do in the past.  What specific prompts, resources or frameworks do you thnk might best support the integration of local and global contexts, keeping KB principles in mind?

Label: emphasize authoritative sources
Quotes:
- Contributor 33: Encouraging students to express their interests on the first day, rather than presenting predefined sustainability problems, enhances epistemic agency. Having students work in their groups of interest will allow them to focus on different aspects of the curriculum while also learning about something that they are very passionate about. This approach empowers students to take ownership of their learning by allowing them to choose areas of focus that resonate with them. It fosters greater engagement, as students are more likely to invest in topics they feel connected to. This type of work also shows students that their ideas are valued and that they have control over their learning. This strategy not only aligns with knowledge building principles but also helps cultivate a more dynamic and participatory classroom environment. Another important aspect to emphasize is the principle of constructive use of authoritative sources during student research. Encourage students not to avoid complex knowledge sources and to appreciate expert opinions. However, they should also recognize the value of personal experiences and insights that may not be readily available online. This approach fosters a more holistic understanding of sustainability, allowing students to integrate various forms of knowledge and perspectives into their projects, ultimately enriching their learning experience and community discussions.
 Incorporating diverse perspectives, such as those of elders or Indigenous communities, into the study of sustainable practices encourages students to look beyond immediate sources of information. It is essential that we look to authentic sources for information and not try to retell their lived experiences through our own perspectives. This aligns with the principle of idea diversity and promotes a deeper understanding of how to use the land sustainably. Additionally, valuing peer feedback allows students to reflect on their own viewpoints, fostering a collaborative learning environment where multiple ideas can coexist and enhance the community's overall knowledge base.
 Encouraging students to tackle real ideas and authentic problems within their own community, rather than focusing on a random city, significantly enhances engagement and relevance. This approach allows them to apply their learning directly to their surroundings, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility. By addressing local challenges, students can explore sustainable practices that impact their lives and the lives of those around them, leading to meaningful contributions and a deeper understanding of community dynamics. This alignment with local issues promotes both motivation and practical knowledge application. Further, having students think of ideas and how to enhance and work with Indigenous communities could be a great way to get them more involved with learning how to preserve the land and be more cautious




 Through an approach such as this one, students have to take ownership of their own learning and their contributions to the broader community. Having students then present their findings and ideas to the class or other small groups in a seminar type of formation in the class. -
- Contributor 31: I like the suggestion of annotating sources, and this could work with Grade 4 and 5 students, depending on the source.  I am thinking of starting with something simple and then moving to more expert sources as we progress, and as the students find them.  (One of the students is already coming to chat with me at recess about Stanley Meyer, who he says invented a hydrogen car and died mysteriously.  I am not sure how 'mysteries' like this will fit into this work but there is probably a place for critically analyzing them!)
To start I might create a note like this, which has a copy of the text from this website 
Knowledge Forum has an annotation feature, which I am showing in this screenshot:

Hopefully you can see how some text is highlighted near the bottom and there is space for an annotation.
We will use other sources as well but they can't all be pasted into a note like this, particularly if they are from hard copy books or even digital books.  
I am thinking that annotation could support this facet of the Proto-to-Systemic KB principles: 

I also think the students could work in a view where they cite the reading material and use it to improve designs, like we do in this course.  
I would love to hear any suggestions about how to structure the annotation process or about any possible scaffolds to support reading for design, or constructive use of authoritative sources with this age group.
Thanks for the inspiration!

Label: suggest demographic based activities
Quotes:
- Contributor 8: In order to make a consideration for pedagogical approaches for sustainability, the designs should, above all, promote a long-term, flexible and reliable educational practices. The ways of approaching these sustainable goals in pedagogy could include the following:

 Adopting cultural inclusive currila.    this could be done by ensuring that the content in the curriculum is culturally accomodative inrorder to promote inclusivity and equity. This is important since diverse students get a sense of belonging by klnowing they are seen and felt through the rep[resentation of their norms in the content taught.This would promte longterm engagement.

- Contributor 18: The AI-powered generative feedback option on KF suggested I deepen connections, consider broader implications, and integrating course concepts further. Here is my attempt:
Echo chambers and mental fatigue limit knowledge building by reducing exposure to diverse ideas and draining cognitive energy. Personally, I’ve noticed doomscrolling impacts my creativity and deep and critical thinking skills. An algorithm that challenges these patterns would encourage deeper engagement and shared responsibility for improving communal knowledge.
In terms of broader implications, an algorithm that promotes    could fundamentally change how we interact in digital spaces, aligning with    by giving users more control over their knowledge landscape. Addressing burnout through a scoping review could also create more inclusive and sustainable knowledge-building environments, helping individuals overcome barriers like mental fatigue by building the body of knowledge around it together.

Label: propose ai feedback on learning reports
Quotes:
- Contributor 29: On the citation dashboard, the system can be improved in terms of feedback, for example, after generating the students' learning reports, the AI tool can automatically generate some feedback to the students to let students know their process in the class. ShirleyInstead of merely linking to sources, we could introduce a shared learning space where users can interact with AI feedback by annotating it and contributing their own insights or research. This approach would allow users to engage actively with information, fostering a continuous process of collective improvement. Additionally, incorporating customizable templates or checklists for different types of responses would provide a scaffolded framework, empowering users to take ownership of their learning and critically evaluate the completeness of their answers, promoting deeper epistemic engagement. -

Label: highlight collaboration in research projects
Quotes:
- Contributor 6: In some research development projects there would be very intense collaboration going on with computer modelling and analysis. In this context the key struggle might come through as teacher sense-making and data interpretation. I think it is key that all members in the group including the teachers should have basic statistical knowledge in order to collaborate and sustain a quality discourse on important topics. 
The harsh reality is that computer science people are comparably fluid in their job market but if someone is willing to stay and contribute it will be good to keep them. In this way not only they get job security, the team dynamic is also sustained and the ideas could keep flowing.

Label: discuss cultural context
Quotes:
- Contributor 19: Hi team. I've been thinking about our idea of an AI-facilitated, morphing assessment chart, and I'm developing some reservations and doubts about it. Of course, we were exploring the idea in the context that we all find ourselves in, but—in the spirit of improvable ideas—here are some concerns that I have, in relation to the principles of Knowledge Building: Reading up on the principles of KB once more, it looks like there is an emphasis not only on the epistemic agency of students charting their own learning course, but also about co-designing the analytics (and, by extension, some of the assessment) of their work. The notion of a rigid achievement chart hidden behind a adaptive lens is perhaps not the most intuitive.
   This second question of mine is perhaps a bit of a perpendicular reading of the KB principle, but I can't help but see a contradiction with the notion of community knowledge being informed by a generalist AI, trained on massive, globally proliferatted data. Would the AI be giving similar advice to students, regardless of their local (cultural, etc.) context? If so, does that take away from the community-level knowledge building?
Anyway, those are some of my thoughts on the matter! I'm sure I'll feel differently after a bit more thought, I was just in a critical mood today, I think!

Quotes:
- Contributor 15: One idea I have is for everyone to be paired in groups of 2 in the area that they are interested in learning about. They can do an interview style where they ask questions of one another. Then the bigger interest group can get together and each pair shares what they learned from the other person. If this group is big (8-10 people), they can divide into two bigger groups. This way, everyone is able to contribute to the collective knowledge of the whole. They then can take the information of what they heard and spend time bringing it back to their original group (the group they are building the city with) and share some big ideas that they had taken away. There are multiple exit tickets available. One can be that they are prepared to have something they share to their original group.

Label: emphasize role play and discussion
Quotes:
- Contributor 37: Interest-based team: Students are grouped by their interest in different sustainable components (e.g., energy, transportation, greenery). This approach encourages students to take ownership of their learning and embodies Democratizing Knowledge, promoting equity and shared responsibility in discussions. Tracking Loop/intergroup session: By presenting designs to other groups, students receive feedback that helps them view their projects from diverse angles, intergroup feedback session encourages students to reflect and iterate on their designs based on shared insights. After receiving feedback, groups refine their designs by integrating new insights, demonstrating   a process where students go beyond initial understandings to develop more sophisticated solutions.  Role-play: Assign one student per group as the advisor who rotates between groups. This student provides guidance based on a shared sustainability framework, ensuring each design supports the city’s overall sustainability goals. Advisors can also collect insights from each group to bring back to their original teams, creating a bridge for idea sharing. Group discussion: Within each group, students discuss and challenge each other’s viewpoints, which encourages the refinement of ideas and deeper understanding through collective dialogue.

Label: propose music integration in pe for motivation
Quotes:
- Contributor 2: Main problem: students are having a hard time staying engaged and have trouble finding motivation to complete and interact with the course content.
Solutions
1. Part of my research for the MT program at OISE looks at increasing student motivation and engagement specifically in Physical Education classes via the use of music integration. I believe that by using music in the class while facilitating games or exercises for your students can greatly increase their motivation and make the class more fun. This increases their engagement especially if they are listening to music that they like. Think of it like going to the gym to workout most people go to workout and listen to music at the same time.
2. Another way to improve student engagement and motivation would be to incorporate gamified learning. Students can begin to learn by playing games that aim to touch on the learning goal for that period. Students can be offered points or rewards for adopting sustainable behaviours or solving problems. This can foster friendly and healthy competition and promote fun in learning new things
3. Another method to increase student engagement is through relationship building. Teachers need to actively try to engage with students and make efforts to get to know them so that they know how to best guide each student on their learning journey. Taking the time to get to know students is acccessible and sustainable to all and goes a long way :)
We also think that this problem relates to this facet . This is because we believe that one of the key factors to improving student engagement and motivation is to build strong relationships with students and safe classroom environments. This will help students feel comfortable in their learning environment and more welcome in the classroom.

Quotes:
- Contributor 22: Chu: My experience with the AI tool is that I was encouraged to elaborate on my opinions and connect my points to the KB principles in a broad view/meta discourse. I think the AI tool is very helpful to refine my writings and ideas, however the potential harm of depending too much on the tool is that I might get into the rabbit hole of questioning my thoughts and stands and this behaviour might not be helpful to sustain the class discourse in a way. My suggestion is applying usage limit to one time and let students read other people's opinions in class.   KF could help foster collaboration by pointing me to other notes, e.g. this note is 80% similar to your idea please talk to them, or this note expressed an opposite view please read it Shirley: We need an embedded support feature (like a 'Help' or 'Contact Support' button) that allows for quick reporting of technical difficulties.

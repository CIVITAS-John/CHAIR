You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: suggesting ai-based jargon translation, seeking ai-driven jargon translation
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both concern the desire for AI-based translation, with the first concept focusing on suggesting it and the second concept focusing on seeking it.
Criteria: Participants suggest and seek AI-based jargon translation to facilitate communication between sub-groups.
Phrase: Seeking AI-based jargon translation.

2.
Concepts: struggles with initial ai use, human-effort(negative): learning curve
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both concern the challenges faced when initially using AI, with the first concept focusing on struggles and the second concept focusing on negative feelings about the learning curve.
Criteria: Participants struggle with the initial use of AI due to a steep learning curve, leading to negative feelings.
Phrase: Struggling with AI's learning curve.

3.
Concepts: criticizing ai limitations, critiquing ai limitations and implementation limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both concern expressing dissatisfaction with AI's limitations, with the first concept focusing on criticizing and the second concept focusing on critiquing.
Criteria: Users criticize and critique AI's limitations and implementation limitations in AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Criticizing AI limitations.

4.
Concepts: sharing ai debugging experiences, describing ai's debugging success
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both concern the positive aspects of AI debugging, with the first concept focusing on sharing experiences and the second concept focusing on describing success.
Criteria: Users share and describe their positive experiences with AI debugging, highlighting the human-AI collaboration.
Phrase: Sharing AI debugging success.

5.
Concepts: uses ai for error resolution, confirming ai error resolution
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both concern the use of AI for error resolution, with the first concept focusing on using AI and the second concept focusing on confirming its effectiveness.

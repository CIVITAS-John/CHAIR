Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...

1. P16: ï¼‹1
2. P10: May I ask what "+1" means?
3. P11: It means I feel the same way.
4. P13: +1 means having the same opinion
5. P13: emmmm
6. P13: You can check Baidu
7. P10: Oh, got it, thanks.
8. P2: +1
9. P14: Some things inside the beaker also require payment.
10. P17: I'll take another look.
11. P4: No problem at all.

Here is a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research on how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

---
* Summary
A conversation about the meaning of "+1" in the online community, where members clarify and explain the term to each other.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do community members negotiate meaning and establish common ground? How do they use digital affordances to facilitate communication and collaboration? What role do power dynamics and social norms play in shaping the community's emergence?

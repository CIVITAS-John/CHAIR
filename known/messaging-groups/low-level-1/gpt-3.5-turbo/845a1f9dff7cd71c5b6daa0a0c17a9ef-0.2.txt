1. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken.
8. P14: [Image]
9. P14: What do you mean?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top. 233333
11. P14: The condensed liquid won't flow back, right?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh, I see.
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year.
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be about electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay.
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok

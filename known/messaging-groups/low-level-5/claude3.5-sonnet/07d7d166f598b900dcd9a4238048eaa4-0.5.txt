1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: expressing respect for expertise; making specific feature requests; demonstrating subject knowledge; contributing to product development
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: prioritizing development tasks; communicating development strategy; managing user expectations
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: planning future user engagement; demonstrating responsiveness to feedback; showing commitment to user input
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: expressing gratitude; acknowledging designer efforts; maintaining positive community atmosphere
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: greeting community members; seeking download information; demonstrating interest in multiple platforms
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: locating resources independently; expressing gratitude; closing communication loop
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

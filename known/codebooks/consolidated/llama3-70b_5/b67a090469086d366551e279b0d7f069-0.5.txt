You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: envisioning ai as a guide, envision human-ai collaboration
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the participant's vision for the role of AI in their work, with AI as a guide implying a collaborative relationship.
Criteria: Participants envision AI-driven interfaces that augment human capabilities through collaboration.
Phrase: Envision AI-guided collaboration.

2.
Concepts: advocate for improvement, envisions iterative feedback
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the participant's desire for ongoing refinement and improvement of LLM-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants propose improvements and value iterative feedback for refining LLM-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Advocate for iterative refinement.

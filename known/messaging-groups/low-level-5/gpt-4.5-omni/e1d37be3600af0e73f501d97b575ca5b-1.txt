You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: describe planned simulated experiment assessment; detail planned features; align with educational enhancements
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: praise idea; provide positive feedback; support feature inclusion
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: notify community of consultation plan; indicate collaborative approach; reinforce participatory design
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Preliminary phrases: consult teachers on textbook conventions; seek expert input; align design with educational standards
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: provide visual aid for clarification; confirm understanding; ensure accurate user feedback
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: affirm common use of old style; confirm designer query; support communal knowledge sharing
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation shows a dynamic exchange primarily between Designer-1 and users, particularly User-4234. Designer-1 introduces the plan for a simulated experiment assessment feature in the electricity module. User-4232 praises the idea, reinforcing positive community feedback. Designer-1 then outlines a collaborative consultation plan with the group, specifically engaging teachers for technical validation on circuit diagram styles. The exchange includes detailed discussions about diagram styles, indicating participatory design. Designer-1 keeps the community updated about ongoing work and future updates, receiving feedback and suggestions from User-4234, demonstrating an open, iterative design process.

Notes: The designers emphasize participatory design by consulting with users and teachers, incorporating their feedback into the development process. User feedback is valued, promoting a sense of ownership and contribution among community members. The frequent updates and acknowledgment of feedback highlight an active and engaged online community, fostering an environment for co-creation and collaboration. The discussion of circuit diagram styles reveals attention to educational standards and usability, crucial for the Physics Lab's educational tools. The iterative approach and gratitude expressed by designers likely enhance user satisfaction and participation, crucial elements for the community's emergence and growth.

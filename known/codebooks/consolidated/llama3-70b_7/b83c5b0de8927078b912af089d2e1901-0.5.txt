You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Phrase: Seeking validation for design choices.

2.
Concepts: acknowledge perspective, acknowledge user support and feedback
Relationship: The concepts are related in that acknowledging user support and feedback is a way to acknowledge a perspective or opinion.
Criteria: Designers or users acknowledge a perspective or opinion, and designers appreciate or acknowledge user support or feedback.
Phrase: Acknowledging user perspectives and feedback.

3.
Concepts: prioritizing user feedback, prioritizing refinement and optimization
Relationship: The concepts are related in that prioritizing user feedback informs the prioritization of refinement and optimization.

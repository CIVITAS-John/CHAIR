You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: analyzing the problem
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

2.
Label: testing phase
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

3.
Label: confirmation the developer's whole argument
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

4.
Label: reach a conclusion for the solution based on user's response
Quotes:

- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

7.
Label: user manual inquiry
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software
- User: Is there a user manual?

8.
Label: inquire about update timeline

16.
Label: connecting to community
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

17.
Label: offer a solution
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1. designer feedback solicitation, user-driven design feedback.
- Instances where designers actively seek input, suggestions, or feedback from users to enhance the software.
- Instances encompassing direct user contributions, including feedback, suggestions, or comments that influence software design, updates, or modifications, as well as designers' reactions to such feedback.

1.
Relationship: Parallel and inclusive. Both sub-codes revolve around the interaction between designers and users, specifically focusing on the influence of user feedback on design processes. The broader sub-code encompasses not only the solicitation but also the implementation of feedback.
Criteria: Instances involving both the solicitation and incorporation of user feedback, suggestions, or comments that directly influence the design, updates, or modifications of the software, including designers' reactions and adaptations to such inputs.

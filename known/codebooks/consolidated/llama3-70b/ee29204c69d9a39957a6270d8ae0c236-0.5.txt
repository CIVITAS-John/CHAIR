You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: seeking community input
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

2.
Label: seeking context
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?
- Designer: Does the class have internet?
- User: PC version?

3.
Label: transparent developer discussion*
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

4.
Label: user suggestion
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

5.
Label: elicit feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

6.
Label: user experience feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

7.
Label: acknowledging community needs
Quotes:

13.
Label: feedback
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- User: Updated
- User: Indeed

14.
Label: insufficient data
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.

16.
Label: expression of interest
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

17.
Label: compliments the software
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

18.
Label: update clarification
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

19.
Label: describe usability features

20.
Label: second the previous response
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

Label: establish identity within the community
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

26.
Label: offers a diagnose for the problem

Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

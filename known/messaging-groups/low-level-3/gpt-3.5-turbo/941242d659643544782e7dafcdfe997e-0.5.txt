You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (19 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
19. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

Thoughts: It seems like the conversation is centered around users seeking guidance on how to use the platform and engaging with the community through experimentation and sharing images. There are also discussions on specific features of the platform and how to make certain functionalities work. The engagement metrics can also be inferred from the level of activity in the community.

Tags for each message:
1. guidance on platform usage; encouraging experimentation; community engagement
2. seeking clarification; community engagement; platform feature
3. community engagement
4. image sharing
5. image sharing
6. engagement metrics; community activity
7. platform usage; community engagement
8. community engagement
9. platform usage
10. platform usage
11. platform feature
12. platform feature
13. platform feature
14. image sharing
15. platform feature
16. community engagement
17. image sharing
18. platform feature
19. community engagement

Summary: The conversation revolves around users seeking guidance on using the platform, engaging with the community through experimentation and image sharing, discussing specific platform features, and trying to make certain functionalities work. The level of community engagement and activity can be inferred from the interactions.

Notes: The designer seems to be observing the community's interactions without actively participating in the discussions. The users are actively seeking help and engaging with each other, indicating a growing and participatory online community around Physics Lab.

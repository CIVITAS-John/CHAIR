You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: invite user input on development priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

2.
Label: foster a positive community atmosphere
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

3.
Label: gather feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

4.

- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

19.
Label: confirm professional role
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

20.
Label: expressed educational need
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

21.
Label: explore accessibility considerations for diverse users
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

22.
Label: prompt community engagement
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

23.
Label: user 4230 suggests features for mechanical waves and vibrations
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

24.
Label: greet community
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

25.
Label: designer 1 organizes workflow
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

26.
Label: express complexity of updates
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

Label: confirm professional identity
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

31.
Label: plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:

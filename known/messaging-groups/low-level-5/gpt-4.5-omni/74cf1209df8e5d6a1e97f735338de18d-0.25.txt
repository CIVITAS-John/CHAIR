You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: user 4230 pays homage to experts; user 4230 makes a request; user 4230 suggests features; user 4230 engages in participatory design
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 prioritizes development tasks; designer 1 outlines development sequence; designer 1 responds to user request; designer 1 manages expectations
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 plans to gather opinions; designer 1 acknowledges memory limitations; designer 1 emphasizes iterative design; designer 1 engages community
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: user 4230 expresses gratitude; user 4230 acknowledges hard work; user 4230 shows appreciation; user 4230 maintains positive interaction
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: user 4231 greets the community; user 4231 uses emoji; user 4231 asks for download information; user 4231 engages with the community
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: user 4231 finds information; user 4231 thanks the community; user 4231 acknowledges group files; user 4231 resolves their query
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: I will focus on understanding how the community's interactions contribute to the development and enhancement of Physics Lab. I will look for evidence of participatory design, user engagement, and how feedback is incorporated into the design process. Key questions include: How do users influence design decisions? How do designers manage and prioritize user feedback? How does the community support each other in using the platform?

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Summary: This conversation appears to be an early stage of the Physics Lab online community, where users and designers are introducing themselves and discussing the development process. The designers are providing updates on the software release and soliciting feedback from users. Users are inquiring about downloading the software and expressing gratitude. The tone is polite and collaborative, with a focus on building a community around Physics Lab.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the designers are setting the tone for the community by apologizing for late-night disturbances and expressing gratitude. The users are also demonstrating a sense of community by using polite expressions and emotional emojis. I'm curious to see how this community will evolve and how the designers will continue to engage with users.

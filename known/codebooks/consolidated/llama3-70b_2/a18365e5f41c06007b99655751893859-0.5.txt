You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: expresses clear task intentions, defining clear ai-assisted tasks
- Participants clearly express their task intentions to AI.
- Users define tasks clearly when using AI-driven interfaces and communicate their needs to AI.

2.
Concepts: clarifying task requirements, refining instructions for clarity
- Participants clarify requirements by providing more detailed information to AI and refine task requests.
- Participants refine their instructions or requests to ensure clarity and accuracy, emphasizing iterative refinement.

3.
Concepts: note ai limitations
- Participants note AI's misunderstandings and incomplete outputs.
- Participants note and describe AI limitations.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: expresses clear task intentions, defining clear ai-assisted tasks
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both describe the process of clearly communicating task intentions to AI, with the first concept focusing on expression and the second concept focusing on definition.
Criteria: Participants clearly express and define their task intentions when using AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Clearly defining task intentions

2.
Concepts: clarifying task requirements, refining instructions for clarity
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both describe the process of refining task requests to ensure clarity, with the first concept focusing on clarifying requirements and the second concept focusing on iterative refinement.
Criteria: Participants clarify and refine their task requests to ensure accuracy and understanding by AI.
Phrase: Refining task requests

3.
Concepts: note ai limitations
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants acknowledge and describe the limitations of AI in understanding and completing tasks.
Phrase: Acknowledging AI limitations

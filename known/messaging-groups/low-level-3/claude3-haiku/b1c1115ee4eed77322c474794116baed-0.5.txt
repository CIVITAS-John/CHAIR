Summary of previous conversation: The conversation started with a discussion about the educational level of the Physics Lab application, with one participant mentioning that they have been using it since high school. This led to a discussion about various electronic components, such as MOSFETs, and the designer's interaction with the community. The conversation then shifted to the use of scientific equipment, such as test tubes, and their application in chemistry experiments. Participants shared their perspectives on the advantages and limitations of different equipment, as well as the potential issues with condensation and liquid flow. The designer also shared their thoughts on the development timeline and the focus on exam-oriented content, acknowledging the challenges of simulating complex chemistry experiments. The discussion also touched on the potential for non-standard operations, the limitations of current chemistry software, and the opportunity for a comprehensive and free chemistry simulation software.

8. P2: Hehe
9. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
10. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
11. Designer: The question is
12. Designer: Where does the light come from?
13. P11: What about light?
14. Designer: Are you shining a light bulb on a photosensitive resistor?
15. P2: Touch by hand
16. P14: I think there's no problem
17. Designer: Then it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
18. P2: With Xiaodeng
19. Designer: Microtransactions...
20. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
21. P2: ï¼Ÿ
22. P14: [Image 245]
23. Designer: Let's talk about it later
24. Designer: Can watch ads even without money
25. Designer: The practice of a conscience game
26. P1: Put up ads
27. Designer: Hmm.
28. P2: It doesn't conduct electricity when you touch it
29. Designer: Oh
30. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (...)
31. P11: ðŸ˜‚
32. P11: Just wanted to say
33. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but I simply don't know how to top up
34. P11: Can also adapt to 3D Touch
35. Designer: Can you top up directly on the app store?

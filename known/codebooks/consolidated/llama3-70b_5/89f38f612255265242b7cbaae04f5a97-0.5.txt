You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1.
Concepts: envisioning ai as a peer programmer, advocating for ai-enhanced pair programming
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as envisioning AI as a peer programmer is a prerequisite for advocating for AI-enhanced pair programming, as one needs to recognize AI's potential as a programmer to advocate for its use in pair programming.
Criteria: Interviewees envision AI as a peer programmer and advocate for AI-enhanced pair programming by discussing its potential benefits and applications.
Phrase: Envisioning AI as a collaborative programmer.

2.
Concepts: acknowledging a learning curve, recognizing complexity of ai interface
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as recognizing the complexity of the AI interface is a reason for acknowledging a learning curve, as the complexity of the interface necessitates a gradual learning process.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge a learning curve with AI by recognizing the complexity of the AI interface and the need for a gradual learning process.
Phrase: Acknowledging the need for AI interface familiarization.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Relationship: The two concepts are related in that they both describe the value participants place on AI's assistance in different aspects of modeling, with equation formulation being a specific task and model building being a broader process.
Criteria: Participants value AI's support in formulating equations and building models.
Phrase: Valuing AI-driven modeling support.

2.
Concepts: appreciating ai's design, appreciating user-friendly ai communication
Relationship: The two concepts are related in that they both describe participants' positive reactions to AI's design and communication style, with design referring to the overall aesthetic and user-friendly communication referring to the language and interaction style.

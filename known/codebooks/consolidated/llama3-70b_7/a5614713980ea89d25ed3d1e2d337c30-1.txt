You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: integrating ai-generated code, integrates ai generated code fully
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as integrating AI-generated code fully implies a complete adoption of AI-generated code into one's workflow.
Criteria: Users fully integrate AI-generated code into their models or existing work.
Phrase: Integrates AI-generated code fully.

2.
Concepts: uses ai for task completion, using ai-generated code selectively
Relationship: The two concepts are complementary, as using AI-generated code selectively is a way to use AI for task completion.
Criteria: Users utilize AI-generated code to complete tasks efficiently, selectively incorporating it into their workflow.
Phrase: Uses AI-generated code selectively.

3.
Concepts: appreciating ai autocomplete, appreciates ai-provided comments, appreciating ai translation
Relationship: The three concepts share a common theme of appreciating AI's assistance in coding tasks.
Criteria: Users value AI's ability to autocomplete code, provide comments, and translate models, making coding easier.
Phrase: Appreciates AI-assisted coding.

4.
Concepts: viewing ai as an outside observer that can catch errors, advocating for ai-assisted peer programming
Relationship: The two concepts are connected, as AI's ability to catch errors makes it a valuable partner in peer programming.
Criteria: Users view AI as a reliable observer that can identify errors and advocate for collaborative coding with AI.
Phrase: Advocates for AI-assisted peer programming.

5.
Concepts: recognizes ai error detection, values ai's error resolution capabilities
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as recognizing AI's error detection abilities implies valuing its error resolution capabilities.
Criteria: Users acknowledge AI's ability to detect errors and appreciate its capabilities in resolving them.
Phrase: Values AI's error resolution.

6.
Concepts: discusses error reporting, seeking ai help with troubleshooting through error message copying
Relationship: The two concepts are connected, as discussing error reporting naturally leads to seeking AI assistance in troubleshooting.
Criteria: Users discuss error management and seek AI help in resolving issues by copying error messages.
Phrase: Seeks AI assistance in error troubleshooting.

7.
Concepts: practice and iteration, engages in iterative development with ai responses
Relationship: The two concepts are complementary, as practicing and iterating imply engaging in iterative development with AI responses.
Criteria: Users engage in iterative development, refining their code through step-by-step building and seeking AI assistance.
Phrase: Engages in iterative development with AI.

8.
Concepts: notes lack of debugging skills, experiences debugging difficulties
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as lacking debugging skills naturally leads to experiencing difficulties in debugging.
Criteria: Users struggle with debugging due to lacking skills or experience.
Phrase: Experiences debugging difficulties.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

3.
Label: product gap
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

* social interactions
* community engagement
=> community and social interactions

# Reflection
- **More categories for merging:** There might be potential to merge "support and technology updates" with "technical responses" as they both deal with technical aspects and updates. Additionally, "engagement and communication strategies" could potentially merge with "community and social interactions" to form a broader category about community engagement and communication.
- **Over-merged categories:** The category "feedback and discussion" might be too broad as it combines feedback on features, general user feedback, and discussions which might need separate attention.
- **Naming inaccuracies:** The name "educational development" might be too broad and could be more specific to reflect the focus on enhancement and integration within the educational context of the Physics Lab's online community.

Considering these reflections, the final merging plan can be adjusted for clarity and specificity.

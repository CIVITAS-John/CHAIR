You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---

Thoughts: Analyzing these messages involves understanding how community members interact with each other and the platform, how they use external resources, and how they express needs and solutions. From a learning sciences perspective, it's crucial to identify how knowledge sharing and problem-solving occur in this online community. Human-computer interaction insights can be gleaned by noting how users interact with the platform and each other through digital means (e.g., images, direct messages). Participatory design elements are evident in how users discuss and suggest modifications or report issues, potentially influencing future design changes.

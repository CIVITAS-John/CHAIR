1. 大家好～开发计划、PC 下载地址都在群公告里
---
2. 如果有什么建议和需求欢迎提出来
---
3. 先膜拜一下大神，再提一点小需求。能不能做机械波机械振动的动态演示，例如横波纵波的传播，波的叠加，波的衍射、干涉。还有光学的实验，很希望有光具座、单缝、双缝、偏振片啊这种，可以演示光学实验～
---
4. 嗯……我们应该会优先完成电学，然后是磁学，然后是其他部分【
---
5. 开始力学之前会再集中征求意见～不然怕自己记不住
---
6. 好的好的～辛苦辛苦了

7. [Emoji]大家好，请问PC / 交互式电子白板版本的Physics Lab在哪里可以下载到呢
---
8. 看到群文件了，谢谢

1. Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
---
2. If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
---
3. First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

4. Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
---
5. Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
---
6. Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
---
7. [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
---
8. I saw the group files, thank you.

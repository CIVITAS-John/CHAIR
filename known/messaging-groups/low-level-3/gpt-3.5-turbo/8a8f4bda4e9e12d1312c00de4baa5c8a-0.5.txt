You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer: Done.
Preliminary tags: task completion; designer's action
2. P5: Good ðŸ˜‚
Preliminary tags: positive feedback; emoji use
3. P8: @Designer  can we have an admin here?
Preliminary tags: user request; community management
4. P13: Are all the members in this group top students?
Preliminary tags: community demographics; group characteristics
5. P14: Except me.
Preliminary tags: self deprecation; group membership
6. P13: ï¼‹1
Preliminary tags: agreement; alignment with previous comment
7. P15: Plus one
8. P16: ï¼‹1
9. P10: What does "+1" mean?
10. P11: It means "me too".

Thoughts: When analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, consider looking at how users interact with the designer, the community dynamics and management, group characteristics, communication patterns, and language understanding. How do these aspects contribute to the emergence of Physics Lab's online community? How do users engage with each other and the platform features provided by the designer?

Tags for each message:
1. task completion; designer's action; platform development
2. positive feedback; emoji use; social interaction
3. user request; community management; platform features
4. community demographics; group characteristics; user inquiry
5. self deprecation; group membership; user engagement
6. agreement; alignment with previous comment; social interaction
7. social interaction; agreement; community engagement
8. social interaction; agreement; community participation
9. language understanding; communication clarification; user inquiry
10. language understanding; communication explanation; user engagement

Summary: The conversation includes interactions between users and the designer, requests for community management features, discussions on group demographics, user engagement through self-deprecation and agreement, and clarification of communication symbols like "+1". These interactions and discussions shed light on the emergent nature of Physics Lab's online community.

Notes: The users' engagement with each other and the platform features provided by the designer seems crucial in shaping the online community. The dynamics of communication, social interactions, and user roles within the community are worth exploring further to understand the community's emergence in Physics Lab.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation begins with a user asking for help, and the designers provide assistance by sharing a download link for the software. They also invite user feedback and share plans for updating features. Throughout the conversation, users express excitement and approval through emojis and provide feedback on desired features. The designers demonstrate a commitment to participatory design by involving users in the development process and considering their suggestions. The conversation also reveals the designers' focus on creating an intuitive software that can be used without additional instructions.
1. User-4235: Can you also include mechanics experiments?
Preliminary phrases: requesting inclusion of mechanics experiments
2. Designer-1: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary phrases: providing information on bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
3. Designer-1: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
Preliminary phrases: expressing commitment to further development; acknowledging need for more time
4. User-4232: Oh, this is nice
5. Designer-1: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
6. User-4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
7. Designer-1: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application
8. User-4234: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji 2-80]
9. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
10. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
11. Designer-1: Hmm.
12. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
13. User-4232: Indeed
14. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
15. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
16. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
17. User-4232: This idea is really good
18. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
19. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
20. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
21. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

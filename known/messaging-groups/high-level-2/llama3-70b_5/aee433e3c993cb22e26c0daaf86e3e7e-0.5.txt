Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

Here is a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research on how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

---
* Summary
A conversation between a designer and a community member (P4229) about uploading a high-definition avatar, with a brief exchange about the community member's profession as a teacher.

* Plan
This conversation can be analyzed from multiple theoretical angles, including learning sciences (e.g., how does the community support teacher professional development?), human-computer interaction (e.g., how does the platform's design facilitate or hinder user interactions?), and participatory design (e.g., how do users contribute to the design and development of the platform?). Guiding questions include: How do users negotiate technical issues in the platform? How do users' professional roles influence their interactions in the community? How do users contribute to the development of the platform's design and features?

# Technical Issues
## Avatar Upload Issues
Definition: Issues related to uploading avatars, including technical difficulties and platform limitations.

Definition: References to users' professional roles or occupations, including teachers, designers, and others.
- "Are you a teacher?"
- "Yes."

# Platform Features
## Avatar Customization
Definition: Discussions about customizing or modifying avatars, including features and limitations.
- "How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?"
- "I'll upload one now..."

# User Interactions
## Request for Help
Definition: Users seeking assistance or guidance from others in the community.

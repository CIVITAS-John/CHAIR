You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: share potential solutions
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

2.
Label: encourage future discussion or questions
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

3.
Label: compliment
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: This idea is really good

4.
Label: give a suggestion about taking the development slow
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

5.
Label: design question
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

6.
Label: confirmation/agreement of collaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

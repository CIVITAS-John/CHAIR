You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
4. User-4233: How to download?
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
6. Designer-2: Group sharing.
7. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

* Summary
In this interaction, various participants, including designers and users of the Physics Lab platform, engage in a conversation about updates, features, and user support. The designers provide information on the latest version and upcoming features, while also soliciting feedback and requests from users. Users inquire about downloading procedures and express their engagement through emojis.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction, we will explore themes related to communication dynamics, user engagement, and participatory design elements within the Physics Lab online community. From the learning sciences perspective, we can examine how the communication supports user learning and engagement. In human-computer interaction, we can focus on usability and accessibility of information. From a participatory design viewpoint, we will look into how users are involved in the development process and how their feedback is integrated. Key questions include: How are the designers facilitating user participation? What channels are used for user support and feedback? How are updates and new features communicated to the community?

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for it.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

4. {Repeat the input 4}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 4, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 4}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 4}

~~~
1. Label: limitations and constraints, team and prototype limitations
- Discussions or mentions of limitations or restrictions in the simulation, software, or platform.
- Acknowledgments or discussions about limitations or constraints in the current prototype.

2. Label: feature preview, new feature introduction
- Designers preview or hint at upcoming features or updates.
- Introducing or outlining new features or content

3. Label: platform enhancement, platform evolution
- Discussion focuses on enhancing or improving specific platforms.
- Discussions or mentions of differences, versions, or updates between or within platforms.

4. Label: community building
- A statement that fosters or promotes a sense of community or togetherness, or efforts to build or foster a sense of community or collaboration.
- Designers or users share knowledge, experiences, and support related to the software.

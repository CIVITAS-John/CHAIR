You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: valuing ai's amplification of human capabilities, emphasizes enhancing human capability through ai
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as valuing AI's amplification of human capabilities implies an emphasis on enhancing human capability through AI.
Criteria: Participants value and emphasize the role of AI in augmenting human capabilities.
Phrase: Emphasizing AI-driven human capability enhancement.

2.
Concepts: refining model setup, refining task definitions
Relationship: The concepts are sequentially related, as refining model setup is a precursor to refining task definitions, which together lead to better AI assistance.
Criteria: Participants refine model setup and task definitions to optimize AI assistance.
Phrase: Refining AI-assisted task setup.

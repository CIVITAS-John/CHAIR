You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
Tags should be descriptive of the event and its context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary tags: simulated experiment assessment; experimental details; functionality
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary tags: positive feedback; design approval
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary tags: collaborative design; community involvement; decision making
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary tags: consulting teachers; circuit diagrams; textbook analysis
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary tags: image sharing; circuit diagram example; design inspiration
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary tags: confirmation; common practice; circuit diagram style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Thoughts: In this conversation, I want to explore how the designers and users interact and collaborate to develop Physics Lab's online community. I'll analyze the conversation through the lens of participatory design, human-computer interaction, and learning sciences. I'll look for instances of collaborative design, community involvement, and decision making. I'll also examine how the designers and users negotiate and refine ideas, and how they use visual aids like images to facilitate communication.

Summary: This conversation is centered around the development of Physics Lab's online community, particularly the design of a simulated experiment assessment feature. The designers and users engage in collaborative design, discussing and refining ideas, sharing images, and negotiating design decisions. The conversation reveals a participatory design approach, where the designers involve the community in the design process and value their input.

Notes: The conversation highlights the importance of community involvement in the design process. The designers actively seek feedback and input from the users, and the users provide valuable insights and suggestions. The use of images as a means of communication and design inspiration is also noteworthy. The conversation suggests that the designers prioritize simplicity and usability in their design decisions.

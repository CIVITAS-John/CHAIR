Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P14: Except me
2. P13: ＋1
3. P15: +1 again
4. P16: ＋1
5. P10: May I ask what "+1" means?
6. P11: It means I feel the same way.
7. P13: +1 means having the same opinion
8. P13: emmmm
9. P13: You can check Baidu

* Summary
The conversation revolves around a common online interaction where several participants express agreement by posting "+1." One participant (P10) seeks clarification on the meaning of "+1," and others (P11, P13) explain that it signifies agreement or having the same opinion. P13 also suggests using Baidu for further clarification.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we should consider how community norms and shared understandings develop within online interactions. From a learning sciences perspective, we can explore how members learn from each other and establish common language. From a human-computer interaction (HCI) angle, we can examine how the interface supports or hinders these interactions. Participatory design can help us understand how community members contribute to and shape the community’s practices and norms. Guiding questions include: How do participants establish and communicate shared meanings? What role do explanations and external resources (like Baidu) play in community learning? How does the design of the platform facilitate or obstruct these interactions?

# Community Norms
## Shared Language
Definition: The use of specific phrases or symbols that have a common meaning within the community.
- "＋1" (P13, P15, P16)
- "It means I feel the same way." (P11)
- "+1 means having the same opinion" (P13)

## Social Learning
Definition: The process by which community members learn from each other through interaction.
- "May I ask what '+1' means?" (P10)
- "It means I feel the same way." (P11)
- "+1 means having the same opinion" (P13)

# Human-Computer Interaction
## Interface Utilization
Definition: How participants use the features of the platform to communicate and interact.
- The use of "+1" to quickly express agreement (P13, P15, P16)
- The question about the meaning of "+1" indicating a gap in understanding (P10)
- Suggestion to "check Baidu" as a resource (P13)

## Information Seeking
Definition: How participants look for and share information within the community.
- "May I ask what '+1' means?" (P10)
- "You can check Baidu" (P13)
- Explanation provided by multiple participants (P11, P13)

# Participatory Design
## Community Contribution
Definition: How community members contribute to the development of norms and practices.
- P13 explaining the meaning of "+1" (P13)
- P11 providing additional clarification (P11)
- P13 suggesting an external resource (P13)

## Norm Establishment
Definition: The process by which norms are established and reinforced within the community.
- Multiple participants using "+1" to express agreement (P13, P15, P16)
- Clarification of what "+1" means (P11, P13)
- External resource suggestion reinforcing the norm (P13)

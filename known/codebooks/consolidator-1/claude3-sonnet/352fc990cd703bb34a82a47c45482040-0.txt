You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is merged from multiple ones. Write a single label and criteria to apply across quotes. Both should be clear and generalizable, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Thoughts:
* The codes seem to cover various aspects related to the emergence of the Physics Lab online community, including design decisions, technical considerations, community interactions, learning goals, and business/monetization strategies.
* To categorize them, I will group codes based on common themes like design process, technical factors, community dynamics, learning objectives, and business/monetization aspects.
* I will aim to create clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, while avoiding unnecessary specifics or examples.
* The categories will be informed by relevant theoretical lenses like learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

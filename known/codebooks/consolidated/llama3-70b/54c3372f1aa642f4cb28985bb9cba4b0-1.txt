You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: providing rationales, justifying design choices
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related as providing rationales is a way to justify design choices.
Criteria: Designers or users provide reasons for their requests or decisions.
Phrase: Provide justification

2.
Concepts: transparency, maintaining development transparency
Relationship: The two concepts are interchangeable, as maintaining transparency implies development transparency.
Criteria: Designers provide clear information about the development process or timeline.
Phrase: Provide transparency

3.
Concepts: recognizing constraints, consider hardware limitations
Relationship: Recognizing constraints is an aspect of considering hardware limitations.
Criteria: Users and designers take into account the limitations of hardware devices when making decisions.
Phrase: Acknowledge limitations

4.
Concepts: discussing development plans
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as discussing plans implies acknowledging user feedback.
Criteria: Designers share information about future development and consider user input.
Phrase: Discuss plans

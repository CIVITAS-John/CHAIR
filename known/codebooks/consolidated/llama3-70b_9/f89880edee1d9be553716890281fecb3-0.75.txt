You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

- The practice of asking multiple, sequential questions to refine AI outputs.

2.
Concepts: immediate feedback
- The importance and value of receiving real-time responses and assistance from the LLM-driven interface.
- The benefit of receiving quick responses and solutions from the AI.
- Valuing the immediate feedback provided by the LLM-driven interface.

3.
Concepts: system support
- The participant discusses the need for system support or reminders to facilitate learning and productivity.
- Suggesting that the system should provide support for professionals who learn in fragmented time blocks.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: iterative questions
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as the interviewee's perception of the importance of iterative questioning is linked to the actual practice of asking multiple, sequential questions to refine AI outputs.
Criteria: Participants value and engage in asking multiple, sequential questions to refine AI outputs.
Phrase: "Asking iterative questions to refine AI outputs"

2.
Concepts: immediate feedback
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as the importance and value of receiving real-time responses and assistance are linked to the benefits of receiving quick responses and solutions from the AI.
Criteria: Participants value and receive immediate feedback and assistance from the LLM-driven interface.
Phrase: "Receiving immediate feedback from the AI"

3.
Concepts: system support
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as the need for system support or reminders is linked to facilitating learning and productivity, particularly for professionals who learn in fragmented time blocks.
Criteria: Participants require system support or reminders to facilitate learning and productivity.
Phrase: "Requiring system support for learning and productivity"

4.
Concepts: learning pathways
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as the interviewee's perception of AI's potential to create structured and effective learning paths is linked to the potential for AI to design and facilitate personalized learning experiences.
Criteria: Participants perceive AI's potential to create structured and effective learning paths.
Phrase: "Designing personalized learning pathways with AI"

5.
Concepts: human-effort: debug
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as the interviewee's investment of human effort to debug and understand errors is linked to the importance of identifying conceptual errors beyond syntax mistakes.
Criteria: Participants invest human effort to debug and understand errors in AI outputs.
Phrase: "Debugging AI outputs with human effort"

6.
Concepts: ai ability (positive): fast iteration
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as AI's ability to quickly iterate and improve is linked to its speed or ability to iterate quickly.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

2. 
Concepts: {Repeat the input 2}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 2, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 2}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: promote participatory design
- Instances where the community contributes to the design and development of the Physics Lab by providing suggestions or feedback that influence the development process.
- Instances where designers seek or consider user input in the design and development process.
- Instances where users are invited to participate in the design process or provide input.
- Instances where users and designers collaboratively discuss features and usability, reflecting a user-centered design approach.
- The involvement of users in the design and development process, contributing their insights and needs.
- Encouragement by designers for users to contribute ideas, feedback, and suggestions for the development of Physics Lab.
- Active involvement of users in the design process to ensure the product meets their needs and preferences.
- The involvement of users in the design process to ensure the product meets their needs and preferences.
- Instances where users and designers collaboratively discuss or work on design improvements.

2.
Concepts: iterative development
- Instances where designers discuss updates, new features, or bug fixes.
- The process of repeatedly refining and improving a product based on feedback and testing.
- The process of continuously improving the product based on feedback and testing.
- Instances where the design process is described as iterative, with ongoing optimizations and updates.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: promote participatory design
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected, emphasizing the collaborative and user-centered aspects of design, where users and designers work together to shape the development process.
Criteria: Designers and users collaboratively contribute to the design and development process through suggestions, feedback, and discussions to ensure the product meets user needs and preferences.
Phrase: Collaborate on design decisions

2.
Concepts: iterative development
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected, highlighting the cyclical and ongoing nature of the development process, where feedback and testing inform continuous improvements.
Criteria: Designers repeatedly refine and improve the product through ongoing updates, optimizations, and bug fixes based on feedback and testing.
Phrase: Refine through iterative cycles

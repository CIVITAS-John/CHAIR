Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1

1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

* Summary
The conversation is between users of Physics Lab and the designers of the platform. User-4231 asks for the location of the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab, and User-4232 asks how to use the PC version. The designers provide information about the upcoming update and the system requirements for using the PC version.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will use the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. We will look for evidence of how users are learning to use Physics Lab, how they are interacting with the platform, and how they are participating in the design process. We will also consider the role of the designers in facilitating this process.

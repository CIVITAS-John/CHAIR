You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)

30. P14: Finally talking about something I can understand
31. P2: You don't understand brushless motors
32. P2: It's hard to make it work
33. P4: Making a motor is quite simple if you follow my method @Designer 
34. P14: [Image 1-168]
35. P2: What if it burns out?
36. P4: Just power it up and play a rotating animation, that's it ðŸ˜‚
37. P2: Do you still need an algorithm?
38. P4: ðŸ˜‚ Simple and done
39. P2: Algorithms are not simple
40. P2: igdt can also be added @Designer 
41. P13: [Image 1-175]
42. P13: Are you all fake?
43. P13: Are you from outer space?
44. P13: I don't understand
45. P2: Transistors can also be used
46. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do that in a normal experiment...
47. P11: ðŸ˜‚ That's in electronic circuits
48. P11: I don't understand either
49. P2: In the CPU
50. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned a bit when I took an elective course on circuits
51. P2: Add a polarized capacitor
52. P2: I learned it all by myself
53. P11: That's great, if you have a passion for it
54. P14: @P11 Do they still separate arts and science tracks now?
55. P2: no
56. P11: We don't separate arts and science tracks anymore
57. P14: [Image 1-191]
58. P14: ...let me get admitted first and then we'll talk
59. P2: I'm still in 2nd year of middle school
60. P11: Keep it up
61. P13: First year of high school
62. P2: What about MOSFETs?
63. P2: @Designer 
64. P17: [Image 1-198]
65. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
66. P2: +1

Thoughts: In analyzing the conversation, I will look for instances of knowledge sharing, problem-solving, and community bonding, as these are key aspects of the emergence of the Physics Lab online community. I will also pay attention to how the Designer interacts with the community, as this can provide insights into participatory design and human-computer interaction principles. Additionally, I will consider the role of humor and brief expressions in maintaining a positive atmosphere and fostering social bonds.

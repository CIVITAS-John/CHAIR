You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: experiencing frustration with ai, experiencing limitations with ai automation
Relationship: Causal (experiencing limitations leads to frustration)
Criteria: Users experience frustration due to limitations or errors with AI-driven interfaces or automation.
Phrase: Encounter AI limitations and frustrations.

2.
Concepts: relying on ai-generated code under time pressure, human-ai: complete reliance due to time constraints
Relationship: Conditional (reliance is conditional on time pressure)
Criteria: Users rely on AI-generated code when facing time constraints and work within limitations.
Phrase: Rely on AI-generated code under time pressure.

3.
Concepts: translate code with ai assistance, translating models with ai assistance
Relationship: Associative (AI assistance is associated with translation)
Criteria: Participants use AI to translate code from other languages to NetLogo or develop equations for agent-based models.
Phrase: Translate code with AI assistance.

4.
Concepts: saving time with ai, time-saving tool
Relationship: Causal (using AI leads to time-saving)
Criteria: Users perceive AI as a tool that saves time in various programming tasks.
Phrase: Save time with AI.

5.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: share personal experience; offer practical advice; illustrate user interface navigation
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: express agreement; affirm designerâ€™s insights; strengthen collaborative dialogue
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: propose new features; emphasize practical utility; advocate for enhanced user experience
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: confirm feature implementation; express willingness to improve; engage user in development process
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquire about classroom technology; assess user environment; gather information for software development
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: share concerns about internet access; recount negative experiences; emphasize importance of secure environments
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

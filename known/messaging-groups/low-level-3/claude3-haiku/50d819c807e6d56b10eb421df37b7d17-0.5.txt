You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: The conversation so far seems to revolve around the community members trying to understand and engage with the gameplay mechanics of the Physics Lab application. There are questions about specific features and functionality, as well as attempts to share information and provide guidance to each other. The designer's initial message about "playing by conducting experiments" suggests that the core gameplay loop involves some form of experimentation, which the community members are now trying to figure out. The tags so far indicate themes of community participation, gameplay questions and explanations, and image sharing. To further analyze the emergence of this online community, it would be helpful to identify more specific patterns in the types of questions asked, the way information is shared, and how the community members interact with each other and the designer over time.

Summary: The conversation so far shows an online community of Physics Lab users actively engaging with the gameplay and trying to understand its mechanics. The community members are asking questions, sharing information, and providing guidance to each other, while the designer is also participating to some extent. The key themes emerging are community participation, gameplay questions and explanations, and image sharing as the community members try to figure out how to effectively use the application.

Notes: The community seems to be in the early stages of formation, with members exploring the core gameplay loop and functionality of Physics Lab. The designer's initial message about "playing by conducting experiments" suggests that the application is centered around some form of experimentation, which the community is now trying to understand and master. The back-and-forth between the community members and the designer indicates an interactive dynamic, where the community is actively seeking information and the designer is responding, albeit somewhat minimally so far. As the conversation progresses, it will be interesting to see how the community members continue to engage with each other and the designer, and how the community's understanding and use of the application evolves over time.

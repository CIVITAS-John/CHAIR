Summary of previous conversation: The conversation continues to revolve around the participants' shared interest in physics and chemistry, with discussions on superconductors, chemistry experiments, and light-sensitive components. The Designer plays a crucial role in facilitating the conversation, providing insights, and clarifying concepts. The participants engage in active questioning, seeking clarification, and sharing knowledge. The conversation is characterized by a sense of community, with participants validating and agreeing with each other.
1. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but I simply don't know how to top up
Preliminary tags: payment; difficulty; user experience
2. P11: Can also adapt to 3D Touch
Preliminary tags: adaptation; innovation; 3d touch
3. Designer: Can you top up directly on the app store?
Preliminary tags: payment; convenience; app store
4. P14: Seems a bit troublesome
5. P2: ……
6. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now
7. P14: After all, just a middle school student
8. Designer: That's true
9. Designer: Then let's watch ads hh
10. P14: Yes, we can
11. P2: What's up with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
12. P2: A middle schooler is even better than you
13. P11: Just hope that ads won't take up too much of the interface
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
15. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
19. Designer: Just asking you to watch ads for points, use points to unlock new content like this
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come hit me along the Ethernet cable
21. P2: I can code
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 280]
24. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is too disgusting
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen is not big, but it's still impressive.
27. P2: It even forces you to click.
28. P2: What's the purpose of the ads for you guys?
29. Designer: Health preservation...
30. Designer: Doing this requires nurturing people...
31. P1: It's free.
32. Designer: In fact, it's the same as receiving money, just that you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay.
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do more of it.
35. Designer: There are some other ways as well.

Thoughts: As I delve into this conversation, I'm struck by the interplay between the Designer and the participants, particularly in relation to payment methods and user experience. I'm intrigued by the Designer's role in facilitating the conversation and providing insights. I'll be exploring how the Designer's comments shape the discussion and how the participants respond. I'll also examine the power dynamics at play, considering how the Designer's authority influences the conversation. From a learning sciences perspective, I'm interested in how the participants engage with each other and the Designer, seeking clarification and sharing knowledge. I'll investigate how this interaction fosters a sense of community and validates individual contributions.

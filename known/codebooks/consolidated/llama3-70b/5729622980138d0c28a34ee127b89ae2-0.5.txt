You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate label to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {The most representative label for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: help posting, ai-assisted help posts
- Assistance with writing "help" posts for user groups.
- The user suggests that the AI could help write "help" posts or summarize the situation.

2.
Concepts: appreciating timely feedback, need for accurate and immediate feedback
- The participant appreciates immediate feedback from the LLM-driven interface.
- The participant recognizes the need for a feedback loop between the user and the AI, to improve the AI's performance, and expresses the need for immediate feedback.

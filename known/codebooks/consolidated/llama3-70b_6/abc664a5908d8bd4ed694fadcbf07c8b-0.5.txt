You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (3 in total):

Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

- Participants recognize, critique, and identify AI limitations in code generation and output.
- Participants acknowledge AI limitations in complex programming and error resolution.

2.
Concepts: notes unclear error messages, encounter unclear error messages
- Participants note and express confusion caused by unclear error messages.
- Participants encounter incorrect or unclear error messages from the AI.

3.
Concepts: highlights time-saving benefits, valuing time-saving benefits
- The interviewee highlights the benefit of AI in saving time and effort.
- The interviewee values the potential time-saving benefits of using an AI, and sees it as a way to increase productivity.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: recognizes ai limitations, acknowledges ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as recognizing AI limitations implies acknowledging them.
Criteria: Participants identify and accept AI limitations in code generation and complex programming.
Phrase: Acknowledge AI limitations

2.
Concepts: notes unclear error messages, encounter unclear error messages
Relationship: The concepts are synonymous, as noting unclear error messages implies encountering them.
Criteria: Participants experience and express confusion due to unclear error messages from the AI.
Phrase: Encounter unclear error messages

3.
Concepts: highlights time-saving benefits, valuing time-saving benefits
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as highlighting time-saving benefits implies valuing them.
Criteria: Interviewees emphasize and appreciate the potential of AI to save time and increase productivity.
Phrase: Value time-saving benefits

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation from multiple angles, I will focus on identifying tags related to community norms and language use, as well as knowledge sharing and help-seeking behaviors. I will also look for signs of uncertainty, agreement, and social dynamics within the group.

Tags for each message (11 in total):
1. agreement; affirmation; norm establishment
2. seeking clarification; community norms; language use  
3. explanation; community norms; language use
4. explanation; community norms; language use
5. uncertainty; hedging
6. advice; external reference; knowledge sharing
7. acknowledgment; gratitude
8. agreement; affirmation; norm establishment
9. off-topic; resource management
10. observation; browsing
11. reassurance; acknowledgment

Summary: The conversation starts with P16 using "+1" as a form of agreement or affirmation, which prompts P10 to seek clarification on the meaning of this expression. P11 and P13 provide explanations, establishing it as a community norm or language use. P13 expresses uncertainty before suggesting to search on Baidu for more information, showing knowledge sharing and external reference. P10 acknowledges the explanations with gratitude. P2 then uses "+1" again, reinforcing the norm. The conversation takes an off-topic turn with P14 mentioning paid resources and P17 stating they are just browsing. P4 provides reassurance that there is no problem.

Notes: The conversation reveals the emergence of community norms and language use, particularly around the "+1" expression. Participants engage in help-seeking and knowledge sharing behaviors, as well as establishing and reinforcing norms through agreement and affirmation. There are also signs of uncertainty and hedging, as well as off-topic comments and observations. Overall, the conversation seems to be a mix of norm establishment, knowledge sharing, and social dynamics within the group.

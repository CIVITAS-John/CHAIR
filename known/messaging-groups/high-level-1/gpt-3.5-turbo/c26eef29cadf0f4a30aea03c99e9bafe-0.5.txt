Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the community's emergence.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...

1. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken.
8. P14: [Image]
9. P14: What do you mean?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top. 233333
11. P14: The condensed liquid won't flow back, right?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh, I see.
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year.
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be about electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay.
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
32. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
33. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
34. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
35. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
36. P11: Hey, good idea.
37. P2: Hehe.
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
39. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
40. Designer: The question is,
41. Designer: Where does the light come from?
42. P11: What about light?
43. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
44. P2: Touch it with your hand.
45. P14: I think there's no problem.
46. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
47. P2: And a small light.
48. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
50. P2: ？
51. P14: [Image]
52. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
53. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
54. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
55. P1: Let's put up some ads.
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P14: 
58. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
59. Designer: Oh.
60. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).
61. P11: 23333
62. P11: I was just about to say.
63. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
64. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
65. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?
66. P14: It seems a bit troublesome.
67. P2: ……
68. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now.
69. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.
70. Designer: That's true.
71. Designer: Let's just click on ads, hh.
72. P14: Yes, that's fine.
73. P14: 
74. P2: What's wrong with middle schoolers [Emoji]
75. P2: A middle schooler is better than you.
76. P11: I just hope that ads won't take up too much space on the interface.
77. P11: Young man, you misunderstood.
78. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method.
79. P2: Oh.
80. P2: ～
81. Designer: The ads won't be permanent.
82. Designer: We just want you to click on ads to earn points, and then use the points to unlock new content.
83. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come and hit me along the network cable.
84. P2: I know how to code.
85. P11: Okay!
86. P2: [Emoji]
87. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is really annoying.
88. P2: Indeed
89. Designer: The screen isn't big and it's still got psoriasis.
90. P2: It even forces you to click.
91. P2: What do you need ads for, @Designer 
92. Designer: Health...
93. Designer: Doing this requires hiring people...
94. P1: It's free.
95. Designer: Actually, it's similar to charging money, but if you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay...
96. P2: Oh.
97. Designer: Do more of it.
98. Designer: There are some other ways as well.
99. P8: The points wall is okay.
100. P8: @Designer I think it's okay.
101. P14: I also think it's great.
102. Designer: Actually, you can learn that mini program.
103. Designer: Creating questions, reviewing questions, and answering questions.
104. P14: What do you mean?
105. P14: [Image]
106. P17: Brain Out.
107. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
108. P18: Just downloaded it.
109. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10

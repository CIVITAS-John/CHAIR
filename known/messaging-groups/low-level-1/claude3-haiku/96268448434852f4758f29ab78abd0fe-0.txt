Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation demonstrates the emergence of an online community where members engage in knowledge-sharing, problem-solving, and social interactions related to physics and space-related topics. The participants discuss various concepts such as the representation of celestial bodies, artificial satellite orbits, gravitational waves, and binary star systems. The conversation also includes social interactions, such as asking for information, providing explanations, and expressing opinions.
1. P14: I can't remember if it's 78 or 79.
2. P14: [Image]
3. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
4. P11: Look it up online, this is not something that can be solved in a few words. @P2 
5. P2: Can we add a motor? @Designer 
6. P14: I think I should focus on doing mathematics.
7. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
8. Designer: We will be relatively simple, practical (close to the exam), and affordable.
9. P11: 2333
10. P11: Ask the group owner.
11. Designer: After all, it's not specifically about astronomy.
12. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
13. P2: [Image]
14. P2: From what I know currently.
15. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in the Physics Lab?
16. Designer: Motor simulation is more complicated, and it depends on the load.
17. Designer: Calculated it...
18. P2: How was it calculated?
19. P11: Okay.
20. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
21. P11: [Image]
22. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but an atomized model.
23. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
24. P1: Server?
25. P11: Hahaha
26. Designer: Standalone.
27. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
28. Designer: Two types of motors.
29. P1: Are you going to the server?
30. P2: Brushed motor.

Summary: The conversation demonstrates the emergence of an online community where members engage in knowledge-sharing, problem-solving, and social interactions related to physics and space-related topics. The participants discuss various concepts and design considerations for a project, while also engaging in social interactions such as asking for information, providing explanations, and expressing opinions. The community members take on different roles, such as the designer, the problem-solver, and the information seeker, and they collaborate to address the challenges and questions that arise.

Notes: The conversation covers a range of topics related to physics and space, including the representation of celestial bodies, artificial satellite orbits, gravitational waves, and binary star systems. The participants also discuss design considerations for a project, such as the use of motors, the complexity of simulations, and the technical limitations of the available tools. The social interactions within the community demonstrate a supportive and collaborative environment, where members are willing to share their knowledge, provide explanations, and work together to solve problems.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. P4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. P4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community, where a designer interacts with community members, discussing the development plan, uploading high-definition avatars, and gathering suggestions for future features, particularly in mechanics and optics.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do community members influence the development plan? How does the designer facilitate participation and gather feedback? What are the community's needs and expectations from the Physics Lab platform?

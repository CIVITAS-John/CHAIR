You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: tags a user; inquires about technical functionality; seeks to improve user experience; addresses image quality concerns
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: inquires about platform compatibility; shows interest in software format; engages with technical aspects
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: confirms action; prepares to upload content; inquires about user’s professional role; acknowledges and responds to user request
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: confirms professional identity; identifies as a teacher; reveals user background and potential use case
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: To approach this conversation, I need to consider how participants interact in a digital environment, focusing on community-building behaviors, technical support interactions, and the exchange of educational resources. Key aspects to look for include how users seek and share information, their roles and identities, and how designers respond to user needs. Questions to guide my analysis include: How do users express their needs and suggestions? How do designers facilitate and respond to these interactions? What roles do different participants play in the community?

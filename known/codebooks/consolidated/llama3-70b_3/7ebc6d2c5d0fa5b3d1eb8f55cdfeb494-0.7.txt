You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

2.
Label: suggesting future developments based on user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

3.
Label: balance user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

4.
Label: indicating the possibility of future demonstration experiments
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

5.
Label: balancing automatic and manual features
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

6.
Label: talk about limitation of the solution
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

8.
Label: suggests adding export/import function for convenience in educational settings
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

9.
Label: contextualizing response
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

10.
Label: affirming the previous statement
Quotes:
- User: Indeed

11.
Label: highlights feature for long term stability and ease of adding components
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

12.
Label: update on ios review status
Quotes:
- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

13.
Label: affirm user's point

18.
Label: suggesting feature improvements
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

19.
Label: showcasing user needs
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

20.
Label: provide status information
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

21.
Label: striving for quality

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
2. {Repeat the input 2}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 2}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 2}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 2}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1. software usage, platform utilization
Relationship: Inclusive (software usage is a specific type of platform utilization)
Criteria: References to using, operating, or interacting with software or platforms, including inquiries about availability, access, or usability.
Label: Platform Engagement

2. priority and planning, prioritization of development tasks
Relationship: Overlapping (prioritization is a key aspect of planning)
Criteria: References to prioritizing, ranking, or organizing tasks or goals, particularly in the context of development.
Label: Task Prioritization

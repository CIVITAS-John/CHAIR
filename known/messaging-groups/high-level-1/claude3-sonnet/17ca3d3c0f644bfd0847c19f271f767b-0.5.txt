Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. P11: I will consider the impedance.
2. P11: Updated to the latest version.
3. P11: Thank you.
4. P12: My sister just found a group, the group owner is crazy, keeps sending red packets, hurry up and grab them at 695176754.
5. P5: ã€‚
6. P5: @Designer 
7. Designer: Done.
8. P5: Good ðŸ˜‚
9. P8: @Designer  can we have an admin here?
10. P13: Are all the members in this group top students?
11. P14: Except me.
12. P13: ï¼‹1

Here's a codebook to analyze factors that could contribute to the emergence of Physics Lab's online community:

---
## Community Building
Definition: Efforts to build and strengthen the online community through interactions, activities, or moderation.
- Example quote 1: "P8: @Designer can we have an admin here?"
- Example quote 2: "P13: Are all the members in this group top students?"
- Example quote 3: "P14: Except me."

## Off-Topic Conversation
Definition: Conversations that deviate from the main purpose of the group and are not directly related to the topic of physics or the lab.
- Example quote 1: "P12: My sister just found a group, the group owner is crazy, keeps sending red packets, hurry up and grab them at 695176754."
- Example quote 2: "P5: ã€‚"
- Example quote 3: "P5: Good ðŸ˜‚"

## Acknowledgments and Gratitude
Definition: Expressions of appreciation, thanks, or acknowledgment towards others in the group.
- Example quote 1: "P11: Thank you."
- Example quote 2: "Designer: Done."

## Task Updates
Definition: Updates or announcements related to tasks, assignments, or activities within the physics lab or group.
- Example quote 1: "P11: I will consider the impedance."
- Example quote 2: "P11: Updated to the latest version."

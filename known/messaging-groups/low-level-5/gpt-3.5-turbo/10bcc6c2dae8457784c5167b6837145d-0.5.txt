You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (19 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
19. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: outlines plans to introduce a function for simulated experiment assessment in electricity experiments; mentions specific details like zero adjustment for enhanced user experience
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: expresses approval and enthusiasm for the proposed idea of simulated experiment assessment
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: commits to consulting the community when initiating new features or experiments
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: seeks input from teachers in the group regarding circuit diagram conventions in current textbooks
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: confirms a specific type of circuit diagram intersection based on user feedback
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirms the prevalence of the old style intersection in circuit diagrams as per user input
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Thoughts: When analyzing these interactions, consider how the designers are incorporating user feedback into their design decisions, how they are involving the community in the development process, and how they are addressing technical challenges. Look at the users' responses in terms of their engagement with the proposed features and their expectations for updates. Consider the collaborative nature of the conversation and how it reflects principles of participatory design.
Interpretation phrases for each item:

15. Shares an image without accompanying text; 
16. Expresses gratitude for the community's support and pledges improvement; 
17. Inquires about the timing of an upcoming update with an accompanying emoji; 
18. Confirms the schedule for upcoming updates across different platforms; 
19. Teases a significant upcoming update.
Summary: The designers are actively engaging with the online community to gather feedback, make design decisions, and provide updates on the project. Users are supportive of new features and express expectations for updates, while also providing insights into design preferences and technical considerations.
Notes: The iterative process of design and feedback is evident in the conversation, with designers soliciting input, making adjustments, and communicating progress. The collaborative and participatory nature of the community's involvement highlights the value of user engagement in shaping the development of Physics Lab.

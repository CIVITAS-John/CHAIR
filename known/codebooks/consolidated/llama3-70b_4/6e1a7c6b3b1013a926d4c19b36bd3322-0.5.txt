You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: experimental simulations in electricity
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

23.
Label: give an opinion on why still makes the future perfection
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

28.
Label: pay respect to experts
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

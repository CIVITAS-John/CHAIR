You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: [Image] This one, right?
- User: Left side

2.
Label: emphasizing quality control
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

3.
Label: offering manual adjustment options
Quotes:
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

4.
Label: acknowledging the value of craftsmanship
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

Label: setting expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

9.
Label: expressing desire for convenience
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

15.
Label: informing about release
Quotes:
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group

16.
Label: set development scope
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

Label: reciprocating social interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

18.
Label: component adjustments
Quotes:

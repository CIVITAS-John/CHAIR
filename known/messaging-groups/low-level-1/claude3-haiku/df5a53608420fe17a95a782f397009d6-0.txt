Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation demonstrates the emergence of an online community where members engage in knowledge-sharing, problem-solving, and social interactions related to physics and space-related topics. The participants take on different roles, such as the designer, the problem-solver, and the information seeker, and they collaborate to address the challenges and questions that arise. The community members express varying levels of understanding and confusion, and they provide advice and explanations to help each other.
1. P14: ...Let me get admitted first.
2. P2: I'm still in the second year of junior high school.
3. P11: Keep it up.
4. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
5. P2: What about MOSFETs?
6. P2: @Designer 
7. P17: [Image]
8. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
9. P2: +1

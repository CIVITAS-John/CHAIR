You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- Categories that can be merged further: 
  * Support Systems could be merged with Social Interaction and UX
  * Learning and Pedagogy could be split into two separate categories
  * Design and Development could be merged with Human-Computer Interaction and Design
- Categories that are too broad: 
  * Technology and Infrastructure is quite broad and could be split into more specific categories
- Inaccurate naming: 
  * Category names should be more concise and descriptive, e.g., "Support Systems" could be renamed to "Support and Care"

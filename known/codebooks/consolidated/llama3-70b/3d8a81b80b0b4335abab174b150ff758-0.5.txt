You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between sub-codes. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Categories: 
* Social Dynamics
* Learning Interactions

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1.
Relationship: Parallel sub-codes, as they both relate to interactions with teachers but have different focuses.
Criteria: Instances where students engage with teachers for guidance or express gratitude for support.
Label: Teacher-Student Interactions

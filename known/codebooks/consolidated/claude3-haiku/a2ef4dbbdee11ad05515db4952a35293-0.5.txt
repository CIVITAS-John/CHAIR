You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

1. user-centered design, iterative design.
- Discussions where users provide feedback, suggestions, or comments about the Physics Lab software, and the designer's response and incorporation of the community's input.
- The process of continuously refining the Physics Lab software based on user feedback and testing, and the designer's efforts to incorporate the community's input and ideas into the software's development.

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1. User Feedback and Iterative Design
Relationship: The concept of user-centered design is a broader category that includes the more specific concept of iterative design, where the software is continuously refined based on user feedback.
Criteria: Discussions where users provide feedback, suggestions, or comments about the Physics Lab software, and the designer's response and incorporation of the community's input into the iterative design process.
Label: User Feedback and Iterative Design
Category: Participatory Design

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: learning value, engage iteratively for debugging
- A user acknowledges the educational value of engaging with AI during the debugging process, even when incorrect answers are provided.
- Users engage with AI during debugging in an iterative manner, recognizing the value derived from this back-and-forth effort to enhance their learning.

2.
Concepts: dislikes limited ai options, express frustration with ai limitations
- The interviewee expresses frustration regarding the limited options provided by the AI, indicating a desire for more specific capabilities like a "fix" option after errors.
- Users express frustration with the limitations of AI, specifically noting the restricted options available when encountering errors.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. 
Concepts: learning value, engage iteratively for debugging
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as the acknowledgment of educational value supports the behavior of engaging iteratively with AI, which enhances the debugging process.
Criteria: Users acknowledge the educational value of interacting with AI during debugging by engaging iteratively to improve their understanding, even when encountering incorrect responses.
Phrase: Acknowledge educational value through iterative engagement.

2. 
Concepts: dislikes limited ai options, express frustration with ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as the expression of frustration stems directly from the dissatisfaction with the limited options provided by AI during the troubleshooting process.
Criteria: Users express frustration with the limited options available in AI systems, articulating a desire for more tailored capabilities when encountering errors.
Phrase: Express frustration over AI limitations.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: appreciates the ability to run ai generated code
Quotes:
- E04: Oh and you can run it. That's cool. (interviewer's observation) E04 reads the AI output and decides to copy & paste it although he could also run it.

2.
Label: emphasizes oral tradition
Quotes:
- E01: So my observation is that a critical, critical 10%, maybe more, maybe a lot more of knowledge that you need to do your job in software is only contained in oral tradition. It's, it is not documented anywhere.  (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on knowledge in pieces - how they are generated and sustained.

3.
Label: envisioning collaborative ai learning
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

4.
Label: discussing the importance of code complexity and quality for maintainability
Quotes:
- E01: You know, so in point of fact, I considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can. So that when I come back to it later, I could figure out why it, why it's not working anymore. (interviewer's observation) Discussion on code complexity & quality. Plain / not-tricky code's advantage in maintenance.

5.
Label: showing confidence in personal ideas
Quotes:
- E04: "Can train-perceptron be turned into a reporter" (interviewer's observation) E04 uses "can you fix with my own idea".

6.
Label: recognizing the value of having a responsive tool to support their workflow
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

7.
Label: feels stuck due to less clear error messages
Quotes:
- E04: It seems like a bug because I feel like all my parentheses are closed and all of my arguments and syntax are correct. (interviewer's observation) A less-clear error message makes E04 stuck.

8.
Label: knowledge dependent ai usage
Quotes:
- E04: To me, it seems like you need to have a certain degree of expertise to understand where the errors are and how to fix them. Because otherwise it's like you're going down this path where you're blindly following the ChatGPT and you have no idea what's going on. For less experienced people, I wouldn't like that because it could put you in a worse situation. (interviewer's observation) Requires expertise to understand errors and debug them. Risks to blindly follow ChatGPT, esp. for less experienced people.

9.
Label: values chat gpt's suggestions for code improvement
Quotes:
- E01: So if I'm writing long NetLogo code now, I'd probably have ChatGPT just open on the side. And I write a block of code and then I handed ChatGPT. Say, could I have done this better? And it would go, yeah, you could rearrange this like that. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could help E01 optimize his code.

10.
Label: seek help
Quotes:
- E04: Interesting because it's trying to plot the name, which I know is wrong, but I'm just trying to remember how to... (interviewer's observation) E04 reasons through the responses of ChatGPT.

- E04: "how can I plot the output of this model?" (interviewer's observation) E04 was prompted to follow-up with ChatGPT.
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E04 was prompted to copy and paste error messages to ChatGPT.

11.
Label: desiring more control over ai interaction
Quotes:
- E04: So, I guess that's kind of annoying because I didn't really want it to explain here, but that was the only option that I had. (interviewer's observation) E04 wants the "fix" option right after the errors are identified.

12.
Label: doubts ai's capability
Quotes:
- E01: "can you verify that no more names are reserved words in NetLogo?" I don't know if it can do that. (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug after the third iteration, he asks ChatGPT to verify the code and produce no more bug. Unsure if it could do that.

13.
Label: e04 desires automatic ai code integration
Quotes:
- E04: I really liked how, like the code that it generates, if you could just kind of place that into the model automatically.  (interviewer's observation) The capability to put into the model automatically.

14.
Label: and the line number
Quotes:
- E01: I have I found with with playing with with ChatGPT. And I was something at Python, I think I tried to give it the code. And I tried to run it generated error. And then I would go back to the next prompt and ChatGPT. And I go, that code is good. But it generates the following error. And I list the error online on this line, and I'd quote the line. And I say, Can you fix that?  (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug in the generated code, he refers to his previous practice with asking ChatGPT to debug with the code, the error message, and the line number. Interviewer did what E01 said.

15.
Label: establishes a clear process for building ab ms
Quotes:
- E04: I just like being able to kind of, like, iteratively build it. The thing that I always do when I create a model is I do, like, the initial command. I'll set up and go here. I'll go ahead and after I kind of set up the buttons, I'll put the functions behind them back here in the interface. (interviewer's observation) E04 creates the code skeleton before asking ChatGPT. He has a clear idea & established process of building ABMs.

16.
Label: users appreciate the ai's adherence to best practices and its potential as a teaching tool
Quotes:
- E04: I don't know if I've ever tried 4. I guess it would be 3.5. (interviewer's observation) Only used ChatGPT 3.5 before

17.
Label: peer-programming vs. do your own work
Quotes:
- E01: I'm an advocate of peer programming. It's about 10 times more efficient than single programming... If a person's programming, if you're programming it by yourself and you come to something you don't understand, you could spend a long time at that stoplight. (interviewer's observation) E01's positive opinions on peer programming with a hint that AI could play the role.

18.
Label: compares to other languages
Quotes:
- E01: And I got to admit like these days, NetLogo is the only language I use that does not have a smart editor.

Label: emphasizes collective problem solving
Quotes:
- E01: I call it hive feedback system, where if anyone in the world learns a new fact, or like, Oh, if you're a nurse, here's the word. If you're a transcriptionist, here's the word. If anybody learns it, then it goes into the system into the cloud. And now the cloud won't make that mistake anymore. And then the developer doesn't have to solve all these problems, because all the users solve their own problems.

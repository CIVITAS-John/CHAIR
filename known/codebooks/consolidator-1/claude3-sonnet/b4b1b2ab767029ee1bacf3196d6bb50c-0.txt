You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is merged from multiple ones. Write a single label and criteria to apply across quotes. Both should be clear and generalizable, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Thoughts:
* To categorize the codes, I will group them based on their relation to key aspects of an online community's emergence, such as design discussions, social interactions, technical inquiries, and constraints/limitations. The categories will be informed by learning sciences (e.g. inquiry, feedback), human-computer interaction (e.g. usability, design) and participatory design (e.g. co-design, constraints).

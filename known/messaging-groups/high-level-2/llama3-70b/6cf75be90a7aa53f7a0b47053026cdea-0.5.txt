Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...

~~~
1. P16: ＋1
2. P10: What does "+1" mean?
3. P11: It means "me too".
4. P13: +1 means the same opinion
5. P13: emmmm
6. P13: You can search on Baidu
7. P10: Oh, I see, thank you.
8. P2: +1
9. P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for.
10. P17: I'm just looking.
11. P4: No problem.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with P16 giving a "+1" which sparks a discussion about what "+1" means. P10 asks for clarification, and P11 and P13 provide explanations. The conversation then diverges into unrelated topics, with P14 mentioning paying for things in a beaker, and P17 and P4 exchanging brief comments.

* Plan
This conversation can be analyzed through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do community members negotiate meaning and clarify understanding? How do they use digital communication tools to facilitate discussion? What roles do individual members play in shaping the conversation?

# Social Negotiation
## Clarification Requests
Definition: Instances where community members ask for clarification or explanation of a concept or term.
- P10: What does "+1" mean?
- P10: Oh, I see, thank you.
- P13: emmmm (implying a need for clarification)

## Providing Explanations
Definition: Instances where community members provide explanations or definitions for a concept or term.
- P11: It means "me too".
- P13: +1 means the same opinion
- P13: You can search on Baidu (implying that the answer can be found through online research)

# Digital Communication
## Digital Symbolism
Definition: Instances where community members use digital symbols or abbreviations to convey meaning.
- P16: ＋1
- P2: +1

# Community Dynamics
## Topic Shifts
Definition: Instances where the conversation topic changes suddenly or abruptly.
- P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for. (shifts the topic from "+1" to beakers)
- P17: I'm just looking. (shifts the topic again)

## Peripheral Participation
Definition: Instances where community members make brief, peripheral comments that do not contribute significantly to the main conversation.
- P17: I'm just looking.
- P4: No problem.

Note: This is just a starting point, and you may need to refine or add codes as you continue to analyze the conversation.

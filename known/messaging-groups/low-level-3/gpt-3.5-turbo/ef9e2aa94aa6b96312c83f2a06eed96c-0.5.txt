You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (11 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
11. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P16: ï¼‹1
Preliminary tags: community agreement; user contribution; social interaction
2. P10: May I ask what "+1" means?
Preliminary tags: community norms; symbol interpretation; user guidance
3. P11: It means I feel the same way.
Preliminary tags: social interaction; symbol interpretation; user clarification
4. P13: +1 means having the same opinion
Preliminary tags: community norms; affirmation; user contribution
5. P13: emmmm
Preliminary tags: hesitation; uncertainty; user behavior
6. P13: You can check Baidu
Preliminary tags: external resource suggestion; information sharing; user guidance
7. P10: Oh, got it, thanks.
8. P2: +1
9. P14: Some things inside the beaker also require payment.
10. P17: I'll take another look.
11. P4: No problem at all.

Thoughts: When analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, consider how community norms and social interactions are being established and maintained within the online community. Look at how users interpret symbols and how designers provide guidance for user understanding. Additionally, explore how users contribute to the community through their behaviors and contributions. 

Tags for each message:
1. community agreement; user contribution; social interaction
2. community norms; symbol interpretation; user guidance
3. social interaction; symbol interpretation; user clarification
4. community norms; affirmation; user contribution
5. hesitation; uncertainty; user behavior
6. external resource suggestion; information sharing; user guidance
7. user gratitude; acknowledgment
8. community agreement; user contribution
9. payment information; user contribution
10. intention to revisit; user behavior
11. user reassurance

Summary: The conversation showcases the establishment of community norms through the interpretation of symbols like "+1" and the clarification of their meanings. Users engage in social interactions by affirming agreement and seeking clarification, while also hesitating and seeking external resources for information. The designer provides guidance and users contribute to the community through their behaviors and contributions.

Notes: The online community seems to be collaborative, with users actively participating in discussions and seeking clarification when needed. The designer's role in providing guidance and maintaining community norms is evident throughout the conversation. Further analysis could delve into how these interactions shape the overall community dynamics and learning processes within Physics Lab.

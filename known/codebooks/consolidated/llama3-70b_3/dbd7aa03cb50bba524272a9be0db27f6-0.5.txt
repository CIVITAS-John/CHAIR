You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

2.
Label: user 4232 identifies gaps in current software
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

3.
Label: encourage user participation
Quotes:
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

4.
Label: indicate user interest in platform specific features

- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

6.
Label: feature update
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

7.
Label: emphasize attention to detail
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

8.

11.
Label: designer 1 personalizes interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

12.

13.
Label: explain limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

14.
Label: align with user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

15.
Label: greeting back
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

16.
Label: planned feature enhancements
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

17.
Label: identify gaps in current functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

18.
Label: inquired about user manual
Quotes:
- User: Is there a user manual?

19.
Label: sought specific version information
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

20.
Label: acknowledged advice
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm.

21.
Label: offer immediate help
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

22.
Label: explain application functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

23.
Label: emphasize the importance of dynamic demonstrations
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

24.
Label: provide status information
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

25.
Label: designer 1 shares development insights
Quotes:

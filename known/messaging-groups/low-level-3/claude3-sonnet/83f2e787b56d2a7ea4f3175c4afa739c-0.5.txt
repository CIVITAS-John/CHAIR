You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (12 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
12. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P11: I will consider the impedance.
Preliminary tags: proposing technical solution; considering impedance
2. P11: Hmm, I just updated to the latest version.
Preliminary tags: updating software; seeking resolution
3. P11: Thank you.
Preliminary tags: expressing gratitude
4. P12: My sister just found a chat group where the group owner has gone crazy and keeps sending out red packets. The group code is 695176754, everyone hurry and grab them.
Preliminary tags: spam message; irrelevant
5. P5: ã€‚
Preliminary tags: unclear message
6. P5: @Designer 
Preliminary tags: calling for attention; seeking support
7. Designer: Done.
8. P5: Good ðŸ˜‚
9. P8: @Designer  we need an admin here.
10. P13: Are all the members in this group top students?
11. P14: Except me.
12. P13: ï¼‹1

Thoughts: To analyze how Physics Lab's online community emerged, I need to look for tags related to community building, interactions between members, roles and norms being established, and the purpose or goals of the community. I should also pay attention to any mentions of the Designer's role or actions in facilitating the community.

Tags for each message (12 in total):
1. proposing technical solution; considering technical details
2. updating software; seeking technical resolution  
3. expressing gratitude
4. spam message; off-topic; irrelevant
5. unclear message
6. calling for attention; seeking support from designer
7. (no tags)
8. expressing positive sentiment
9. requesting community management; seeking admin role
10. inquiring about community composition
11. self-deprecating humor; acknowledging non-elite status  
12. agreeing with previous message; indicating shared experience

Summary: The conversation starts with a technical issue being discussed by P11, who is proposing solutions and seeking help. Then there is an irrelevant spam message from P12. P5 calls for the Designer's attention, possibly about the spam, and the Designer responds. P8 requests an admin role to help manage the community. P13 and P14 have a brief exchange about the skill levels of community members.  

Notes: There are some early signs of community norms and roles emerging, like expressing gratitude, calling on the Designer for support, and requesting moderation. The technical issue suggests the community's purpose is related to using or developing Physics Lab software. P13 and P14's exchange hints at the community comprising a mix of skill levels. Overall, it seems like an online community is just starting to take shape around the Physics Lab software, with the Designer playing a central role in guiding and moderating it.

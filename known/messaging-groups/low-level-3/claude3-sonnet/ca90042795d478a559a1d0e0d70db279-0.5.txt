You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}

Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
Preliminary tags: assessment plans; realism
2. P4232: This is a really good idea
Preliminary tags: positive sentiment
3. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary tags: community involvement
4. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?
[Image 91]
Preliminary tags: design clarification
5. Designer: [Image 92]This one.
Preliminary tags: visual reference
6. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.
Preliminary tags: confirmation; common practice
7. Designer: Um... left or right?
8. Designer: We are working on this.
9. P4234: Left side.
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Keep it simple...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side without crossing.
13. Designer: So, should we use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, and may produce some weird results.
15. Designer: [Image 102]
16. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be updates this week? [Emoji 104]
18. Designer: There will be updates. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer: The update is quite substantial...

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* communication norms
* online community norms and practices 
=> community norms and practices

* community formation dynamics
* community social environment
* community participation
=> community dynamics and participation  

* collaborative knowledge building
* scaffolded learning
=> collaborative and scaffolded learning

* visual communication practices
* design and technology
* technology affordances
=> design, technology and communication

* socio-technical factors
* participatory design approaches
=> socio-technical and participatory design

# Reflection
- The merging covers most of the major themes, though some smaller categories like "socio-technical factors" could potentially be merged into a larger "technology" category.
- The naming tries to be concise while covering the key aspects. "Community norms and practices" is straightforward. "Community dynamics and participation" covers the social aspects of community formation and engagement.
- No obvious over-merging, the categories are still distinct enough.

# Final Merging 
* community norms and practices
* community dynamics and participation
* collaborative and scaffolded learning  
* design, technology and communication
* socio-technical and participatory design

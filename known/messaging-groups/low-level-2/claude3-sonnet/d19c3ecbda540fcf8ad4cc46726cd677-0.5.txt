1. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
2. P4232: This is a really good idea
3. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

5. Designer: [Image]This one.
6. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.
7. Designer: Um... left or right?
8. Designer: We are working on this.
9. P4234: Left side.
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Keep it simple...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side without crossing.
13. Designer: So, should we use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, and may produce some weird results.
15. Designer: [Image]
16. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be updates this week? [Emoji]
18. Designer: There will be updates. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer: The update is quite substantial...

Summary: This conversation revolves around the collaborative development of a simulated experimental assessment function for an educational software/app related to electricity and circuits. The designer shares their plans, seeks feedback and clarification from the community (likely teachers), and provides progress updates. The community members engage by providing encouragement, knowledge-sharing, suggestions, and inquiring about progress. The designer appreciates the support, demonstrates transparency, and aims for consensus in decision-making. Overall, the conversation highlights the emergence of an online community focused on collaborative development, feedback exchange, and shared progress towards a common goal.

Notes: The conversation showcases various aspects of an emerging online community, including collaborative planning, feedback-seeking, knowledge-sharing, decision-making through consensus, progress updates, transparency, and mutual appreciation. The designer actively involves the community members (likely teachers) in the development process, seeking their input and suggestions. The community members engage by providing feedback, recommendations, and inquiries about progress, indicating their investment in the project. The overall tone is positive, with encouragement and appreciation expressed by both parties. The conversation highlights the importance of collaboration, feedback exchange, and shared progress in building an online community around a common goal.

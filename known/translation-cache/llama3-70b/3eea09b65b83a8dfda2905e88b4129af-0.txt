1. 大家好
---
2. 您好：）
---
3. 最近还有其它更新吗？
---
4. [Image]正在准备的更新
---
5. 这个比较复杂，所以要多费点时间……希望这周来得及发布
---
6. 还会有的：万用表；通电螺线管；半导体电容器；支持转换为理想电表（比较方便解题和初中教学）
---
7. 有使用说明书吗
---
8. 您用的过程中遇到什么问题了？
---
9. 我们尽可能设计成不需要额外说明就能用，或者根据反馈会在第一次打开的时候做一些提示
---
10. 主要是学校在建设信息化学校
---
11. 需要这个软件的使用说明
---
12. 哦哦哦，您小窗吧，说一下您大概需要什么
---
13. 这个好，希望可以非常方便的画电路图，另外希望可以有个可以一键隐藏背景方格的功能，方便咱当老师的截图出试卷，现在出电路部分的题目没有一个方便画电路图的软件
---
14. 其实我们在研究的是实物图和电路图的双向转换
---
15. 当然，也会允许手工Editor，但可能稍微晚一点
---
16. 可以把力学实验也弄进去
---
17. 比如你可以连好实物图以后看到对应的电路图，或反之
---
18. 力学要等电磁都搞清楚；还要一段时间
---
19. 哦，这个不错
---
20. 希望年底之前能搞清楚电磁的
---
21. 你们这个软件立体效果很不错
---
22. 双向转换有了，可以直接在应用里做题
---
23. 已经做的有点样子了[Emoji]
---
24. 比如看到电路图去连接实物图，或反之
---
25. 不要求全，应该逐个分类、求精
---
26. 物理主要就做电学和力学；其他方向在高中以前没什么自由实验的空间，以后根据大家的需要可能做一些演示实验，但不会像电学这么开放
---
27. 我自己对化学也有点兴趣
---
28. 后续看看机会合适也搞一个
---
29. 电学这边，打算做一个模拟实验考核的功能；会增加很多实验细节，比如调零（当然只在特定模式下有用，不然平时用起来就麻烦了）
---
30. 这个想法真不错
---
31. 准备做的时候会在群里请教大家
---
32. 请教一下群里的老师：现在教材电路图上的交叉点是用哪一种？

Here are the translations:

---
1. Hello everyone
---

---
2. Hello:)
---

---
3. Are there any other updates recently?
---

---
4. [Image] Updates in preparation
---

---
5. This is a bit complicated, so it'll take some time... hoping to release it this week
---

---
6. There will be: multimeter; electrical coil; semiconductor capacitor; supporting conversion to ideal ammeter (very convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
---

---
7. Is there a user manual?
---

---
8. What problems did you encounter while using it?
---

---
9. We'll design it to be usable without extra explanations, or provide some prompts based on feedback when you open it for the first time
---

---
10. Mainly for schools building information-based schools
---

---
11. Need a user manual for this software
---

---
12. Oh, oh, oh, you're asking about the details, tell me what you need roughly
---

---
13. This is great, hoping to draw circuit diagrams conveniently, and also hoping to have a function to hide the background grid with one click, making it convenient for teachers to take screenshots for exams, currently there's no convenient software for drawing circuit diagrams for exam questions
---

---
14. Actually, we're researching the two-way conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
---

---
15. Of course, we'll also allow manual editing, but maybe a bit later
---

---
16. We can also include mechanics experiments
---

---
17. For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
---

---
18. Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is clear; still need some time
---

---
19. Oh, this is not bad
---

---
20. Hoping to clarify electromagnetism before the end of the year
---

---
21. Your software has a great 3D effect
---

---
22. With two-way conversion, you can do exercises directly in the application
---

---
23. We've already made some progress [Emoji]
---

---
24. For example, seeing the circuit diagram and connecting to the physical diagram, or vice versa
---

---
25. No need to be comprehensive, should be categorized and refined gradually
---

---
26. Physics will mainly focus on electricity and mechanics; other directions won't have much experimental space before high school, but we might do some demonstration experiments later based on everyone's needs
---

---
27. I'm also interested in chemistry myself
---

---
28. We'll see if there's an opportunity to do something about it later
---

---
29. For electricity, we plan to add a simulation experiment assessment function; will increase many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (only useful in specific modes, otherwise it's troublesome to use normally)
---

---
30. This idea is really great
---

---
31. We'll ask for guidance from everyone in the group when we're ready
---

---
32. Asking the teachers in the group: what kind of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks? [Image]

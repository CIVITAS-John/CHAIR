Summary of previous conversation: The conversation explores the development and evolution of the Physics Lab online community. The participants discuss various topics related to physics and chemistry, such as MOSFETs, potassium permanganate, test tubes, and superconductors. The Designer, who is the person responsible for designing and developing Physics Lab, provides insights and guidance throughout the discussion. The conversation also touches on the challenges of creating realistic chemistry software and the focus on the exam perspective in the Physics Lab platform. The participants seem to be interested in exploring ways to improve the Physics Lab community and make it more accessible and comprehensive.
1. P2: What about superconductors?
Preliminary tags: superconductors
2. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
Preliminary tags: computational power; chemistry experiments
3. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
Preliminary tags: free and comprehensive chemistry software
4. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
5. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
6. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
7. P11: Hey, good idea.
8. P2: Hehe.
9. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
10. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
11. Designer: The question is,
12. Designer: Where does the light come from?
13. P11: What about light?
14. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
15. P2: Touch it with your hand.
16. P14: I think there's no problem.
17. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
18. P2: And a small light.
19. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
20. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
21. P2: ï¼Ÿ
22. P14: [Image 245]
23. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
24. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
25. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
26. P1: Let's put up some ads.
27. Designer: Hmm.
28. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
29. Designer: Oh.
30. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).
31. P11: 23333
32. P11: I was just about to say.
33. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
34. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
35. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?

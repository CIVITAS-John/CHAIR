Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation involves members of an online physics community discussing various technical topics related to physics simulations and models. There is a mix of casual conversation, sharing of multimedia resources, seeking and providing information, expressing opinions and reactions, and referring to external knowledge or resources. Some members express confusion or lack of understanding, while others attempt to clarify concepts or suggest alternative approaches. There are instances of disagreement, dismissive comments, and rhetorical questions. The conversation also touches on broader philosophical questions and community norms.
1. P14: ...Let me get admitted first.
2. P2: I'm still in the second year of junior high school.

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation for social interactions and the emergence of the online community, I will look for tags related to self-disclosure, encouragement, seeking information, sharing resources, referring to others, expressing reactions, and engaging with the community norms or dynamics.

Analysis for all 9 messages:
1. self-disclosure, aspiration
2. self-disclosure, age
3. encouragement
4. self-disclosure, age
5. seeking-information, technical-topic
6. referring-to-other, technical-topic
7. sharing-resource, visual
8. seeking-clarification, technical-topic 
9. reaction, agreement

Summary: The conversation involves members disclosing personal information about their ages and educational stages. There is encouragement and support expressed. Members seek information and clarification on technical physics topics like MOSFETs and potassium permanganate. Resources like images are shared. Members refer to each other and express reactions like agreement. The conversation touches on both personal aspects and technical discussions related to the physics community's interests.

Notes: The self-disclosures about age and educational level could help build rapport and a sense of community among members. The encouragement and support could foster a positive environment. Seeking information, sharing resources, and referring to others suggest an active exchange of knowledge and engagement within the community. Expressions of agreement and reactions indicate interaction and responsiveness. Overall, the conversation displays elements of personal connection, knowledge sharing, and community dynamics that could contribute to the emergence of the online physics community.

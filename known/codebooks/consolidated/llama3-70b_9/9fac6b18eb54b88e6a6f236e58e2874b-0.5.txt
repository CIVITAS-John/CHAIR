You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

16.
Label: user 4234 shows interest in development
Quotes:
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

17.
Label: gather detailed requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

18.
Label: the designers are building rapport with users
Quotes:
- Designer: ðŸ˜‚

19.
Label: request specific features
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

20.
Label: open up plans
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

21.
Label: listing updates
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

22.
Label: vague on responses to the feature request
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

23.
Label: suggests new functionality
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

24.
Label: introduce teacher identity with grade-level and number of years
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

25.
Label: enhancing educational value of simulations
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

26.
Label: acknowledging user context
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.
- Designer: ðŸ˜‚

27.
Label: share past incident
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

28.
Label: highlights problem solving capabilities within the application
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

29.
Label: expressing satisfaction with software
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

Label: anticipates android version update for the night
Quotes:
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

31.
Label: providing instructions for using the student power supply
Quotes:
- Designer: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch

32.
Label: considering usefulness and usability
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

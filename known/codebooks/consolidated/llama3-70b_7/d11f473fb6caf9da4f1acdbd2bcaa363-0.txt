You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: prefers teaching others
Quotes:
- E04: So maybe I didn't prove it today, but I feel like I'm pretty competent with NetLogo. (interviewer's observation) Prefers helping others learn NetLogo.

2.
Label: appreciates comprehensible ai responses
Quotes:
- E04: It seems to explain things pretty well, it does not seems to be overly technical. (interviewer's observation) Provides clear, less technical explanations.

3.
Label: randomness
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

4.
Label: parameter clarification
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

5.
Label: uses ai for equation development
Quotes:
- E04: I use it a lot for developing like, equations for specific like, aspects of agent-based models that I create. (interviewer's observation) Helpful for creating equations

6.
Label: ability to ask questions
Quotes:
- E01: If you know how to ask iterative questions, I think it could do pretty well. (interviewer's observation) E01 thinks ChatGPT would do well if one knows how to ask iterative questions.

7.
Label: fragmented learning
Quotes:
- E01: Depending on what you do and how busy you are and the higher ranking people are, the more busy they are, the longer it is between sessions. So you make some notes on little yellow, sticky cinnamon. And then you go back to your administrator job for two months, and then some other project comes up. And then six months later, you come back. Okay, now, where was I? (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on how professionals learn - they learn in fragments, in fragmented time blocks and need support from the system to remind them where they were.

8.
Label: linting features
Quotes:
- E01: So I see this from beginners all the time is they, they just get totally lost. I call it lint program from Unix, you know, it's like it's a little green checkbox looks at you and go, okay, wait, it's just, you've spelled everything correctly, but you have a conceptual error here. If it, if it caught structural problems like that, that would, that would help. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo needs to have linting features that exist in other languages (we are working on that right now).

Label: readability
Quotes:
- E01: You know, so in point of fact, I considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can.

Plain / not-tricky code's advantage in maintenance.

- E04: Oh and you can run it. That's cool. (interviewer's observation) E04 reads the AI output and decides to copy & paste it although he could also run it.

23.
Label: ai ability (negative): error
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

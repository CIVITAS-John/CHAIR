You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

~~~
1. changes in lab components, design updates.
- Announcements or discussions regarding updates to lab components.
- Discussions related to updates, changes, or improvements made to the Physics Lab software, as well as insights into the overall development process of the software.

2. emoji-based engagement indicators, social expression.
- Use of emojis and other minimal responses to indicate engagement and participation in discussions.
- Use of emojis or informal language that adds a personal touch to the interaction, or instances of community members expressing emotions through language, emojis, or non-text elements.

3. user-centered design.
- User-initiated discussions on software features and usability improvements.
- Instances where users express their opinions or suggestions concerning the software's features, performance, and their direct interactions with developers, and instances where user feedback is actively integrated into the software development process.

4. software development.
- Discussing the upcoming release of a new version of the software and its potential impact on user experience.
- Statements about downloading the Physics Lab software and the release of new versions of the software, and mentions of downloading or accessing Physics Lab.

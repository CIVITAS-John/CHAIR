You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: adjustments to component properties
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.

(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

5.
Label: development goals
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa

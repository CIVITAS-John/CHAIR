You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P8: [Image]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.
6. Designer: 
7. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are in the group announcement.
8. Designer: Feel free to share any suggestions and needs.
9. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
10. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
11. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
12. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
13. P4231: [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
14. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.

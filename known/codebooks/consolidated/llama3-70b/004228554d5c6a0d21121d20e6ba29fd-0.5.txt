You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (8 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: intent to simplify, considering simplification
Relationship: Inclusion (considering simplification is a part of expressing intent to simplify)
Criteria: Designer expresses intent to simplify or improve a feature, considering ways to make it more user-friendly.
Label: Intent to Improve Usability

2.
Concepts: inquiry, information inquiry
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts refer to seeking information or clarification)
Criteria: A user asks a question or seeks clarification about a product or resource.
Label: Information Seeking

3.
Concepts: self-rebuttal, counter-self-rebuttal
Relationship: Intersection (self-rebuttal and counter-self-rebuttal are two sides of the same coin, correcting or contradicting one's own previous statement)
Criteria: A user or designer corrects or contradicts their own previous statement, providing an alternative perspective.
Label: Self-Correction

4.

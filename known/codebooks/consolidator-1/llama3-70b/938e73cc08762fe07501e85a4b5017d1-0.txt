You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging? 
Yes, categories 1, 5, and 25 could be merged into a broader category, such as "Contextual Factors" or "Environmental Influences".

- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
Category 28 ("Technical Facets") might be too broad and could be split into "Technical Infrastructure" and "Technical Exploration".

- Is any naming inaccurate?
The name "Physics and Technology Integration" might be misleading, as it implies a stronger connection between physics and technology than the original codes suggest. A more accurate name could be "Domain Knowledge and Technology".

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

3.
Label: theoretically, it should be compatible
Quotes:

- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

5.
Label: downplay formality
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

6.
Label: informs about simulation adjustments
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

7.
Label: gathering user opinions
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

8.

Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

12.
Label: demonstrating subject knowledge
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

13.
Label: acknowledging user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: There will be.
- Designer: Okay.
- Designer: Hmm.

14.

Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm.

18.
Label: designers' responsiveness to diverse user needs and environments
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

19.
Label: illustrating intersection types
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

20.
Label: considering implications of touch interface
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

21.
Label: committing to community consultation
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

22.
Label: express amusement
Quotes:
- Designer: ðŸ˜‚

- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

27.
Label: with frequent updates and a focus on continual improvement
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

28.
Label: highlight outdated technology
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

29.
Label: expressing desire for convenience
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

Label: justify effort
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

31.
Label: promoting categorization and refinement
Quotes:

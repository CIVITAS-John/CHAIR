Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...

1. P4232: Thank you.
2. P8: You're welcome. If you encounter any problems during use, you can directly discuss them in the group.
3. P4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to do everything and ends up being inconvenient to use.
4. Designer: I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to install a virtual machine.
5. Designer: In theory, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from around 2008 onwards).
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been uploaded to the group files, with the following updates:
7. Designer: # New Features
Electronic components will now be damaged after a brief process, rather than immediately. 
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface. 
Support for undoing wire and component creation and deletion. 
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current. 
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.
8. P4232: Suggest adding an exit button function for the PC version, as many regions now use all-in-one touchscreens without a physical keyboard.
9. Designer: Hmm... I'll add that in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, there might be another round this weekend.
10. P8: In that case, shouldn't a virtual keyboard be added to every input field?
11. Designer: Touchscreens already have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input field, probably like that.
13. Designer: I tried it in junior high last time, now there's a clever way to do it, just click the link button on the top right, after the browser pops up, it won't be in full screen anymore... = =
14. P4232: @Designer Yes, that's right.
15. P4232: If there could be an export function, or save and import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set the parameters in the office and import them directly in class.
16. Designer: It will be available.
17. Designer: Is there a network in the classroom?
18. P4232: Generally not, since one time during a city-level open class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 41].

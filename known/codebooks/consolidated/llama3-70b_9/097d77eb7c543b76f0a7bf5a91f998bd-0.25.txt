You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: seeks help, asks questions and seeks human intervention
- The participant actively seeks help from AI, asking questions and providing feedback to clarify their understanding.
- The participant asks questions to clarify AI responses or seeks additional information.

2.
Concepts: clarifies requirements, responds to ai's counter-questions
- The participant clarifies their requirements by providing more detailed information in response to the AI's counter questions.
- The participant responds to AI's counter-questions and clarifies requests.

3.
Concepts: ai experimentation, experiments with ai queries
- Participant experiments with AI to explore its capabilities and limitations.
- The participant experiments with different queries or phrases to see how the AI responds or what results it generates.

4.
Concepts: equation development, uses ai for equation development
- The participant uses the LLM-driven interface to develop equations or mathematical models for agent-based models.
- Participants use AI to develop equations for agent-based models.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: seeks help, asks questions and seeks human intervention
Relationship: The concepts are related in that seeking help and asking questions are both ways of seeking clarification, and seeking human intervention is a possible outcome of these actions.
Criteria: Participants actively seek clarification from AI and/or humans to understand the output.
Phrase: Seeks clarification.

2.
Concepts: clarifies requirements, responds to ai's counter-questions
Relationship: The concepts are related in that clarifying requirements is a response to AI's counter-questions, and responding to AI's counter-questions is a way of clarifying requirements.
Criteria: Participants provide additional information to AI to clarify their requests.
Phrase: Clarifies requirements.

3.
Concepts: ai experimentation, experiments with ai queries
Relationship: The concepts are related in that AI experimentation involves experimenting with different queries to explore AI's capabilities.
Criteria: Participants engage in exploratory activities to understand AI's capabilities and limitations.
Phrase: Experiments with AI.

4.
Concepts: equation development, uses ai for equation development
Relationship: The concepts are related in that using AI for equation development is a specific application of AI in developing equations.
Criteria: Participants utilize AI to create mathematical models for agent-based models.
Phrase: Develops equations with AI.

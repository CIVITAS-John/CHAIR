You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Did you make categories too large?
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Revise and rewrite the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* Conceptual depth
* Learning content
=> Content understanding

* Design factors
* Design input
* Design process
=> Design aspects

* Information exploration
* Technical discourse
=> Information exchange

* User insights
* User interaction
* User involvement
=> User engagement

# Reflection
I merged categories that shared similar themes to streamline the analysis. The categories were not made too large, as I focused on combining smaller categories that were closely related. 
There are more categories that can be merged, such as "community dynamics" and "social interaction" into a broader category like "community engagement." Additionally, "interdisciplinary learning" and "learning tools" could be merged into a category like "learning resources."
The naming of the new categories accurately reflects the combined aspects within each group.

# Final Merging
* Community dynamics
* Social interaction
=> Community engagement

* Interdisciplinary learning
* Learning tools
=> Learning resources

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- User: Yes.

2.
Label: promise to make the feature on a later time
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

3.
Label: providing feature suggestion
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

4.
Label: confirming future feature implementation
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

5.
Label: discussion of further interests

Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

12.
Label: demonstrating responsiveness
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

13.
Label: preventing misunderstandings
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

14.
Label: detailing plans for advanced features

Label: acknowledging the clarification
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay.

16.
Label: responding to tone

Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

18.
Label: suggesting educational content
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Summary of previous conversation: This conversation continues to exhibit community building, knowledge sharing, and the designer's role in shaping the online community. Participants engage in social exchanges, share knowledge, and provide support, using multimedia sharing, questions, and clarifications to facilitate dialogue. The conversation touches on topics like astronomy education, payment information, and community etiquette. The designer's presence is implicit, but their role in shaping the community is evident.
1. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
Preliminary tags: poverty limits my memory; personal experience; community bonding
2. P11: Check it out online, this can't be explained in a few words. @P2 
Preliminary tags: check it out online; this can't be explained in a few words. @p2; redirection; community dialogue
3. P2: Can a motor be added? @Designer 
Preliminary tags: can a motor be added? @ designer; inquiry; technical support
4. P14: I think I should stick to doing math.
5. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
6. Designer: Ours will be simpler, more practical (closer to exams), and cheaper.
7. P11: ðŸ˜‚
8. P11: Hmm, ask the group owner.
9. Designer: After all, it's not specifically for astronomy.
10. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
11. P2: [Image 1-144]
12. P2: As far as I know.
13. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in Physics Lab?
14. Designer: Motor simulation is quite complicated and related to the load.
15. Designer: Calculated...
16. P2: How is it calculated?
17. P11: Okay.
18. P11: Because of that rectifier last time, I naively thought it was a preset model.
19. P11: [Image 1-152]
20. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but it's an atomized model.
21. Designer: Pursuing precision, a phone can't handle the calculations.
22. P1: Server?
23. P11: Hahaha.
24. Designer: Standalone.
25. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
26. Designer: Two types of motors.
27. P1: Are you on the server?
28. P2: There are brush motors.
29. P2: Not brushless motors connected to AC power.
30. P14: Finally talking about something I can understand
31. P2: You don't understand brushless motors
32. P2: It's hard to make it work
33. P4: Making a motor is quite simple if you follow my method @Designer 
34. P14: [Image 1-168]
35. P2: What if it burns out?

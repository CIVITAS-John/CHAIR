You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: request assistance with uploading; express dissatisfaction with current avatar; seek to enhance personal representation
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: clarify platform version; inquire about technical specifications; establish relevance of user experience
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: offer to upload content; engage in dialogue to understand user role; foster community interaction
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: confirm professional identity; establish credibility within the community; contribute to knowledge sharing
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: In analyzing this conversation, I will focus on the interactions between the designers and users to understand how the online community of Physics Lab developed. I will consider aspects of learning sciences, such as how knowledge is co-constructed among participants; human-computer interaction, particularly how users engage with the platform and seek support; and participatory design principles, which emphasize user involvement in the development process. I will look for patterns in the requests and responses to identify emerging themes related to collaboration, support, and the enhancement of the learning experience.

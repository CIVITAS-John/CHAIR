You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Did you make categories too large?
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Revise and rewrite the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging

* Category h
=> Category i

# Reflection
I avoided creating overly broad categories and focused on merging smaller, related categories. By merging categories like "Academic focus" and "Learning components & environment" into "Learning context," the focus remains clear and concise. There are more categories that could be merged, such as "Community engagement and support" with "Community building" into a broader category, but it might make the category too large and lose specificity.

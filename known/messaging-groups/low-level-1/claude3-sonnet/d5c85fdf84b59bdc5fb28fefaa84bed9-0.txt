You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
3. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. P4231: [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
6. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
7. Designer: [Image]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation for social interactions and the emergence of the Physics Lab online community, I will look for tags related to community building, collaboration, requests, responses, and any other relevant social dynamics.

Analysis for all 9 messages:
1. request, respect, specific-feature-request
2. prioritization, planning
3. collaboration, gathering-input
4. gratitude, encouragement
5. information-seeking, community-engagement
6. information-found, gratitude
7. visual-aid
8. update-announcement, feature-change
9. update-announcement, new-feature

Summary: This conversation involves members of the Physics Lab online community discussing feature requests, prioritization of development tasks, gathering input from the community, expressing gratitude and encouragement, seeking and providing information, sharing visual aids, and announcing updates and new features. It demonstrates collaboration, community engagement, and the iterative process of developing the Physics Lab software based on user feedback and needs.

Notes:
- The conversation highlights the importance of community input and collaboration in the development process, with members making requests, designers gathering opinions, and announcements of updates and new features.
- There is a sense of respect and gratitude expressed towards the experts and designers, fostering a positive community dynamic.
- Members actively seek information and engage with the community, indicating a lively and participatory online environment.
- The use of visual aids (images) and specific feature requests suggests a focus on creating engaging and effective educational resources.
- Overall, the conversation reflects the emergence of a collaborative and interactive online community centered around the development and improvement of the Physics Lab software.

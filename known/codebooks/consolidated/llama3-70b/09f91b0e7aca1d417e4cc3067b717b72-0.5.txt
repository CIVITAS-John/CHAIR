You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

5.
Label: positive
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

10.
Label: double slits
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

11.
Label: ensuring participation
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

12.
Label: product gap
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

Label: sharing common practice in circuit diagrams
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

16.
Label: future design plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

17.
Label: contextualizing response
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

18.
Label: explain development process
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

19.
Label: setting minimum system requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

20.
Label: emphasizing convenience
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

21.
Label: demonstrating concept
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa

22.
Label: announcing new releases
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

23.
Label: highlighting potential use case

25.
Label: clarifying system requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

26.
Label: promoting refinement
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

27.
Label: yes
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

28.
Label: explaining xp system incompatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

29.
Label: planning community engagement
Quotes:

30.
Label: platform question
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

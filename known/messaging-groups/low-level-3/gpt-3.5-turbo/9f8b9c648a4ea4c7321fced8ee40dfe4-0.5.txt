You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P4232: I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary tags: user background; teaching experience
2. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available in the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
Preliminary tags: product update announcement
3. Designer: Sorry for the midnight rooster crowing :)
Preliminary tags: informal communication
4. P4233: How can I download it?
Preliminary tags: user inquiry; software download
5. P4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary tags: user inquiry
6. P8: Shared in the group.
Preliminary tags: community sharing
7. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and energized screwdriver this week. If there are any features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group. We will try our best to consider them. Saving experiments to the cloud/local storage, as mentioned before, is also in the plan. Thank you all!

Thoughts: In analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles (learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design), consider the users' background and teaching experiences in relation to their engagement with the product update announcements and user inquiries. Look at how the community sharing and informal communication contribute to the emergence of the online community. Explore how the designer's messages reflect participatory design principles, such as user involvement in feature planning and development.

Tags for each message:
1. user background; teaching experience; educator transition
2. product update announcement; software release
3. informal communication; community engagement
4. user inquiry; software download request
5. user inquiry; politeness
6. community sharing; group engagement
7. software download instructions; community resources
8. participatory design; user feedback; feature planning; cloud storage; community collaboration
9. non-verbal communication; emoji use
10. non-verbal communication; emoji use

Summary: The conversation includes discussions about users' teaching experiences, product updates, user inquiries, community sharing, and participatory design elements. Users inquire about downloading the software, while the designer provides updates on the product and invites user input for future features. The community engages through informal communication and non-verbal cues, contributing to the emergence of the online community.

Notes: The users' diverse teaching backgrounds and experiences may influence their engagement with the Physics Lab platform. The designer's transparent communication and openness to user feedback align with participatory design principles, fostering a collaborative community. The use of emojis and informal language adds a personal touch to the interactions, enhancing community building.

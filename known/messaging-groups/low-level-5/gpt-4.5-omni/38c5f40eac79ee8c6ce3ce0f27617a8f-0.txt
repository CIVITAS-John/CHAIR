You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: user 4230 acknowledges experts; user 4230 makes a detailed request; user 4230 suggests specific features; user 4230 engages in participatory design
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 outlines development priorities; designer 1 responds to user request; designer 1 manages user expectations; designer 1 communicates project timeline
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 plans to gather further opinions; designer 1 emphasizes community input; designer 1 manages project scope; designer 1 ensures user contributions are remembered
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: user 4230 expresses gratitude; user 4230 acknowledges designer efforts; user 4230 shows appreciation; user 4230 maintains positive community interaction
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: user 4231 greets the community; user 4231 uses emoji to express emotion; user 4231 inquires about download options; user 4231 seeks information
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: user 4231 finds information in group files; user 4231 thanks the community; user 4231 acknowledges provided resources; user 4231 engages in self directed learning
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

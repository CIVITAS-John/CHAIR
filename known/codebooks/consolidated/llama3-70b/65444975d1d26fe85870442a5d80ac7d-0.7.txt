You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: recommend newer hardware
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

2.
Label: explain situation
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

3.
Label: encouraging discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

4.
Label: ask how to download software
Quotes:
- User: How to download?

5.
Label: change of topic without answering
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

6.
Label: maintain community engagement
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

7.
Label: facilitate communication
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

8.
Label: explain common practice
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

9.
Label: provide release estimate
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

10.
Label: request specific features
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

21.
Label: ask a question
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Label: seeking feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: So, use both?

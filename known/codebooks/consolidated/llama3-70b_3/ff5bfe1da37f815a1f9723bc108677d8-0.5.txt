You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: uncertainty
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

2.
Label: sharing anecdotal experience

- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

3.
Label: participating in community
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

4.
Label: expressing appreciation for software feature

Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

7.
Label: demonstrate familiarity and user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

8.
Label: proposes dual approach
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

9.
Label: illustrating intersection types
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

10.
Label: consider hardware limitations
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

11.
Label: designer 1 communicates project timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

12.
Label: appreciation for teachers' help
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

13.
Label: designer 1 maintains community etiquette
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

14.
Label: mentions future opportunities
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

15.
Label: emphasizing the need for modern machines
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

16.
Label: expressing positive sentiment about the new features
Quotes:
- User: Oh, this is nice

17.
Label: future design plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

18.
Label: providing insight into educational norms
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

19.
Label: request specific educational features
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

20.
Label: considering system compatibility for older systems
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

21.
Label: encouraging user engagement
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
- Designer: Group sharing.

22.
Label: offer a solution

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer: [Image 14]
8. Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

* Summary
The conversation involves participants in the Physics Lab online community discussing the development and features of the software. P4230 requests dynamic demonstrations of mechanical and optical experiments, while the Designer outlines the development priorities, focusing on electrical and magnetic components first. P4231 inquires about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version and finds the necessary files. The Designer also provides updates on the software's features, including changes to battery simulations and the introduction of a student power supply.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will examine the interaction through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Key guiding questions include: How do community members contribute to the development of educational tools? What roles do feedback and iterative design play in the software's evolution? How do social interactions and shared goals shape the community's emergence? We will identify codes related to these themes and extract relevant quotes to support our analysis.

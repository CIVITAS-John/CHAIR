You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Here is a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research on how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

---
* Summary
The conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab, with designers soliciting feedback from users on specific features, such as circuit diagram design and experimental assessment. Users provide input, and designers respond with explanations and updates on the development process.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do designers engage with users to inform design decisions? What role do users play in shaping the development of Physics Lab? How do designers balance user feedback with their own design goals?

# Co-Designing
## Soliciting Feedback
Definition: Designers actively seek input from users on design decisions.
- "When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group" (Designer-1, line 3)
- "Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?" (Designer-1, line 4)
- "Thank you all for your support. We will do better!" (Designer-1, line 16)

## Responding to Feedback
Definition: Designers acknowledge and respond to user input, incorporating it into the design process.
- "Yes, the common one is still the old style" (User-4234, line 6) → "Uh... left side or right side" (Designer-1, line 7)
- "Left side" (User-4234, line 9) → "Okay." (Designer-1, line 10)
- "But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing" (User-4234, line 12) → "So, use both?" (Designer-1, line 13)

# Community Building
## Expressing Gratitude
Definition: Designers express appreciation for user support and feedback.
- "Thank you all for your support. We will do better!" (Designer-1, line 16)

## Providing Updates
Definition: Designers keep users informed about the development process and timelines.
- "There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend." (Designer-1, lines 18-19)

# Design Decision-Making
## Balancing User Needs
Definition: Designers weigh user feedback against their own design goals and constraints.
- "Make it simpler..." (Designer-1, line 11)
- "This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results" (Designer-1, line 14)

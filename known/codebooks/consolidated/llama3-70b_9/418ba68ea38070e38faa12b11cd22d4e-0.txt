You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: ai generated code usage, use ai-generated code as reference
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both describe the way participants utilize AI-generated code, with the first concept focusing on using it as a starting point and the second concept highlighting the reference aspect.
Criteria: Participants utilize AI-generated code as a reference or starting point in their work.
Phrase: Using AI-generated code as a reference.

2.
Concepts: argues for ai efficiency, highlight time-saving benefits of ai
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both emphasize the benefits of using AI, with the first concept arguing for its efficiency and the second concept highlighting its time-saving aspects.
Criteria: Participants argue that AI increases efficiency and saves time.
Phrase: Advocating for AI's efficiency.

3.
Concepts: appreciate clear explanations from ai, appreciate ai clarification and assistance
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both describe the value participants place on AI's ability to provide clear explanations and assistance.
Criteria: Participants value AI's clear explanations and assistance.
Phrase: Appreciating AI's explanations.

4.
Concepts: identify ai errors and potential bugs, acknowledge ai errors and debug iteratively
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both describe the process of identifying and addressing errors in AI-generated code, with the first concept focusing on identification and the second concept highlighting the iterative debugging process.
Criteria: Participants identify and iteratively debug errors in AI-generated code.
Phrase: Debugging AI-generated code.

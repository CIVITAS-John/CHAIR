You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

7.
Label: seeking suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

8.
Label: contextualizing physics education
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

9.
Label: offering technical support
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

10.
Label: providing resources

- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

12.
Label: theoretically
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

13.
Label: suggesting incremental development
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

14.
Label: question about identity
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

15.
Label: enhancing experimental details
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

16.
Label: confirming update
Quotes:
- User: Updated

17.
Label: explaning technical artifacts
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

18.
Label: community need
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

19.
Label: outlining development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

20.
Label: showing humility
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

21.
Label: considering user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: So, use both?

22.
Label: seeking information
Quotes:
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

31.
Label: explanation of upcoming features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

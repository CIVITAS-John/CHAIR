Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary

* Summary
The conversation involves a user named Designer asking how to upload a high-definition, uncensored version of an avatar. Another user, P4229, inquires if the Designer is referring to the PC version. The Designer then confirms they will upload the image and asks if P4229 is a teacher, to which P4229 responds affirmatively.

We will explore factors such as knowledge sharing, role identification, and technical support. Key guiding questions include: How do participants share and seek information? What roles do individuals assume within the community? How does the design and usability of the platform facilitate or hinder interaction?

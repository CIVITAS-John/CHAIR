You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. User-4232: Thank you.
Preliminary phrases: express gratitude; acknowledge support
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary phrases: offer ongoing support; encourage community engagement
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary phrases: praise software; compare with other software; highlight practicality
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary phrases: consider future compatibility; suggest potential solution
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary phrases: speculate on compatibility; set hardware expectations
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary phrases: announce new version release; provide update details
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

Thoughts: In this conversation, it is essential to understand how the community members interact with each other, how they provide feedback, and how the designers respond to this feedback. Key questions include: How do users express their needs and suggestions? How do designers incorporate user feedback into their development process? What are the dynamics of support and problem-solving within the community? How does the context of use (e.g., classroom settings) influence the design and functionality of the software?

Summary: The conversation reveals a dynamic interaction between users and designers of the Physics Lab software. Users express gratitude and provide positive feedback, highlighting the software's practicality compared to other tools. Designers offer ongoing support and encourage community engagement. Specific suggestions for new features, such as an exit button for touch screens and an export function for experiments, are made by users. Designers respond positively, promising to incorporate these features in future updates. The discussion also touches on technical aspects, such as compatibility with older hardware and the need for on-screen keyboards for touch screens. The context of use, particularly in classroom settings, influences the design considerations, as seen in the discussion about internet access and the need for offline functionality.

Notes: The conversation highlights the participatory design process, where user feedback directly influences software development. The designers' responsiveness and willingness to incorporate suggestions foster a collaborative community environment. The context of use, particularly in educational settings, plays a significant role in shaping the software's features and functionality. Future analysis should explore how these interactions evolve and how they contribute to the community's growth and the software's development.

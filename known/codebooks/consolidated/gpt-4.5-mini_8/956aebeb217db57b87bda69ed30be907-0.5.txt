You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: analyze ai-generated errors, engaging in error reporting and identifying ai error handling issues
Relationship: The concepts are interrelated as analyzing AI-generated errors leads to the recognition of inconsistencies, which in turn prompts users to report these errors and identify handling issues.
Criteria: Users analyze AI-generated outputs to recognize inconsistencies, report errors, and pinpoint issues related to AI's error handling.
Phrase: Analyzing and reporting AI errors.

2. 
Concepts: recognize ai's time-saving potential, advocate for ai's time-saving efficiency
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as recognizing AI's time-saving potential informs users' advocacy for its efficiency in completing tasks more quickly than traditional methods.
Criteria: Users perceive AI as a time-saving tool and advocate for its efficiency in enhancing problem-solving and reducing task completion time.
Phrase: Advocating for AI's efficiency.

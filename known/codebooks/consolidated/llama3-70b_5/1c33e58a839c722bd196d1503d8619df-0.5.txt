You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: direct communication
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

8.
Label: assure timely response to user feedback

- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

9.
Label: share positive user feedback
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

10.
Label: reciprocate greeting
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

11.
Label: addressed component functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

12.
Label: highlight innovative design
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

13.
Label: inquire about user's background
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

14.
Label: confirm upcoming update
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

15.
Label: designer 1 manages expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

16.
Label: emphasize practical utility
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

17.
Label: acknowledged interaction limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

18.
Label: foster community engagement
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group
- Designer: Group sharing.
- Designer: Okay.

19.
Label: validated designer's explanation
Quotes:
- User: Indeed

20.
Label: express interest in community features
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

21.
Label: express positive sentiment
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]
- User: Oh, this is nice

22.
Label: validate designer's direction
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

23.
Label: referenced technical constraints
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

24.
Label: express concern
Quotes:
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?

25.
Label: facilitate access to software
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

26.
Label: answer a concern
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

27.
Label: engage with community for support
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
- User: How to download?

28.
Label: engaged with community
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
- User: How do you use the PC version?

29.
Label: further suggestion
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

30.
Label: user 4232 considers educational context
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

31.
Label: explained future feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

32.
Label: share personal experience to illustrate a workaround
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (11 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
11. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P16: ï¼‹1
Preliminary tags: agreement with previous comment; social interaction; community engagement
2. P10: May I ask what does "+1" mean?
Preliminary tags: inquiry about online communication; seeking clarification; community norms
3. P11: It means "me too".
Preliminary tags: explanation of online communication; community norms; knowledge sharing
4. P13: +1 means the same opinion.
Preliminary tags: agreement with previous comment; social interaction; community norms
5. P13: emmmm
Preliminary tags: hesitation in response; social interaction; group dynamics
6. P13: You can search on Baidu.
Preliminary tags: suggestion for information seeking; community norms; knowledge sharing
7. P10: Oh, I see. Thank you.
8. P2: +1
9. P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for.
10. P17: I'm just looking.
11. P4: No problem.

Thoughts: Understanding the emergence of Physics Lab's online community involves looking at how members engage with each other, establish norms, and share knowledge. Analyzing the dynamics of social interactions, information seeking behaviors, and agreement/disagreement expressions can provide insights into the community's development.
Tags for each message (11 in total):
1. agreement with previous comment; social interaction; community engagement
2. inquiry about online communication; seeking clarification; community norms
3. explanation of online communication; community norms; knowledge sharing
4. agreement with previous comment; social interaction; community norms
5. hesitation in response; social interaction; group dynamics
6. suggestion for information seeking; community norms; knowledge sharing
7. acknowledgment of understanding
8. agreement with previous comment
9. reference to cost in experiments
10. browsing behavior
11. acknowledgment of no issues
Summary: The conversation captures various aspects of the online community's emergence, including agreement expressions, clarification of online communication norms, knowledge sharing, cost considerations in experiments, and browsing behaviors. The interaction reflects the establishment of social norms and information sharing practices within the community.
Notes: The community members seem to be supportive of each other's comments and actively engage in explaining and clarifying online communication norms. The mention of costs in experiments and the suggestion for information seeking indicate a practical and collaborative approach within the community. The dynamics of social interactions and the exchange of knowledge play a significant role in shaping the emergent online community of Physics Lab.

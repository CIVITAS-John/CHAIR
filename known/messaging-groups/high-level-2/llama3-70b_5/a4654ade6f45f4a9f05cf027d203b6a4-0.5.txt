Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1

1. P4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. P4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

* Summary
The conversation starts with P4230 requesting a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and vibrations, and the Designer responds by prioritizing the completion of the electrical section. P4230 thanks the Designer, and then P4231 asks about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab. The Designer shares an image, and then announces changes to the ideal components in the next update.

* Plan
The plan is to analyze this conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do participants negotiate and prioritize tasks? How do designers respond to user requests? What role do images play in communication? How do participants use emojis and images to convey tone and meaning?

# Community Building
## Request for Features
Definition: Participants request new features or functionalities.
- "Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations..."
- "Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers..."

## Expression of Gratitude
Definition: Participants express thanks or appreciation.
- "Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work."

# Communication Strategies
## Use of Emojis
Definition: Participants use emojis to convey tone or emotion.
- "[Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?"

## Use of Images
Definition: Participants share images to convey information or illustrate a point.
- "[Image 2-14]"

# Design and Development
## Prioritization of Tasks
Definition: Participants discuss or negotiate the order of tasks or features.
- "We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts."
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything."

## Announcement of Changes
Definition: The Designer announces changes or updates to the Physics Lab platform.
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate)."
- "The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component."

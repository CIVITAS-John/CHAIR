You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

* Summary
The conversation revolves around the design and development of a function for simulated experiment assessment in the context of electricity. The designer seeks input from the community on various aspects, such as the type of intersection used in circuit diagrams and the auto-layout algorithm's stability. The designer also shares plans for upcoming updates and releases.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will consider the learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design perspectives. We will focus on how the designers engage with the community, how they incorporate user feedback, and how they balance complexity and usability in their designs. We will also examine how the designers communicate updates and progress to the community.

# Collaborative Design
## Seeking User Input
Definition: Designers actively soliciting feedback and suggestions from users.
- "When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group" (Designer-1)
- "Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?" (Designer-1)
- "Uh... left side or right side" (Designer-1)

## Incorporating User Feedback
Definition: Designers modifying their designs based on user feedback.
- "Left side" (User-4234)
- "So, use both?" (Designer-1)
- "This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results" (Designer-1)

# Communication and Transparency
## Sharing Progress and Updates
Definition: Designers informing users about the development process and upcoming releases.
- "There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend." (Designer-1)
- "The update is quite large..." (Designer-1)
- "Thank you all for your support. We will do better!" (Designer-1)

## Responding to User Queries

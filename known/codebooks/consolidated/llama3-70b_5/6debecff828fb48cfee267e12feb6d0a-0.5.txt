You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: adapting to time constraints
Quotes:
- E04: It'd be that I just take this and see what this does. This should just be a single node so it'll kind of overwrite what I already did. (interviewer's observation) E04 uses the AI-generated code completely when realizing time constraints.

2.
Label: discusses potential ai roles
Quotes:
- E01: What if you were just sitting in a peer programming and sitting next to a, uh, a bright person who was helping you, what would you want them to do? So you might start writing a line of code and they would stop and go, why are you, why are you typing? (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how AI could potentially serve as a pair programmer that questions the learners' motives.

3.
Label: not seeking explanations
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E04 manually tries to fix the errors in the AI-generated code and did not choose "explain it".

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
Definitions for each code:

1.
Criteria: The participant uses or considers using the LLM-driven interface to save time or overcome time constraints, often by relying on AI-generated code.
Label: Adapting to time constraints

2.
Criteria: The participant discusses or imagines potential roles or scenarios where the LLM-driven interface could assist or collaborate with them, such as pairing or peer programming.
Label: Envisioning AI collaboration roles

3.
Criteria: The participant does not request or seek explanations for the AI-generated code, instead opting to manually fix errors or understand the code on their own.
Label: Not seeking explanations

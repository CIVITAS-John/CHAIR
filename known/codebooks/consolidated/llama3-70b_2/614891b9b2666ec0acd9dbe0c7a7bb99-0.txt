You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: values ai's debugging, expresses a positive view of ai's debugging, appreciates ai's debugging
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected, as valuing and appreciating AI's debugging ability imply a positive view of it.
Criteria: Participants who value, express a positive view, and appreciate AI's debugging ability.
Phrase: Appreciate AI's debugging.

2.
Concepts: sees value in iterative debugging, describes iterative debugging benefits
Relationship: The concepts are causally related, as seeing value in iterative debugging leads to describing its benefits.
Criteria: Participants who see value in and describe benefits of iterative debugging with AI.
Phrase: Describe iterative debugging benefits.

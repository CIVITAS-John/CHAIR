You are an expert in thematic analysis. Each code is merged from multiple ones.
Write labels and consolidate criteria to apply across quotes. Both should be clear and generalizable, without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Group each code into a category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").

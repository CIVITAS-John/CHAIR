You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (32 in total):
1. {interpretation of message 1}; {another}; ...
...
32. {interpretation of message 32}; {another}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary codes: politeness strategy; social norm; consideration for others
2. Designer-2: Group sharing.
Preliminary codes: feature suggestion; collaboration tool; design consideration; user engagement
3. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
Preliminary codes: providing instructions; technical support; resource sharing
4. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
Preliminary codes: development roadmap; feature update; community engagement; feedback solicitation
5. User-4234: [Emoji 2-56]
Preliminary codes: emoji
6. User-4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]
Preliminary codes: emotional expression; playfulness; social bonding; community building
7. User-4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer-1: Hello :)
9. User-4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer-1: [Image 2-61] Updates in preparation
11. Designer-1: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
12. Designer-1: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
13. User-4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer-1: What problems did you encounter during use?
15. Designer-1: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
16. User-4235: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school
17. User-4235: Need the user manual for this software
18. Designer-1: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
19. User-4232: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
20. Designer-1: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer-1: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
22. User-4235: Can you also include mechanics experiments?
23. Designer-1: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer-1: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
25. User-4232: Oh, this is nice
26. Designer-1: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
27. User-4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer-1: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application
29. User-4234: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji 2-80]
30. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
31. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer-1: Hmm.

Thoughts: As I begin analyzing the conversation, I'm considering the research question of how the Physics Lab's online community emerged. I'll be looking for codes that relate to community building, user engagement, and design considerations. I'll also explore how the designers and users interact, and what features and updates are being discussed.

Codes for each message:

1. politeness strategy; social norm; consideration for others
2. feature suggestion; collaboration tool; design consideration; user engagement
3. providing instructions; technical support; resource sharing
4. development roadmap; feature update; community engagement; feedback solicitation
5. emotional expression; playfulness
6. emotional expression; playfulness; social bonding; community building
7. social greeting
8. social response; acknowledgement
9. inquiry about updates
10. visual communication; update notification
11. development complexity; timeline
12. feature list; development roadmap
13. inquiry about user manual
14. troubleshooting; user experience
15. design philosophy; user-centered design
16. contextual information; educational setting
17. request for user manual
18. private communication; personalized support
19. feature request; usability suggestion
20. research and development; innovative feature
21. manual editing; future development
22. feature request; content expansion
23. research and development; innovative feature
24. development roadmap; prioritization
25. positive feedback
26. development timeline
27. positive feedback; user experience
28. innovative feature; problem-solving
29. positive feedback; emotional expression
30. innovative feature; interactive simulation
31. design philosophy; incremental development
32. acknowledgement; contemplation

Summary: The conversation begins with a user greeting and a designer suggesting a collaboration tool. The designers provide updates on the development roadmap, including new features and a timeline. Users ask questions, provide feedback, and request features, such as a user manual and mechanics experiments. The designers respond with explanations, troubleshooting, and personalized support. The conversation is characterized by a sense of community, with users and designers engaging in a collaborative and supportive dialogue.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the designers are actively engaging with users, providing updates, and soliciting feedback. The users are enthusiastic and provide constructive suggestions. The conversation is lighthearted, with emojis and playful interactions. I'll continue to explore how this community emerges and evolves in the next rounds of coding.

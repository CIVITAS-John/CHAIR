You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

~~~
1.
Label: values practical solutions
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 chooses to fix the problem rather than showing the explanation.

2.
Label: critical evaluation of ai output
Quotes:
- E01: So set up, move the turtle to go. Increase the size of the turtle by two units. Oh, dear. It's, it's making the turtle bigger. Oh, that's kind of, that's kind of messed it up a little bit then. (interviewer's observation) E01 reads the code and comments, summarizing the code, and thinks about how the AI was understanding the request.
- E04: "How about without the R extension" (interviewer's observation) E04 evaluates the AI response and decides that he does not need to use the R extension.
- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

3.
Label: recognizing value in ai generated code structure
Quotes:
- E01: This is what conversations with ChatGPT typically look like. I had to go through about eight separate times to get all the errors out of it.  But, but look at how it structured the code. Look at the things that did look what you could learn from this. This is valuable. (interviewer's observation) Users may benefit from the iterative debugging process during working with AI, even though AI might give wrong answers.

4.
Label: tests ai's search capabilities
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a neural network" - I want to see if it actually pulls up the model. (interviewer's observation) E04 experiments with the AI to see what phrases could give a correct search result.

5.
Label: inputting task parameters
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 dictated each of the parameter fields.

6.
Label: communicates specific needs
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a simple feed-forward neural network in NetLogo with one hidden layer."

7.
Label: acknowledges the time saving aspect of ai generated solutions
Quotes:
- E01: The problem I posted was about 100 pages of NetLogo and then 100 pages, 100 lines of NetLogo. And it was a real problem that I had looked at. I would love to help this person, but this is going to take me minimum of two hours to figure out what are they trying to do? (interviewer's observation) Although AI made mistake, E01 still believes in the value in having an AI-generated solution (compared with no solution or no help).

8.
Label: suggesting human like ai communication
Quotes:
- E01: I speak to (ChatGPT) like a person. I could just walk in the room and go write me code that does X, but I don't, I start with good morning. And it comes back, but it comes back with good morning. How can I assist you today? It's pretty good at figuring out natural language. So in some sense that you might just be better off, just pretend it's not a computer. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how he interacts with ChatGPT like a person.

9.
Label: human-ai interaction
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.
- E01: I speak to (ChatGPT) like a person. I could just walk in the room and go write me code that does X, but I don't, I start with good morning. And it comes back, but it comes back with good morning. How can I assist you today? It's pretty good at figuring out natural language. So in some sense that you might just be better off, just pretend it's not a computer. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how he interacts with ChatGPT like a person.
- E01: In terms of learning experiences, like ramping up to using an assistant wrapping up to using ChatGPT might have some sort of evaluates. How well can you write instructions for another person? Some people just don't know how to conceptualize a problem. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how "writing instructions" is a capability that is missing on many people, and that is key to work with AI.
- E04: So if I can talk to it in NetLogo, does that mean I could give it in the logo command and then it would like turn that into code on the backend or? (interviewer's observation) Initial confusion over what the system could do.

10.
Label: values error detection
Quotes:
- E01: I don't know how much it understands about all of the efficiencies of NetLogo... But it (could) catch obvious errors that are not obvious to me. Even if it's relatively dumb, it's an outside observer, which is great. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could serve as an outside observer that points out errors human did not realize.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (32 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

2.
Label: promoting ideal components
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

3.
Label: highlighting priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

4.
Label: mentions theoretical compatibility requirements for the software
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

5.

Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

6.
Label: demonstrating interest in development
Quotes:
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]

7.

- Designer: Make it simpler...

8.
Label: highlights usability concerns

- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

9.
Label: identifies regional user needs
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

13.
Label: designing intuitive interface
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

14.

19.
Label: focusing on electrical and magnetism topics first
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

20.
Label: explaining current limitations of software
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

21.
Label: setting a timeline goal for figuring out electromagnetism
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

22.
Label: addressing educational needs
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

23.
Label: addressing bug fixes
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

25.
Label: contextualizes physics lab's focus
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

26.
Label: concurring on design ideas
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

27.
Label: promising timely response
Quotes:

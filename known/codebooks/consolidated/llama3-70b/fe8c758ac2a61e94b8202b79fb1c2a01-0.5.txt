You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not write repetitive ones.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: give rationale to development decision
Quotes:
- This belongs to the kind of function that ensures long-term stability after it's done... It's actually simpler to add various components.
- But it's still better to make the automatically generated one as good as possible

2.
Label: followup question
Quotes:
- Have you encountered any problems during your use?
- Um... left or right?
- Can it run on Win7?

3.
Label: explain intention of question
Quotes:
- Mainly for schools to build information technology schools
- We are working on this.

4.
Label: feature request
Quotes:
- This is great, hoping it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams. Also, it would be great to have a function to hide the background grid with one click, making it easier for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no convenient software for drawing circuit diagrams for circuit-related questions.
- It is suggested to add an exit button function for the PC version, as many regions now use all-in-one touch screen computers without physical keyboards.
- You can also include mechanics experiments

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (7 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: identifies bugs, suspects bug in ai
Relationship: The two concepts are related in that identifying bugs and suspecting their presence are part of the same error detection process.
Criteria: Interviewees detect and suspect errors in AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Suspects and identifies bugs.

2.
Concepts: error reporting, detects errors
Relationship: Error reporting and detection are two aspects of the same process, where errors are identified and reported through LLM-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Interviewees report and detect errors through LLM-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Reports and detects errors.

3.
Concepts: error identification and debugging, debugging and troubleshooting
Relationship: Error identification, debugging, and troubleshooting are interconnected processes that involve finding and fixing errors with the help of LLM-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Interviewees identify and fix errors with the help of LLM-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Identifies and debugs errors.

4.
Concepts: reads error messages, prepares for next steps
Relationship: Reading error messages is a necessary step before preparing for next steps in the error resolution process.
Criteria: Interviewees read error messages to prepare for next steps.
Phrase: Reads and prepares.

5.
Concepts: error clarification, chatlogo ability (positive): debug
Relationship: Error clarification is a key aspect of the AI's ability to help users debug code, making it easier to understand and resolve errors.
Criteria: AI clarifies error codes to help users understand and debug.
Phrase: Clarifies error codes.

6.
Concepts: error handling, clarification and troubleshooting
Relationship: Error handling, clarification, and troubleshooting are related aspects of the AI's ability to effectively manage errors.
Criteria: AI handles errors by clarifying and troubleshooting.
Phrase: Handles errors effectively.

7.
Concepts: resolves errors with ai, notes ai's error resolution
Relationship: Resolving errors with AI assistance and noting the AI's ability to resolve errors are two sides of the same coin, highlighting the collaborative and autonomous aspects of error resolution.

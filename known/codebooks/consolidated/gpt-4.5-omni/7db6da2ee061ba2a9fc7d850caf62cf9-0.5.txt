You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

1. usability feedback, user feedback.
- Users' comments on the software's ease of use and practicality.
- Contributions from users that provide suggestions, highlight issues, or express needs regarding the software.

2. soliciting feedback, feedback incorporation.
- Instances where designers or developers ask for user suggestions and feedback.
- Instances where user input or feedback influences design decisions and software development.

3. peer support, peer assistance and information sharing.
- Instances where users provide assistance or encouragement to each other.
- Community members helping each other with information and resources.

Categories:
* User Interaction
* Feedback Processes
* Community Support

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. usability feedback, user feedback.
Relationship: Both concepts deal with feedback from users, but usability feedback is a subset of user feedback that specifically addresses ease of use and practicality.
Criteria: Comments and contributions from users that provide suggestions, highlight issues, or express needs, especially focusing on the software's ease of use and practicality.
Label: User Feedback
Category: User Interaction

2. soliciting feedback, feedback incorporation.
Relationship: Soliciting feedback is the act of asking for user input, while feedback incorporation is the process of integrating that input into design and development.
Criteria: Instances where designers or developers ask for user suggestions and feedback, and where user input influences design decisions and software development.
Label: Feedback Processes
Category: Feedback Processes

3. peer support, peer assistance and information sharing.
Relationship: Both concepts involve community members helping each other, whether through providing assistance, encouragement, or sharing information and resources.
Criteria: Instances where users provide assistance, encouragement, or share information and resources with each other.
Label: Peer Support
Category: Community Support

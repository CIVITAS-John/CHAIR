You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

5.
Label: detail educational benefits
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

6.
Label: providing information about system compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.
- User: Win7 should be fine.

7.
Label: providing individualized support
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

Label: highlight ideal use
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

9.
Label: compliment
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: This idea is really good

10.

- User: Indeed

18.
Label: prioritizing development areas
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

19.
Label: emphasizing the focus on quality
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

20.
Label: confirms the prevalence of the old style intersection in circuit diagrams as per user input
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Phrases for each message (5 in total):
1. {interpretation of message 1}; ...

5. {interpretation of message 5}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on capturing the essence of each message, considering the research question and the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I'll explore how the designers and users interact, and how this interaction might be shaping the online community.

Phrases for each message:
1. Designer-2 shares an image, possibly an avatar or a design concept; 
2. Designer-1 seeks help with uploading a high-definition avatar, citing censorship concerns; 
3. User-4229 inquires about a PC version, possibly referring to the platform or a specific feature; 
4. Designer-1 responds to User-4229, offering to upload a file and asking about their profession; 
5. User-4229 identifies as a teacher.

Summary: The conversation starts with an image shared by Designer-2, followed by Designer-1 seeking help with uploading an avatar. User-4229 joins the conversation, asking about a PC version, and Designer-1 responds, asking about User-4229's profession. The conversation is informal, with designers and users interacting and sharing information.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, seeking feedback, and offering assistance. The conversation is centered around technical aspects, such as uploading files and platform compatibility. The fact that User-4229 is a teacher might be significant, as it could indicate that the online community is attracting educators, which might influence the community's direction.

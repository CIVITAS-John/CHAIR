You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: debug ai-generated code, review ai-generated code for errors
Relationship: The two concepts are interconnected as reviewing AI-generated code for errors is a necessary step before debugging.
Criteria: Participants review and debug AI-generated code to ensure its accuracy and functionality.
Phrase: Identify and correct errors in AI-generated code.

2.
Concepts: suggests improvement, propose modifications to ai-generated code
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related as suggesting improvements implies proposing modifications to the AI-generated code.
Criteria: Participants propose modifications to AI-generated code to improve its accuracy or functionality.
Phrase: Suggest improvements to AI-generated code.

3.
Concepts: emphasize ai's time saving potential, emphasizes productivity increase
Relationship: The two concepts are equivalent, as emphasizing AI's time-saving potential is equivalent to emphasizing its potential to increase productivity.
Criteria: Participants highlight the potential of AI to increase productivity and efficiency.
Phrase: Highlight AI's productivity benefits.

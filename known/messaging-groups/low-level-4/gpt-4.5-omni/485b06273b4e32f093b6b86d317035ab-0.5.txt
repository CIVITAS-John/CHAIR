You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: explaining future feature; detailing functionality; addressing educational needs
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: expressing approval; giving positive feedback; supporting development
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: announcing future consultation; involving community in development; promoting participatory design
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Preliminary phrases: seeking specific feedback; consulting users; involving community in development
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: confirming user feedback; ensuring understanding; addressing educational needs
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirming feedback; validating common usage; participating in community interaction
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation highlights the participatory design process within the Physics Lab online community. Designer-1 introduces a new feature for simulated experiment assessment and seeks feedback from users, particularly focusing on the types of circuit diagrams used in textbooks. User-4232 and User-4234 provide feedback and suggestions, which Designer-1 acknowledges and incorporates into the design process. The interaction demonstrates a collaborative effort to address educational needs and improve usability. Designer-1 also provides updates on the development progress and expresses gratitude for the community's support.

Notes: The conversation illustrates the importance of user feedback in the design process and how designers actively seek and incorporate this feedback. It also highlights the role of community interaction in shaping the final product and ensuring it meets educational needs. The participatory design approach is evident, with designers consulting users and making adjustments based on their input. This process not only improves the product but also fosters a sense of community and shared ownership among users.

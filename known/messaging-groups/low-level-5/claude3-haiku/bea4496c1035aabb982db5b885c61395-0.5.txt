Summary of previous conversation: The conversation reveals the emergence of an online community around the development of an educational physics software called "Physics Lab". The designers are actively engaging with the user community, soliciting feedback, and communicating their plans for new features and updates. The discussion covers topics such as supporting different platforms, adding new components and functionalities, and the potential for bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams. The users are expressing their needs, providing suggestions, and generally showing interest and enthusiasm for the software. The designers are responsive to user feedback and are working towards incorporating it into the development process. The conversation suggests a collaborative and iterative approach to the software's design and development, with the goal of creating a user-friendly and comprehensive tool for physics education.
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary phrases: reiterating the bidirectional conversion concept
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary phrases: providing a suggestion to focus on categorization and refinement rather than completeness
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary phrases: acknowledging the suggestion
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

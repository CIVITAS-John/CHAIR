Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

* Summary
This conversation involves multiple members of an online group discussing administrative roles and membership. One member asks if an admin can join, while another questions whether all members are top students. Some members respond with "+1", which is clarified to mean "me too" or agreement with the previous statement about not being a top student.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Community formation and roles: Examine how members negotiate administrative roles and membership criteria, which could shed light on the emergence of the online community.

2. Communication norms and practices: Explore the use of "+1" as a form of communication and how members negotiate its meaning, which could reveal insights into the group's interaction patterns and norms.

3. Participatory design and user experience: Investigate how the online platform or messaging system shapes the way members interact and communicate, and how this might influence the community's emergence and evolution.

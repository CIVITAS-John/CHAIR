1. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
2. P4232: This is a really good idea
3. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

5. Designer: [Image]This one.
6. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.
7. Designer: Um... left or right?
8. Designer: We are working on this.
9. P4234: Left side.
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Keep it simple...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side without crossing.
13. Designer: So, should we use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, and may produce some weird results.
15. Designer: [Image]
16. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be updates this week? [Emoji]
18. Designer: There will be updates. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version over the weekend.

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: shared workaround; referenced personal experience; provided practical advice; acknowledged limitation
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: confirmed understanding; engaged in dialogue; provided affirmation; maintained communication
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: suggested new feature; highlighted convenience; described specific use case; provided constructive feedback
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: confirmed feature addition; reassured user; demonstrated responsiveness; acknowledged user need
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquired about technical condition; considered implementation context; engaged in problem solving; demonstrated thoroughness
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: described technical limitation; provided context; explained institutional policy; used humor to lighten tone
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

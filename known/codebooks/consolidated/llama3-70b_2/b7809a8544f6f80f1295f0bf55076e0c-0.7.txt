You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (24 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: sets boundaries
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

2.
Label: seeking assistance with avatar customization
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

3.
Label: recognizing limitation in previous statement
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

4.
Label: considering implementation constraints
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

5.
Label: seeking clarification on availability
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

6.
Label: identity inquiry
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

7.
Label: inquires about downloading pc/interactive whiteboard version of physics lab
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

8.
Label: planning for simulation details
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

9.
Label: showing interest in functionality
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

10.
Label: confirms locating desired resources
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

11.
Label: asking for download options
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

12.
Label: asking for instructions
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

13.
Label: provide background information
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

14.
Label: mentions ongoing research on physical circuit diagram conversion
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

15.
Label: confirm feature update
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

16.
Label: outlining a plan for simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

17.
Label: prepares users for changes
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

18.
Label: showing independence
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

19.
Label: sharing technical context
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

20.
Label: providing development update
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation
- Designer: We are working on this part

21.
Label: setting realistic timelines
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

22.
Label: providing context for software use
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

23.
Label: development goals
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

24.
Label: engaging with the community for assistance
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: paying homage to experts; making a feature request; suggesting new content ideas
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: prioritizing development tasks; setting expectations; managing user requests
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: gathering user opinions; seeking input; planning for future development
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: expressing gratitude; acknowledging designer's effort; showing appreciation
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: expressing curiosity; asking for resource location; seeking access to physics lab versions
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: finding resources; expressing gratitude; utilizing community provided information
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

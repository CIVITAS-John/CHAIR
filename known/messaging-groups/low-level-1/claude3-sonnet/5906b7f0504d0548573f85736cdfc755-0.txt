Thoughts: To analyze this conversation for open coding, I will go through each message and identify low-level tags related to social interactions and the emergence of the online community. I will focus on actions, behaviors, and dynamics between participants.

Messages:
1. P14: ...Let me get admitted first. | Expressing intention, anticipation
2. P2: I'm still in the second year of junior high school. | Sharing personal information, age/education level
3. P11: Keep it up. | Encouragement, support
4. P13: I'm in the first year of high school. | Sharing personal information, age/education level  
5. P2: What about MOSFETs? | Asking a question, seeking information
6. P2: @Designer | Mentioning/tagging another user
7. P17: [Image] | Sharing visual information, image
8. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes? | Asking a question, seeking clarification

Summary: The conversation involves participants sharing personal information about their age and education level. There are expressions of intention, encouragement, and support. Questions are asked to seek information and clarification. An image is shared, and another user is mentioned/tagged.

Notes: The conversation seems to involve a mix of on-topic discussions about physics concepts and simulations, as well as off-topic personal exchanges and sharing. The participants appear to be students or interested in physics/science. There are signs of a developing community, with participants engaging with each other, sharing information, and providing support.

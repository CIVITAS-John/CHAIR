You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: share personal experience to illustrate a workaround; provide practical advice for users; enhance community knowledge sharing
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: express agreement with designerâ€™s insights; strengthen collaborative dialogue; affirm shared understanding among community members
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: propose additional features to enhance usability; emphasize practical applications in educational settings; advocate for user driven design
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: assure user of forthcoming feature; reinforce commitment to user needs; promote anticipation for future updates
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquire about classroom technology; assess user environment for software application; facilitate understanding of user context
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: share experience of network limitations; highlight potential barriers to software use; underscore importance of safety in educational settings
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Thoughts: In analyzing this conversation, I aim to identify how the online community around Physics Lab is forming through interactions between designers and users. I will explore the dynamics of knowledge sharing, feature requests, and the implications of user experiences on design. By approaching this from learning sciences, I will consider how these exchanges contribute to educational practices. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I will assess the relevance of user feedback in shaping the software's functionality. Lastly, I will examine participatory design principles to understand how community involvement influences the development process.

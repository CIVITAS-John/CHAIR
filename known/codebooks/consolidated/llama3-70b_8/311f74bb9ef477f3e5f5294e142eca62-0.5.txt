You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: highlighting aiâ€™s demand for specificity
Quotes:
- E01: "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square, but the square should go larger each time it goes around." (interviewer's observation) Seeing AI's counter question, E01 makes his request more detailed.

2.
Label: proposes trying chat gpt
Quotes:
- E01: "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square, but the square should go larger each time it goes around in NetLogo." (interviewer's observation) Interviewer proposes to try ChatGPT with the same prompt.

3.
Label: valuing an external observer perspective
Quotes:
- E01: I don't know how much it understands about all of the efficiencies of NetLogo... But it (could) catch obvious errors that are not obvious to me. Even if it's relatively dumb, it's an outside observer, which is great. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could serve as an outside observer that points out errors human did not realize.

4.
Label: suggesting the current design may not be optimized for expert users
Quotes:
- E04: Part of the issue that I'm having now is just kind of like the learning curve, just trying to figure out how everything works. (interviewer's observation) E04 mentions a learning curve, likely because our current design is not fine-tuned for experts.

5.
Label: imagining ai questioning user actions
Quotes:
- E01: What if you were just sitting in a peer programming and sitting next to a, uh, a bright person who was helping you, what would you want them to do? So you might start writing a line of code and they would stop and go, why are you, why are you typing? (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how AI could potentially serve as a pair programmer that questions the learners' motives.

6.
Label: e04 recognizes ai's adherence to coding standards
Quotes:
- E04: It's basically following best practices. It is not trying to ruthlessly create a model. (interviewer's observation) Not "ruthlessly create a model".

7.
Label: identifies potential bug
Quotes:
- E04: maybe you saw something that I didn't, but from my perspective, it seemed as though the code was set up appropriately, but it was marking the syntax as wrong. So maybe I was missing something, but I didn't see anything missing. So that was kind of frustrating. (interviewer's observation) Shows error messages even when it seems to be correct (that's a bug identified)

8.
Label: wiki type of assistance on the side
Quotes:
- E04: Because I'll like forget the syntax sometimes and I usually use the netlogo dictionary and just have it like open to the side. (interviewer's observation) E04 still forgets about the syntax and ChatGPT can help.

9.
Label: suggesting a potential area for education and training
Quotes:
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time. (interviewer's observation) AI could potentially save time for learning new extensions (compared with core concepts) of NetLogo.

10.
Label: initial request for code generation
Quotes:
- E01: So let's say "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square." (interviewer's observation) E01's first task.

11.
Label: seeking specific syntax information
Quotes:
- E04: "how to define breeds in netlogo" (interviewer's observation) E04 tries to find certain syntax structures from the AI-generated code and ask for it when it is not there.

12.
Label: recognizing efficiency gains from ai assistance
Quotes:
- E04: And it could take a lot of time to like search the documentation and go online and try and figure out all those answers and just to have it like right there. So you can kind of stay within the task is really nice. (interviewer's observation) The capability to search for documentation and read it inside the workspace: esp. beneficial for novices.

13.
Label: likes automatic code placement
Quotes:
- E04: I really liked how, like the code that it generates, if you could just kind of place that into the model automatically.  (interviewer's observation) The capability to put into the model automatically.

14.
Label: comparing novices' and experts' expectations
Quotes:
- E01: And, and they don't, this is an unfamiliar task to them apparently. So they want to ask one question and get the right answer the first time. And I, I don't have that expectation. I'll ask the right question and it'll get me 80% of the way there. (interviewer's observation) Novices might have a too high expectation for ChatGPT (but it cannot achieve that).

15.
Label: values clear problem descriptions
Quotes:
- E01: if you approach the user group politely, graciously, and instead of dropping your entire code on it, you go, I narrowed it down to this. I read this documentation. I tried these eight things with this answer and I'm perplexed. If somebody goes, they paste their problem and it's clearly their homework and they want someone else to do it for them. No, I'm not going to help with that. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on proper practices to seek online help: do your own work and clearly describe what you need/tried.

16.
Label: recognizing need for debugging education
Quotes:
- E01: I'm not sure that any beginner wouldn't necessarily know that unless they'd ever practiced. And so some of the users of NetLogo have never programmed anything. So, (they might lack) the whole concept of debugging or maybe starting with a design outline. They start typing and then they get frustrated because they don't know how to debug code. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how novices might get stuck during the human-AI collaboration process.

17.
Label: e04 expects ai to find specific net logo models
Quotes:
- E04: I know that Perceptron model exists in the NetLogo model library. So it's interesting to me that it didn't pull that up, but it could be that I used like the wrong verbiage, but it doesn't understand what I'm trying to do. (interviewer's observation) E04 expects ChatLogo to find "Perceptron" model from the library but it does not. He evaluates the search results of the AI.

18.
Label: imagines ai as a learning path builder
Quotes:
- E01: Can it design a generic learning management path? Because a lot of people can develop systems, but they're not good teachers. (interviewer's observation) Hypothetically: maybe AI could be used for building learning pathways.

19.
Label: demonstrating a pragmatic mindset in deciding when to abandon the ai's suggestions
Quotes:
- E04: So that's interesting anyways, I'm going back to Perceptron. (interviewer's observation) E04 gives up immediately after the AI asks the same question again.

20.
Label: demonstrating thorough code review
Quotes:
- E01: "Also a good idea because we did not ask it to do that." (interviewer's observation) E01 reads and evaluates the ChatGPT code. Asks Interviewer to scroll slowly so he could read in detail.

21.
Label: critiques limited options
Quotes:
- E04: Like in this type of, like, like I was saying with this window, for example, where it's giving you the options and basically there was that one time where the only option was for it to explain itself.  Which makes sense, but it'd be nice if I could just kind of like forego that and just keep doing, you know, But you know, for someone that's probably not as useful for someone who's like still learning, but like, I guess for someone who's more experienced, it's nice to be able to just like skip over things that you already know. (interviewer's observation) Options too limited; tension between a novice-oriented/expert-oriented design.

22.
Label: tests ai with easy drawing tasks
Quotes:
- E04: "Draw a smiley face" / "Drawing on the canvas" (interviewer's observation) E04 switches to a simpler task.

23.
Label: suggests ai's role in communication
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.

24.
Label: novices may lack debugging skills
Quotes:
- E01: I'm not sure that any beginner wouldn't necessarily know that unless they'd ever practiced. And so some of the users of NetLogo have never programmed anything.

1. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
3. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. P4231: [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
6. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
7. Designer: [Image]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

Summary: The conversation involves a user (P4230) requesting features for simulating mechanical waves, vibrations, and optical experiments in the Physics Lab software. The designer responds by suggesting prioritizing other sections first and gathering more opinions before starting on mechanics. Another user (P4231) asks about downloading the software, and the designer shares an image and announces an upcoming update related to battery simulations.

Notes: The conversation highlights the interactions between users and developers in an online community focused on developing and improving the Physics Lab software. Users request features, seek information, and express gratitude, while developers prioritize tasks, gather feedback, share updates, and improve the software based on user input. This collaborative process contributes to the emergence and growth of the online community around the Physics Lab project.

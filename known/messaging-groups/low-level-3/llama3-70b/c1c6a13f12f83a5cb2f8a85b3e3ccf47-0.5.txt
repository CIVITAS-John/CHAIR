You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
Tags should be descriptive of the event and its context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

Thoughts: For this conversation, I'll focus on the initial interactions between designers and users, exploring how they set the tone for the online community. I'll consider the role of designers as facilitators, the importance of user identities, and the emergence of community norms. How do designers' responses influence user engagement, and what do user requests reveal about their needs and expectations?

Tags for each message:
1. (no text, just an image)
2. Avatar customization; user profile management; community norms
3. Platform inquiry; PC version availability
4. Avatar upload; designer support; user inquiry
5. User identity; teacher role; community demographics

Summary: The conversation begins with a designer sharing an image, followed by a user requesting guidance on uploading a high-definition avatar. The designer offers assistance and inquires about the user's profession, revealing a teacher. This exchange establishes a supportive tone and highlights the importance of user identities and avatar customization in the online community.

Notes: The designers' proactive support and the user's request for a PC version suggest a focus on accessibility and inclusivity. The teacher's presence implies a potential interest in educational applications of Physics Lab. I hypothesize that the community's growth will be influenced by the designers' responsiveness to user needs and the emergence of diverse user roles.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

6.
Label: sharing information about teaching experience
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

7.
Label: request feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

8.

12.
Label: suggests technical solution
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

13.
Label: explaining design goals
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

14.
Label: providing feedback on software effectiveness
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

15.
Label: balancing realism with usability
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

16.
Label: thank users for participation
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

17.
Label: ensuring user satisfaction
Quotes:

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: valuing learning from ai, appreciating ai's learning capabilities
- Valuing the learning opportunities provided by AI.
- Interviewees appreciate and recognize AI's capabilities in learning and error handling.

2.
Concepts: implement ai suggestions, suggest ai improvements
- Participants implement AI suggestions, appreciating iterative improvement.
- Participants suggest improvements in error feedback and propose improvements for novice AI interaction.

3.
Concepts: human-effort(negative): learning curve, acknowledging the learning curve for ai-driven interfaces
- The code captures instances where the interviewee mentions the learning curve of using the LLM-driven interface.
- The participant acknowledges a learning curve in understanding the AI-driven interface, and they mention the learning curve associated with using AI-driven interfaces, emphasizing the need for a gradual learning curve, and they recognize the complexity of the AI interface and the need for a learning curve.

4.
Concepts: seek targeted ai assistance
- Participants who seek targeted AI assistance.
- Participants proactively seek help and assistance from AI to address specific needs.

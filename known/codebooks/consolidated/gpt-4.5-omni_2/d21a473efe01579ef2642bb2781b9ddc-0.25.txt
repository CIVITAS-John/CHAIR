You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: mentions learning curve, human-effort (negative): learning curve
- Users mention the perceived difficulty and effort required to learn and effectively use the LLM-driven interface.
- Users mention the learning curve associated with using AI.

2.
Concepts: values ai utility, values ai time-saving
- Users perceive AI's ability to save time and effort in coding tasks positively.
- Users perceive that AI can significantly reduce the time required to complete tasks.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: mentions learning curve, human-effort (negative): learning curve
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both address the perceived difficulty and effort involved in learning the LLM-driven interface.
Criteria: Users discuss the perceived difficulty and effort required to learn and effectively use the LLM-driven interface.
Phrase: Highlighting learning challenges

2. 
Concepts: values ai utility, values ai time-saving
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both emphasize the positive aspects of AI in terms of utility and time-saving.
Criteria: Users express positive perceptions of AI's ability to save time and effort in coding tasks.

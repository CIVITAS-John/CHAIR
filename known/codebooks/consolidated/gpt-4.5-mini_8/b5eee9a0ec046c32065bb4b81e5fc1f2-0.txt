You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: use cases, describe typical use cases
- Specific ways in which the interviewee uses the LLM-driven interface to support their work.
- Users describe typical scenarios in which they utilize the AI for coding assistance.

2.
Concepts: warns against blind reliance on ai, evaluate ai suggestions critically
- Users warn against blindly following AI suggestions without understanding the underlying issues.
- Users advise applying personal judgment when interpreting AI suggestions and warn about potential errors.

3.
Concepts: reflect on novices' struggles, reflect on novice challenges
- Interviewees consider the challenges novices face in programming and debugging.
- Interviewees reflect on the challenges faced by novices in understanding and using AI tools.

4.
Concepts: mentions learning curve, discuss learning curve challenges
- The perceived difficulty and effort required to learn and effectively use the LLM-driven interface.
- Users discuss the challenges of the learning curve associated with using AI tools.

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. 
Concepts: use cases, describe typical use cases
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both focus on the specific scenarios and contexts in which the interviewees apply the LLM-driven interface for their work.
Criteria: Interviewees identify and explain specific scenarios where they utilize the LLM-driven interface to enhance their coding tasks.
Phrase: Illustrate practical applications of the LLM interface.

2. 
Concepts: warns against blind reliance on ai, evaluate ai suggestions critically
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as they both emphasize the importance of critical thinking and personal judgment when interacting with AI suggestions.
Criteria: Users express caution about uncritically accepting AI recommendations and advocate for a thoughtful evaluation of those suggestions.
Phrase: Advocate for critical assessment of AI outputs.

3. 
Concepts: reflect on novices' struggles, reflect on novice challenges
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve the interviewees' contemplation of the difficulties faced by novices in programming and their interaction with AI tools.
Criteria: Interviewees analyze and discuss the specific challenges that novices encounter in programming and when using AI interfaces.
Phrase: Analyze novice difficulties in programming.

4. 
Concepts: mentions learning curve, discuss learning curve challenges
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as they both address the perceived difficulties and obstacles associated with mastering the LLM-driven interface.
Criteria: Users articulate the challenges and efforts required to learn and effectively utilize the LLM-driven interface.
Phrase: Discuss challenges of mastering the learning curve.

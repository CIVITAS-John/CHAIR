You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P4233: May I ask?
Preliminary tags: request for permission; respectful engagement; user initiative
2. P8: Group sharing.
Preliminary tags: community collaboration; group activity suggestion; sharing initiative
3. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
Preliminary tags: download instructions provided; windows platform support; direct response
4. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
Preliminary tags: feature update announcement; user feedback solicitation; development plans disclosure
5. P4234: [Emoji 56]
Preliminary tags: emoji
6. P4232: [Emoji 57][Emoji 57]
Preliminary tags: repeated emojis; expressing agreement or enthusiasm; non verbal feedback
7. P4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer: Hello :)
9. P4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer: [Image 61] Updates in progress
11. Designer: This one is more complicated, so it will take some more time... Hopefully it will be ready for release this week
12. Designer: There will be: multimeter; energized screw tube; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem solving and middle school teaching)
13. P4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer: Have you encountered any problems during your use?
15. Designer: We try to design it to be usable without additional instructions, or we will provide some tips when you first open it based on feedback
16. P4235: Mainly for schools to build information technology schools
17. P4235: Need a user manual for this software
18. Designer: Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?
19. P4232: This is great, hoping it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams. Also, it would be great to have a function to hide the background grid with one click, making it easier for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no convenient software for drawing circuit diagrams for circuit-related questions.
20. Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later
22. P4235: You can also include mechanics experiments
23. Designer: For example, after connecting the physical diagram, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics is figured out; it will take some time
25. P4232: Oh, that's good
26. Designer: I hope to figure out electromagnetics before the end of the year
27. P4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do exercises in the application
29. P4234: It's starting to take shape [Emoji 80]
30. Designer: For example, connecting the circuit diagram to see the physical diagram, or vice versa
31. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer: Hmm.
33. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
34. P4232: Indeed
35. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
36. Designer: I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
37. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
38. P4232: This is a really good idea
39. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
40. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?
[Image 91]
41. Designer: [Image 92]This one.
42. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.

Thoughts: The conversation revolves around updates and feedback for the Physics Lab software, focusing on user engagement and the integration of user suggestions into the development process. The dialogue between the Designer and the users (P4232, P4233, P4234, P4235) highlights an active community contributing towards the evolution of the software. It's essential to analyze how the Designer solicits feedback, how users express their needs and suggestions, and the responsiveness of the Designer to these inputs. This will help understand the dynamics of community building in a technical development context. Additionally, analyzing the types of updates discussed and the features requested can offer insights into the user base’s needs and how well the Designer is addressing these needs. The use of emojis and casual language also suggests a friendly and informal community atmosphere, which might contribute to more open communication and engagement.

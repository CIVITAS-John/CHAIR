You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: define ai tasks, defining ai-driven goals
- Participants set and define tasks for AI assistance, providing initial inputs and parameters.
- Participants use AI to achieve specific goals or objectives by providing a clear goal for the AI-driven system.

2.
Concepts: refining tasks for better ai results, simplifying tasks for ai comprehension
- Participants refine tasks with additional requirements and refine task descriptions for better results.
- Participants simplify tasks or requests to enhance comprehension or get a better response from the AI.

3.
Concepts: plotting model outputs, engage with ai output
- The participant plots model outputs.
- Participants engage with AI output, analyzing responses for model plotting.

4.
Concepts: seeking clarification and feedback, requesting clarification and verification
- Users clarify or seek clarification on errors or parameters.
- Users ask for clarification on AI-generated code and request verification or confirmation of AI-generated code.

5.
Concepts: abandon ai assistance, abandoning ai assistance
- Participants give up on AI assistance, returning to previous approaches.
- Participants abandon AI assistance when their expectations are not met, abandoning tasks and AI interaction.

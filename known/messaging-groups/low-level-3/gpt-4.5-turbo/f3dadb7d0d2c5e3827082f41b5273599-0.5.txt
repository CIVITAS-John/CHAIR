You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer: Done.
Preliminary tags: completion confirmation; response from designer; task completion
2. P5: Good ðŸ˜‚
Preliminary tags: positive feedback; social interaction; use of emoji
3. P8: @Designer  we need an admin here.
Preliminary tags: request for moderation; tagging designer; call for administrative action
4. P13: Are all the members in this group top students?
Preliminary tags: inquiry about group composition; social interaction; seeking information
5. P14: Except me.
Preliminary tags: self deprecating humor; social interaction; expressing individuality
6. P13: ï¼‹1
Preliminary tags: agreement with previous message; social interaction; supportive response
7. P15: Plus one more.
8. P16: ï¼‹1
9. P10: May I ask what does "+1" mean?
10. P11: It means "me too".

Thoughts: The conversation snippets provided seem to revolve around social interactions and community norms within the Physics Lab's online community. The key focus here would be understanding how members communicate informally and formally, establish roles (like asking for an admin), and how humor and expressions of agreement or identity play a role in the community dynamics. It would be interesting to see how these interactions contribute to the sense of community and learning among members. Also, examining how newcomers seek clarification and how other members provide explanations can shed light on the participatory nature and inclusivity of the community.

Tags for each message:
1. completion confirmation; response from designer; task completion
2. positive feedback; social interaction; use of emoji
3. request for moderation; tagging designer; call for administrative action
4. inquiry about group composition; social interaction; seeking information
5. self-deprecating humor; social interaction; expressing individuality
6. agreement with previous message; social interaction; supportive response
7. agreement expression; social interaction; community engagement
8. expression of agreement; social interaction; community involvement
9. inquiry about community slang; seeking clarification; participant engagement
10. explanation of term; community support; informative response

Summary: The conversation starts with the designer confirming the completion of a task, followed by positive feedback from participant P5 using an emoji, highlighting a friendly atmosphere. The request for administrative presence by P8 indicates a need for structured roles within the community. Participants P13, P14, P15, and P16 demonstrate a common form of agreement and humor, which might suggest a norm or inside joke within the community, as evidenced by P10's inquiry about the meaning of "+1" and P11's explanation. This sequence of interactions showcases how community members engage with each other, establish common understandings, and support newcomers.

Notes: The use of "+1" as a form of agreement and its subsequent clarification for a new member highlights a key aspect of community culture and norm-setting. The informal tone and humor could indicate a comfortable environment conducive to learning and participation. The tagging of the designer for administrative needs suggests that there are recognized roles and possibly a hierarchy or structured form of governance within the community. This interaction provides insights into how community norms are established and communicated, and how roles within the community might be perceived and enacted.

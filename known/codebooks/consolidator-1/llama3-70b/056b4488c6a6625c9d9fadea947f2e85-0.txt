You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging? 
  Yes, categories 1, 6, and 26 could be merged into a single category, as they all relate to the community and its governance.

- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split? 
  No, the merged categories seem to be well-defined and distinct.

- Is any naming inaccurate? 
  No, the naming seems accurate and concise.

# Final Merging
* affective learning outcomes
* community governance
* physics lab features
=> Community Development (15 codes)

* (rest of the merged categories remain the same)

Note: The final merging plan is an iterative process, and further refinement may be necessary based on the research context and the codes.

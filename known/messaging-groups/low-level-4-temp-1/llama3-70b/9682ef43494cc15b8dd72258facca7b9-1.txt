You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (10 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
10. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary phrases: sharing personal background; establishing credibility
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
Preliminary phrases: providing development updates; managing user expectations
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
Preliminary phrases: apologizing for inconvenience; demonstrating empathy
4. User-4233: How to download?
Preliminary phrases: seeking clarification; expressing confusion
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary phrases: expressing politeness; showing respect
6. Designer-2: Group sharing.
Preliminary phrases: introducing new feature idea; expanding system capabilities
7. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
9. User-4234: [Emoji 2-56]
10. User-4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]

Thoughts: For this initial round of coding, I'll focus on identifying key phrases that capture the essence of each message, considering the context of the online community's emergence. I'll draw on learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to analyze the conversation. Guiding questions include: What are the designers' and users' intents behind their messages? How do they interact with each other, and what do their interactions reveal about the community's dynamics?

Interpretations for each message:
1. sharing personal background; establishing credibility;
2. providing development updates; managing user expectations;
3. apologizing for inconvenience; demonstrating empathy;
4. seeking clarification; expressing confusion;
5. expressing politeness; showing respect;
6. introducing new feature idea; expanding system capabilities;
7. providing instructions; offering support;
8. soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; outlining development roadmap;
9. expressing enthusiasm; showing appreciation;
10. expressing excitement; indicating engagement;

Summary: The conversation begins with a user sharing their background, which could be seen as an icebreaker or an attempt to establish credibility. The designers then provide updates on the development process, set expectations, and apologize for any inconvenience caused. Users ask questions, express politeness, and show respect, while designers introduce new features, offer support, and solicit feedback. The tone of the conversation is collaborative, with both parties demonstrating empathy and enthusiasm.

Notes: A few hypotheses emerge from this initial analysis. Firstly, the designers seem to be making an effort to build trust with the users by being transparent about the development process and apologizing for any issues. Secondly, users appear to be interested in participating in the development process, asking questions, and providing feedback. Finally, the conversation seems to be characterized by a sense of politeness, respect, and enthusiasm, which could be indicative of a positive and collaborative community dynamic. As the analysis continues, it will be essential to explore these hypotheses further and identify any power imbalances or tensions within the community.

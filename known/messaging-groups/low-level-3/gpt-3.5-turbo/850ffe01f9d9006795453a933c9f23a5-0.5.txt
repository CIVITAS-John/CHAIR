You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
9. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
Preliminary tags: community suggestions; experiments request
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
Preliminary tags: prioritization; content development
3. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: community feedback; content planning
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; community engagement
5. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
Preliminary tags: pc version download; inquiry
6. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
Preliminary tags: pc version download; feedback
7. Designer: [Image 14]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: The conversation revolves around the development and improvement of Physics Lab, with community members providing suggestions and feedback. The designer seems to be actively engaging with the community and considering their opinions in the content development process. Prioritization of topics and components within the lab is also being discussed.

Tags for each message:
1. community suggestions; experiments request; interactive demonstrations
2. prioritization; content development; curriculum planning
3. community feedback; content planning; community engagement
4. appreciation; community engagement; feedback
5. pc version download; inquiry; software accessibility
6. pc version download; feedback; software accessibility
7. visual content; image sharing; design update
8. component update; simulation adjustments; electrical circuits
9. component update; electrical circuits; lab equipment

Summary: The conversation includes suggestions and requests for dynamic demonstrations and experiments in Physics Lab, along with inquiries about downloading the PC version. The designer is actively engaging with the community, considering feedback, and updating components within the lab.

Notes: The community engagement and feedback seem to be integral to the development of Physics Lab, with the designer taking into account suggestions and making updates based on user input. Prioritization of topics and components reflects a structured approach to content development.

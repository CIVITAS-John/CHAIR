You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary phrases: politely asking for assistance with a download
2. Designer-2: Group sharing.
Preliminary phrases: hinting at a feature related to group sharing within physics lab
3. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
Preliminary phrases: providing instructions on downloading windows from the group files
4. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
Preliminary phrases: updating users on upcoming features and requesting input for further improvements in physics lab
5. User-4234: [Emoji 2-56]
Preliminary phrases: emoji
6. User-4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 using multiple emojis
7. User-4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer-1: Hello :)
9. User-4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer-1: [Image 2-61] Updates in preparation
11. Designer-1: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
12. Designer-1: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
13. User-4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer-1: What problems did you encounter during use?
15. Designer-1: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
16. User-4235: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school
17. User-4235: Need the user manual for this software
18. Designer-1: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
19. User-4232: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
20. Designer-1: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer-1: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
22. User-4235: Can you also include mechanics experiments?
23. Designer-1: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer-1: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
25. User-4232: Oh, this is nice
26. Designer-1: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
27. User-4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer-1: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application
29. User-4234: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji 2-80]
30. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
31. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer-1: Hmm.

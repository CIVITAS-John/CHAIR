You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: sharing professional background
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

2.
Label: striving for design perfection
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

3.
Label: providing information about downloading the windows version
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

4.
Label: update on review status
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

5.
Label: thinking about user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

6.
Label: feature request
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

7.
Label: shows consideration for users' time
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

8.
Label: use the metaphor of craftsmanship to refer to app development
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

9.
Label: communicating the priority of electromagnetism over mechanics for the time being
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

10.
Label: providing insight into common practices
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

11.
Label: describing development vision
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

12.
Label: anticipating potential forgetting
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

13.
Label: considering development advice
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm.

14.
Label: providing detailed suggestions
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

15.
Label: user input/feedback/suggestion with justifications
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

16.
Label: revealing technical difficulties
Quotes:
- User: How to download?

17.
Label: inquiring about technical infrastructure
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

18.
Label: detailing features
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

19.
Label: explaining technical requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

20.
Label: explaining that the school has disabled the network on classroom computers due to an incident with inappropriate content during a major open class
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

21.
Label: appreciating craftsmanship
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

22.
Label: sharing visual examples
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

23.
Label: establishing designer user dialogue
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

24.
Label: describing plans for a simulated experiment assessment feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

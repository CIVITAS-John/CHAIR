You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

2.
Label: design/feature suggestion
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

3.
Label: contextualizing response
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

4.
Label: elaboration of response
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

5.
Label: design rationale
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

6.
Label: user need
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

7.
Label: encouraging elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

8.
Label: design suggestion
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

9.
Label: product gap
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

10.
Label: current efforts
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

11.
Label: future update
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

12.
Label: elaboration of suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa

13.
Label: user satisifcation
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

14.
Label: explanation
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

15.
Label: expression of interest
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

16.
Label: ethusiasm
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- User: This idea is really good

17.
Label: teacher-admin interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

18.
Label: teacher response
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- User: Left side

19.
Label: teaching
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

20.
Label: comparison
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

21.
Label: uncensored version of the avatar
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

22.
Label: inquiring about the platform version that the avatar is being used on
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

23.
Label: offering to upload a new version of the avatar
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P4233: Excuse me.
2. P8: Group sharing.
3. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
4. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
5. P4234: [Emoji 2-56]
6. P4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]
7. P4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer: Hello :)
9. P4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer: [Image 2-61] Updates in preparation
11. Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
12. Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
13. P4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?
15. Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
16. P4235: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school
17. P4235: Need the user manual for this software
18. Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
19. P4232: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
20. Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
22. P4235: Can you also include mechanics experiments?
23. Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
25. P4232: Oh, this is nice
26. Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
27. P4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application
29. P4234: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji 2-80]
30. Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
31. P4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer: Hmm.
33. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
34. P4232: Indeed
35. Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry
36. Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
37. Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
38. P4232: This idea is really good
39. Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
40. Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
41. Designer: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
42. P4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

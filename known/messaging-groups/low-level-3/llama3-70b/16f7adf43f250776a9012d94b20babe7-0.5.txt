You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (10 in total):
1. {an interpretation of message 1}
...
10. {an interpretation of message 10}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary codes: user 4230 expresses gratitude; acknowledging the designer's effort; appreciation for designer's work
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary codes: user 4231 inquires about the pc/interactive whiteboard version of physics lab; seeking access to the platform; user's technical requirements
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary codes: user 4231 finds the group files; resolving their initial inquiry; user's self directed problem solving
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary codes: designer 1 announces a change in the simulation; removing ideal components to increase realism; simulation design decision
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary codes: designer 1 introduces a new component; the student power supply; supporting dc and ac; simulation feature update
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

Thoughts: I will analyze the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will look for instances of user engagement, designer responses, and community building. I will also explore how the designers' decisions and announcements influence the users' interactions and vice versa. 

Codes for each message:
1. User-4230 expresses gratitude; acknowledging the designer's effort; appreciation for designer's work
2. user 4231 inquires about the pc/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab; seeking access to the platform; user's technical requirements
3. user 4231 finds the group files; resolving their initial inquiry; user's self-directed problem solving
4. image sharing; designer 1 initiates visual communication
5. designer 1 announces a change in the simulation; removing ideal components to increase realism; simulation design decision
6. designer 1 introduces a new component; the student power supply; supporting dc and ac; simulation feature update
7. designer 1 solicits feedback; encouraging user participation; community engagement
8. user 4232 seeks guidance; technical inquiry; user's learning needs
9. user 4232 shares an image; unclear context; potential technical issue
10. designer 2 provides technical information; system compatibility; limitation of the platform

Summary: The conversation starts with users expressing gratitude and inquiring about the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab. The designers respond by sharing images and announcing changes to the simulation. The conversation then shifts to users seeking technical guidance and designers providing information about the platform's capabilities and limitations.

Notes: It appears that the users are interested in accessing and using the Physics Lab platform, and the designers are actively responding to their inquiries and announcing updates. The designers seem to be encouraging user participation and feedback, which may indicate a participatory design approach. I will continue to analyze the conversation to see how the designers' decisions and announcements influence the users' interactions and vice versa.

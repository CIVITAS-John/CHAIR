You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: acknowledged experts; requested specific content; detailed educational needs
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: outlined development priorities; explained project timeline; communicated future plans
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: planned to gather user opinions; expressed concern about memory; ensured inclusivity in planning
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: acknowledged gratitude; expressed appreciation; recognized designer's effort
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: used emoji to greet community; asked for download information; showed interest in platform access
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: confirmed finding information; expressed gratitude; acknowledged group resources
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Summary: The conversation begins with User-4230 acknowledging the expertise of the designers and requesting specific educational content related to mechanical waves and optical experiments. Designer-1 responds by outlining the current development priorities, emphasizing the focus on completing the electrical section before moving on to other areas, and indicating that user opinions will be gathered before starting on mechanics. User-4230 expresses gratitude and appreciation for the designers' efforts. User-4231 joins the conversation with a greeting and a question about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab, later confirming that they found the information in the group files and expressing gratitude. Designer-1 shares an image and provides updates on component changes, specifically regarding dry batteries and the student power supply, explaining the new features and functionalities.

Notes: The conversation highlights the active role of users in shaping the development of Physics Lab through specific requests and feedback. Designers demonstrate a structured approach to development, balancing user input with project constraints and timelines. Communication within the community is supportive and appreciative, fostering a collaborative environment. The use of visual aids and detailed updates by the designers enhances user understanding and engagement. Further analysis could explore how iterative feedback loops influence the design process and the impact of community interactions on the platform's evolution.

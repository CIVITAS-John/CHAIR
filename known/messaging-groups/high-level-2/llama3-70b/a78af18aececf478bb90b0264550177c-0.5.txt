Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation revolves around Designer-1 sharing plans and updates about the development of Physics Lab, specifically the addition of a function for simulated experiment assessment. The conversation also involves consulting with teachers in the group about circuit diagrams and gathering feedback.

* Plan
Our plan is to analyze this conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. We will examine how the designers engage with the community, gather feedback, and share updates about the development process. We will also explore how the community responds to these updates and provides feedback.

# Community Engagement
## Feedback Solicitation
Definition: Instances where designers ask for feedback or opinions from the community.
- "Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?"
- "Make it simpler..."
- "So, use both?"

## Update Sharing
Definition: Instances where designers share updates about the development process.
- "For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details..."
- "The update is quite large..."
- "There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend."

## Appreciation and Gratitude
Definition: Instances where designers express gratitude or appreciation towards the community.
- "Thank you all for your support. We will do better!"

# Participatory Design
## Co-Design
Definition: Instances where designers involve the community in the design process.
- "Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?"
- "Make it simpler..."
- "So, use both?"

## Iterative Design
Definition: Instances where designers refine their design based on community feedback.
- "Make it simpler..."
- "So, use both?"

# Learning Sciences
## Domain Knowledge
Definition: Instances where domain-specific knowledge is shared or discussed.
- "Which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?"
- "The common one is still the old style"
- "Use the right side for non-crossing"

# Human-Computer Interaction
## Interface Design
Definition: Instances where the design of the interface is discussed or shown.
- "[Image 2-102]"
- "You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results"

Note: The codes can be refined and expanded as needed based on further analysis of the conversation.

Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation involves members of an online physics community discussing various topics related to physics simulations, models, and experiments. They share resources (images/multimedia), ask and answer questions, propose ideas, clarify concepts, and engage in casual conversation. There are instances of seeking and providing information, expressing opinions and reactions, referring to authorities or past events, considering practical limitations, and distinguishing between different approaches or types of models/equipment. The conversation also touches on technical aspects of physics, such as motors, power sources, and calculations.
1. P2: It's not a brushless motor that connects to AC.
2. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
3. P14: 
4. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
5. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
6. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
7. P14: [Image]
8. P2: Has it been burned?
9. P4: Just play a rotating animation if you turn on the power, that's it 23333.
10. P2: Do we still need algorithms?
11. P4: 2333, it's simple.
12. P2: Algorithms are not simple.
13. P2: IGDT can also add @Designer 
14. P13: [Image]
15. P13: Are you all fake?
16. P13: Are you from outer space?
17. P13: I don't understand.
18. P2: Transistors can also be used.
19. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do normal experiments like this...
20. P11: 233 is in electronic circuits.
21. P11: I don't understand either.
22. P2: In the CPU.
23. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned some when I took an optional course in circuits.
24. P2: Add a bipolar capacitor.
25. P2: I learned by myself.
26. P11: That's great, if you have hobbies in it.
27. P14: @P11 Are there still distinctions between arts and sciences now?
28. P2: no
29. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
30. P14: [Image]

Summary: The conversation involves members of an online physics community discussing various technical topics related to physics simulations and models. There is a mix of casual conversation, sharing of multimedia resources, seeking and providing information, expressing opinions and reactions, and referring to external knowledge or resources. Some members express confusion or lack of understanding, while others attempt to clarify concepts or suggest alternative approaches. There are instances of disagreement, dismissive comments, and rhetorical questions. The conversation also touches on broader philosophical questions and community norms.

Notes: The conversation highlights the diverse backgrounds and levels of understanding among community members, as well as their willingness to share knowledge and resources. While there are some instances of disagreement or dismissive comments, the overall tone seems to be one of open discussion and exploration. The community appears to be a space where members can ask questions, propose ideas, and engage in both technical discussions and more philosophical musings. The sharing of multimedia resources and references to external knowledge or past events suggests a rich and interconnected community with a shared history and body of knowledge.

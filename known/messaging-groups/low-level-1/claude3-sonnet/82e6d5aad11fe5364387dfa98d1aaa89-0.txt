Summary: This conversation involves members of an online community discussing roles, group identity, and establishing norms around expressions like "+1". There is some humor and self-deprecation. Members ask questions to understand unfamiliar norms and others provide explanations to help set those norms.

Notes: The conversation suggests an emerging online community where members are starting to establish roles (e.g. admin), group identity (top students or not), norms around expressions like "+1", and a supportive environment where questions can be asked and humor is present. The dynamics point to the early stages of forming an online community with shared understanding and norms.

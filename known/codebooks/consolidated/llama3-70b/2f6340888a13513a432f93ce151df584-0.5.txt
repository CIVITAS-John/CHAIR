1.
Label: addressing technology challenges in education
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

2.
Label: engaging and supporting users
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

3.
Label: discussing software compatibility and updates
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

4.
Label: requesting specialized experiments and features
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

5.
Label: planning topic development
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

6.
Label: enhancing software functionality and user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.

Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

# Special Tips
The Esc shortcut key will now minimize the window.
The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

7.
Label: enhancing touch screen compatibility
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

8.
Label: updating the platform
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: The update is quite large...

Label: enhancing tool functionality through user collaboration
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

14.
Label: simplifying and refining features
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout
- Designer: Make it simpler...

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: setting user expectations, setting release expectations
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both involve designers managing user expectations, with one focused on development/functionality and the other on release timelines.
Criteria: Designers set expectations with users about project development and release timelines.
Phrase: Setting user expectations.

2.
Concepts: responding to user context, providing user context
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they involve a reciprocal exchange of context between users and designers, with users providing context and designers responding to it.
Criteria: Users provide context, and designers respond to user needs and concerns.
Phrase: Responding to user context.

3.
Concepts: suggesting prioritization, proposing new features
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both involve users providing input on the development of Physics Lab, with one focused on prioritization and the other on proposing new ideas.
Criteria: Users suggest prioritization and propose new features or functionalities for Physics Lab.
Phrase: Proposing new features.

4.
Concepts: list new features, introduce new features
Relationship: The two concepts are related as they both involve designers informing users about new features or updates in Physics Lab, with one focused on listing and the other on introducing.
Criteria: Designers inform users about new features, updates, or functionalities in Physics Lab.
Phrase: Introducing new features.

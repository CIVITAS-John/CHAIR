1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: share workaround; provide practical advice; reflect on past experience
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: confirm understanding; agree with suggestion; acknowledge designer's point
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: propose additional features; emphasize convenience; suggest practical use case
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: confirm future implementation; validate user request; plan feature development
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquire about classroom conditions; gather context; consider technical requirements
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: explain lack of internet; provide context; share past incident
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Summary: The conversation showcases an active exchange between a designer and users of the Physics Lab platform. Designer-1 shares a workaround for a browser issue, leading User-4232 to propose new features for exporting and saving experiments, highlighting the need for offline functionality due to internet restrictions in schools. Designer-1 confirms future implementation of these features and inquires about classroom conditions, learning that internet access is often disabled to prevent distractions. User-4232 praises the software's simulation effect, sharing classroom success, and providing background on their teaching experience. Designer-1 updates on the software's version status and apologizes for any inconvenience caused by late-night messages. User-4233 inquires about downloading the software, and Designer-2 suggests group sharing as a solution.

Notes: The conversation highlights the importance of user feedback in shaping the development of Physics Lab. The designers are responsive to practical issues faced by users, such as the lack of internet access in classrooms, and are working on features to address these needs. The community appears to be a collaborative space where users share experiences and suggestions, and designers actively engage to improve the platform. The participatory design approach is evident, with users' real-world contexts significantly influencing design decisions.

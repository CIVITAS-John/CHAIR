1. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
Preliminary tags: self disclosure of educational stage; sharing personal context
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
Preliminary tags: technical inquiry; component discussion
3. P2: @Designer 
Preliminary tags: direct engagement with designer; seeking input
4. P17: [Image 198]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
Preliminary tags: questioning chemical usage; seeking clarification
6. P2: +1
Preliminary tags: agreement expressed; supporting comment
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken.
8. P14: [Image 202]
9. P14: What do you mean?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top. 233333
11. P14: The condensed liquid won't flow back, right?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh, I see.
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year.
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be about electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay.
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
32. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
33. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
34. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
35. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
36. P11: Hey, good idea.
37. P2: Hehe.
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
39. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
40. Designer: The question is,
41. Designer: Where does the light come from?
42. P11: What about light?
43. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
44. P2: Touch it with your hand.
45. P14: I think there's no problem.
46. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
47. P2: And a small light.
48. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 245]
52. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
53. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
54. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
55. P1: Let's put up some ads.
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
58. Designer: Oh.
59. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).
60. P11: 23333
61. P11: I was just about to say.
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
63. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
64. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...

1. Designer: For the electrical side, I plan to add a simulated experiment assessment function; it will include many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, it will only be useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use regularly)
2. P4232: This is a really good idea
3. Designer: When preparing to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer: Asking the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in textbooks? [Image 91]
5. Designer: [Image 92] This one
6. P4234: Yes, the common one or the old-fashioned one.
7. Designer: Um... left or right?
8. Designer: We are working on this.
9. P4234: Left side.
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Keep it simple...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side without crossing.
13. Designer: So, should we use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, which may produce some weird results.
15. Designer: [Image 102]
16. Designer: Thank you for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 104]
18. Designer: There will be an update. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version next weekend.
19. Designer: The update is quite substantial...

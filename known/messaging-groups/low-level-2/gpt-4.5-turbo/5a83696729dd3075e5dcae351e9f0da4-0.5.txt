You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P8: [Image]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.
6. Designer: 
7. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are in the group announcement.
8. Designer: Feel free to share any suggestions and needs.
9. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
10. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
11. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
12. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
13. P4231: [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
14. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.

Thoughts: The conversation appears to be centered around the development and use of a particular Physics Lab software, with various participants including a designer and users providing feedback or asking for help. The focus will be on identifying tags related to the nature of the interaction (e.g., requests, feedback, technical support) and the roles of the participants (e.g., designer, user).

Analysis for all 14 messages:
1. image sharing; non-verbal communication
2. technical question; seeking help; addressing individual
3. clarification question; software-specific inquiry
4. feedback solicitation; role inquiry
5. role confirmation
6. no content
7. announcement; information sharing; call for feedback
8. feedback solicitation; openness to suggestions
9. detailed request; respect expression; subject-specific needs
10. prioritization; project management; feedback response
11. planning; memory concern; feedback consideration
12. acknowledgment; appreciation
13. initial inquiry; greeting; software-specific inquiry
14. self-help; follow-up; gratitude expression

Summary: The conversation showcases a collaborative environment within the Physics Lab's online community, where users and the designer interact to enhance and troubleshoot the software. The designer plays a central role in responding to queries and managing the development priorities, while users actively engage by asking questions, making requests, and providing feedback.

Notes: The tags reflect a mixture of technical support, development feedback, and social interaction, illustrating the emergence of a supportive and engaged online community around the Physics Lab software. The conversation provides insights into how community members use the platform to solve problems and contribute to the software’s development.

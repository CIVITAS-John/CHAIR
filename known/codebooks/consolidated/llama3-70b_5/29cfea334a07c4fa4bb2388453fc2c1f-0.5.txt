You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa

8.
Label: plans sequential content development
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

9.
Label: justifying development priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

18.
Label: suggesting the use of internal resistance simulation
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

19.
Label: the community seems to function as both a support network and a channel for user driven development
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

20.
Label: responds with friendliness
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

21.

Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

23.
Label: providing comfort
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

24.
Label: explaining development plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

25.
Label: aims to finalize electromagnetism understanding by year end
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

26.
Label: expressing interest in specific topics
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

27.
Label: leaves room for exploration
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

28.
Label: reiterating the bidirectional conversion concept
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

29.
Label: question
Quotes:

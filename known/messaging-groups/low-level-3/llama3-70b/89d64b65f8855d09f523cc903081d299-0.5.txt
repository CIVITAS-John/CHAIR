You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (5 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...
...
5. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on identifying the actors, their actions, and intentions. I'll explore the context of the conversation, the roles of the designers and users, and the emerging themes related to the online community. Guiding questions include: What are the designers' and users' goals and motivations? How do they interact with each other and the platform? What are the initial impressions of the community's tone and dynamics?

Codes for each message:
1. 
	* Image sharing; Designer-2's intent unknown
2. 
	* Avatar customization; Uncensored content request; Technical inquiry
3. 
	* Platform inquiry; PC version interest
4. 
	* Avatar upload; User identification inquiry; Teacher role
5. 
	* Affirmation; Teacher role confirmation

Summary: The conversation begins with an image shared by Designer-2, followed by Designer-1's response to a user's inquiry about uploading a high-definition avatar. The user, who is a teacher, expresses interest in a PC version of the platform. The designers and users are interacting, discussing technical aspects and customization options.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, addressing their concerns, and exploring customization options. The tone of the conversation is informal, with a focus on technical aspects and user experience. The community is still in its early stages, and the designers seem to be shaping the platform's features and tone.

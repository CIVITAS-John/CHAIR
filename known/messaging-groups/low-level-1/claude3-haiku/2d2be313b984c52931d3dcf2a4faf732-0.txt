Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation demonstrates the emergence of an online community where members engage in knowledge-sharing, problem-solving, and social interactions related to physics and space-related topics. The participants discuss various concepts and design considerations for a project, while also engaging in social interactions such as asking for information, providing explanations, and expressing opinions. The community members take on different roles, such as the designer, the problem-solver, and the information seeker, and they collaborate to address the challenges and questions that arise.
1. P2: It's not a brushless motor that connects to AC.
2. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
3. P14: 
4. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
5. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
6. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
7. P14: [Image]
8. P2: Has it been burned?
9. P4: Just play a rotating animation if you turn on the power, that's it 23333.
10. P2: Do we still need algorithms?
11. P4: 2333, it's simple.
12. P2: Algorithms are not simple.
13. P2: IGDT can also add @Designer 
14. P13: [Image]
15. P13: Are you all fake?
16. P13: Are you from outer space?
17. P13: I don't understand.
18. P2: Transistors can also be used.
19. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do normal experiments like this...
20. P11: 233 is in electronic circuits.
21. P11: I don't understand either.
22. P2: In the CPU.
23. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned some when I took an optional course in circuits.
24. P2: Add a bipolar capacitor.
25. P2: I learned by myself.
26. P11: That's great, if you have hobbies in it.
27. P14: @P11 Are there still distinctions between arts and sciences now?
28. P2: no
29. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
30. P14: [Image]

Thoughts: The conversation so far focuses on the technical aspects of building an electric motor, with participants discussing various components and concepts like brushless motors, transistors, and algorithms. There are also some social interactions, such as participants expressing confusion or understanding, and one participant questioning whether the others are "fake" or from "outer space". To analyze the emergence of the online community, I will focus on identifying the different roles and interactions between the participants, as well as any patterns or themes that emerge related to the community-building process.

Summary: The conversation demonstrates the emergence of an online community where members engage in knowledge-sharing, problem-solving, and social interactions related to physics and space-related topics. The participants take on different roles, such as the designer, the problem-solver, and the information seeker, and they collaborate to address the challenges and questions that arise. The community members express varying levels of understanding and confusion, and they provide advice and explanations to help each other.

Notes: The conversation shows the participants engaging in technical discussions about building an electric motor, with a focus on problem-solving and sharing knowledge. There are also social interactions, where participants express understanding, confusion, and questioning, and provide encouragement and clarification. The community members seem to have different levels of expertise, and they work together to address the challenges they face. The conversation suggests that the online community is still in the early stages of formation, with participants exploring and learning from each other.

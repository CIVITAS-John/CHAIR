You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary phrases: announcing the transition from dry batteries to an ideal student power supply component; suggesting an iterative design process
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary phrases: providing details about the student power supply component; further elaborating on the platform's features
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary phrases: inviting users to provide more suggestions; indicating a desire for user feedback and participation
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about the usage of the pc version; demonstrating interest in understanding the platform's functionality
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary phrases: informing the user that the platform does not support the xp system; indicating the designers' awareness of platform limitations
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

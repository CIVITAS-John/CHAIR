You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (5 in total):
1. {an interpretation of message 1}
...
5. {an interpretation of message 5}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

Thoughts: In this initial coding round, I'll focus on identifying the actors, their intents, and the events unfolding in the conversation. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective to understand how the online community is emerging. I'll also draw on human-computer interaction principles to analyze the designers' and users' interactions. From a participatory design perspective, I'll examine how the designers and users are collaborating to shape the online community.

Codes for each message:

1. Designer-2 shares an image, potentially sparking conversation or setting the tone for the community (Image Sharing, Community Building);
2. Designer-1 requests help with uploading a high-definition avatar, revealing technical difficulties and a desire for self-presentation (Technical Issue, Self-Expression);
3. User-4229 inquires about a PC version, indicating interest in the platform's compatibility (Platform Inquiry, Technical Interest);
4. Designer-1 responds to User-4229, uploading a new avatar and asking about their profession, demonstrating a willingness to engage and understand the user's context (Avatar Update, User Engagement);
5. User-4229 self-identifies as a teacher, providing context for their interest in the platform (User Context, Professional Role);

Summary: The conversation begins with an image shared by Designer-2, followed by Designer-1's technical issue with uploading an avatar. User-4229 shows interest in the platform's PC version, and Designer-1 responds by uploading a new avatar and inquiring about the user's profession. User-4229 reveals their role as a teacher, providing context for their engagement with the platform.

Notes: The designers seem to be actively engaging with users, addressing technical issues, and showing interest in understanding their context. This suggests a collaborative approach to building the online community. The user's professional role as a teacher may influence their expectations and interactions with the platform.

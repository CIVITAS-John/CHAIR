Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...

1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Hello
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: There will be more people here once the official version is released.
5. Designer: Probably because the teacher finds too much talking annoying ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image 1-6]
8. P5: ðŸ˜‚ By the way, I'm here to see if there are any good designs to reference.
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: For example, a microcomputer.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab's online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a casual greeting from P2, followed by the Designer's introduction and a comment about the expected increase in users once the official version is released. The conversation then shifts to a discussion about design, with P5 expressing interest in referencing good designs and P6 providing an example of a microcomputer.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do participants establish a sense of community and norms in this online space? How do designers and users interact and influence each other? What role do references to external designs or examples play in shaping the community's understanding of good design?

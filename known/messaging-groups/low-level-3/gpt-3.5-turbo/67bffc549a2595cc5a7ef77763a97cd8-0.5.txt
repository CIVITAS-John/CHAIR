You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (15 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
15. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary tags: component update; simulation adjustments; electrical circuits
2. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.
Preliminary tags: component update; electrical circuits; lab equipment
3. Designer: Okay. Please give me more suggestions!
Preliminary tags: designer interaction; feedback solicitation
4. P4232: How to use the PC version?
Preliminary tags: pc version usage; software instructions; inquiry
5. P4232: [Image 19]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
6. P8: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary tags: system compatibility; software limitation; technical issue
7. P4232: Oh, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. P4232: Can it run on Win7?
9. P8: Win7 should work.
10. P4232: Thank you.
11. P8: You're welcome. If you encounter any problems during use, feel free to discuss them directly in the group.
12. P4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to do everything and ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer: I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to set up a virtual machine.
14. Designer: In theory, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from around 2008 onwards).
15. Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, with the following updates:

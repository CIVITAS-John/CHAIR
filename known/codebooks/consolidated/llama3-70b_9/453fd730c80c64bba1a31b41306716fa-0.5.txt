You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: seeking guidance, seeking ai-assisted learning
- Participants seek guidance on how to create a specific model or functionality and seek specific guidance or NetLogo code assistance.
- Participants desire AI-assisted learning, recognize the need for AI support, and seek AI assistance for NetLogo development.

2.
Concepts: acknowledging ai's learning curve, identifying risks of ai-driven interfaces
- Participants express concerns and acknowledge the learning curve for AI tools.
- Participants identify risks associated with using AI-driven interfaces for novices and express concerns about blindly following AI.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: seeking guidance, seeking ai-assisted learning
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as seeking guidance on NetLogo development implies a desire for AI-assisted learning to overcome specific challenges.
Criteria: Participants seek guidance and AI-assisted learning to overcome specific NetLogo development challenges.
Phrase: Seeking AI-assisted guidance.

2.
Concepts: acknowledging ai's learning curve, identifying risks of ai-driven interfaces
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected, as acknowledging the learning curve for AI tools implies recognizing the risks associated with using AI-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge the learning curve and identify risks associated with using AI-driven interfaces for novices.
Phrase: Acknowledging AI-driven risks.

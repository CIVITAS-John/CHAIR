Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

* Summary
The conversation starts with a designer (Designer-2) sharing an image. Another designer (Designer-1) then asks how to upload a high-definition, uncensored version of an avatar, indicating they are trying to improve the avatar image. A user (User-4229) asks if the designer is referring to the PC version, and the designer confirms they will upload a new version. The user then reveals they are a teacher.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can focus on the following:

1. **Learning Sciences**: Examine the designers' efforts to improve the avatar image and their interaction with the user, who is a teacher. This could provide insights into how the online community is being designed to support learning and engagement.

2. **Human-Computer Interaction**: Analyze the technical aspects of the avatar upload process and the designers' responsiveness to the user's needs. This could reveal design choices and considerations for improving the user experience.

3. **Participatory Design**: Explore the level of user involvement and the designers' willingness to incorporate feedback, as seen in the designer's response to the user's question about the PC version. This could indicate the community's approach to collaborative design.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (32 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

11.
Label: referenced personal experience
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

12.
Label: consulted teachers on circuit diagram standards
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

17.
Label: hypothesize compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

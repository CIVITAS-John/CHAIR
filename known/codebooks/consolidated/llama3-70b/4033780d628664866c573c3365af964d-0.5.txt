You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (13 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: future design plans/considerations
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

2.
Label: no elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
- Designer: Group sharing.
- User: Left side
- User: Yes.

3.
Label: understanding designers' situation
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

4.
Label: share visual update
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

5.
Label: give an intro to the update content
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

6.
Label: express contemplation
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm.

7.
Label: inform about new version availability
Quotes:
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group

8.
Label: respond to the feature request
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

9.
Label: implicit rejection
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

10.
Label: further suggestion
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

11.
Label: promise that the update is ongoing

You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between sub-codes. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

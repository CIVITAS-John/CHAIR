You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: challenges faced by novices, reflect on novices' struggles
- Interviewee reflects on the challenges faced by novices in understanding and using AI.
- Interviewees reflect on the struggles novices encounter when using AI for coding support.

2.
Concepts: reads and adapts ai responses, utilize ai-generated code in practice
- User reads and selectively adapts AI responses for their coding needs.
- Users dictate parameters to the AI and manually write code while referencing AI-generated outputs, and they decide to copy and paste AI-generated code for execution and selectively integrate relevant AI-generated code for their needs.

3.
Concepts: value timely feedback and documentation from ai, describe positive human-ai interactions in coding
- Users value and appreciate timely feedback from AI to support their coding efforts and recognize AI's ability to provide comments and documentation for code.
- Users describe positive experiences of using AI as a supportive tool in their coding process and successful experiences in automating coding tasks.

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. 
Concepts: challenges faced by novices, reflect on novices' struggles
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as both focus on the difficulties that novices experience, with the first emphasizing the specific challenges and the second highlighting the reflective aspect of those struggles.
Criteria: Interviewees reflect on the challenges faced by novices in understanding and using AI, as well as the struggles novices encounter when using AI for coding support.
Phrase: Reflect on novices' challenges in using AI.

2. 
Concepts: reads and adapts ai responses, utilize ai-generated code in practice
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as they both involve the process of engaging with AI-generated content, where users read, adapt, and apply AI responses to meet their coding needs.
Criteria: Users read and selectively adapt AI responses for their coding needs, dictating parameters to the AI, manually writing code while referencing AI-generated outputs, and deciding to copy and paste or integrate relevant AI-generated code.
Phrase: Adapt and utilize AI-generated code.

3. 
Concepts: value timely feedback and documentation from ai, describe positive human-ai interactions in coding
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both emphasize the beneficial aspects of AI in coding, with one focusing on the appreciation of feedback and documentation, and the other on the overall positive interactions experienced by users.
Criteria: Users value and appreciate timely feedback from AI to support their coding efforts, recognizing AI's ability to provide comments and documentation, while also describing positive experiences of using AI as a supportive tool in their coding process.
Phrase: Appreciate AI feedback and interactions.

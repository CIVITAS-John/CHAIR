You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: Thank you.
Preliminary tags: user appreciation; positive interaction
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary tags: encouragement of feedback; user support; open communication
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary tags: user satisfaction; practicality feedback; comparative praise
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary tags: consideration of future updates; technical challenges; user inclusivity
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary tags: compatibility speculation; technical advice; system requirements
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary tags: product update announcement; community notification; version detail sharing
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

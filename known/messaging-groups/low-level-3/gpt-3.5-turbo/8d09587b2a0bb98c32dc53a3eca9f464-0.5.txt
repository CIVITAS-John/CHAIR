You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in the Physics Lab online community continues to blend discussions on astronomy, software features, and user engagement with the designer. Participants explore topics like planetary comparisons, software inquiries, time constraints in project management, and humor intertwined with scientific concepts. The designer actively engages with users, discussing scale considerations in astronomy, software customization options, and future expansion plans for the platform.
1. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
Preliminary tags: humor; self deprecating comment
2. P11: Look it up online, this is not something that can be solved in a few words. @P2 
Preliminary tags: seeking detailed information; tagging another user
3. P2: Can we add a motor? @Designer 
Preliminary tags: feature request to designer
4. P14: I think I should focus on doing mathematics.
5. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
6. Designer: We will be relatively simple, practical (close to the exam), and affordable.
7. P11: 2333
8. P11: Ask the group owner.
9. Designer: After all, it's not specifically about astronomy.
10. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
11. P2: [Image 144]
12. P2: From what I know currently.
13. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in the Physics Lab?
14. Designer: Motor simulation is more complicated, and it depends on the load.
15. Designer: Calculated it...
16. P2: How was it calculated?
17. P11: Okay.
18. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
19. P11: [Image 152]
20. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but an atomized model.
21. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
22. P1: Server?
23. P11: Hahaha
24. Designer: Standalone.
25. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
26. Designer: Two types of motors.
27. P1: Are you going to the server?
28. P2: Brushed motor.
29. P2: It's not a brushless motor that connects to AC.
30. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
31. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
32. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
33. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
34. P14: [Image 168]
35. P2: Has it been burned?

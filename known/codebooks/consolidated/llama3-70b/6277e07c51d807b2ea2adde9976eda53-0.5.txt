You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. idea contribution, design ideation.
- Instances where participants suggest new ideas or features for the software.
- Instances where participants contribute ideas or suggestions for the design of the calculator or computer.

2. user contributions, user involvement.
- How users contribute to the design or improvement of educational tools or resources.
- Instances where participants actively contribute ideas, feedback, or suggestions for the development of the physics lab simulation software.

3. data display, discussion of lab resources.
- Conversations about displaying data from the experiment.
- Conversations that involve the management, utilization, or observation of physical resources in the lab.

4. understanding experiment setup, experiment design collaboration.
- Participants discussing the setup and operation of the experiment.
- Participants collectively contributing to the design and implementation of the experiment.

5. component connectivity, impedance consideration.
- Discussions related to connecting components in the experiment.
- Members discussing the consideration of impedance in their work

6. feedback and iteration, iterative experimentation and prototyping.
- Exchanges where feedback is given, leading to potential adjustments or rethinking of the experiment setup.
- Participants engage in a cycle of trying out ideas, evaluating the results, and making adjustments to improve the design.

7. experimentation, playful experimentation.
- The experimentation and testing of technological concepts within the community.
- Investigating how the community incorporates playful experimentation into their interactions.

8. collaboration, collaborative learning.
- Working together to solve problems or challenges
- Collaborative learning, problem-solving, and knowledge sharing

9. task coordination, collaborative decision-making.
- Instances where members coordinate tasks, assign responsibilities, or discuss project management aspects.
- Discussions where participants engage in collaborative decision-making processes or reach consensus.

10. co-construction, co-creating meaning.
- Building understanding together through dialogue
- Participants collaboratively construct meaning and understanding through their interactions and contributions.

11. designer-participant interaction, expressing interest and curiosity.
- The interactions between the designer and the participants, which can reveal the participatory nature of the design process.
- Participants demonstrate engagement and enthusiasm for the design process by asking questions, sharing ideas, and expressing interest in the outcomes.

12. expectation of growth, increase in participants.
- Anticipating or planning for the increase in community size or activity
- Codes related to discussions about the potential growth of the community.

13. joint exploration, conceptual development.
- The joint exploration of problems and solutions within the community.
- The collaborative development of design concepts within the community.

14. shared understanding, negotiating shared meaning.
- Developing a shared understanding among community members
- Instances where participants negotiate or clarify the meaning of shared expressions or norms within the community.

15. reflective thinking, community perception.
- Instances where community members reflect on their learning or understanding.
- Instances where participants express their perceptions of the community and its members

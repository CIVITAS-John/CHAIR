You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: enhancing experimental details
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

2.
Label: confirming update receipt
Quotes:
- User: Updated

3.
Label: expressing teaching needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

4.
Label: confirming commonality
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

5.
Label: explaining technical possibilities
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

6.
Label: considering broader implications
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

7.
Label: exploring options
Quotes:

11.
Label: specifying compatible operating systems
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

12.
Label: explaining ideal component simulation
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

13.

Label: explaining features
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

20.
Label: highlighting educational impact
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

21.
Label: reiterating diagram connection

22.
Label: sharing development plan and download address
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

23.
Label: sharing positive experience
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

24.
Label: providing clarification
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

25.
Label: emphasizing scope of changes
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

26.
Label: acknowledging support
Quotes:

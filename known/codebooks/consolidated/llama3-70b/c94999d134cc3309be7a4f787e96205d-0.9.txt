You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: encouraging the user to directly mention any problems encountered during use
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

2.
Label: maintaining friendly atmosphere
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

3.
Label: explaining the long term benefits of the circuit diagram feature optimization
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

4.
Label: comparing it to adding various components
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

5.
Label: user 4232 explains reasons behind schools disabling networks on classroom computers
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

6.
Label: i saw the group files
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

7.
Label: request technical help
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

8.
Label: user 4235 requests a user manual for the software
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

9.
Label: user 4230 acknowledges experts
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

10.
Label: future update
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

11.
Label: demonstrating enthusiasm for the platform

12.
Label: powered solenoid
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

13.
Label: sharing institutional context
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

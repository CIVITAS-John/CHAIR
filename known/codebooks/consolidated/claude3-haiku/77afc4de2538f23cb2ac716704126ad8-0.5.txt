You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* external resources and limitations
* scientific resources
* technical infrastructure
* knowledge exchange
* community engagement
* design-based learning
* learning experiences
* payment methods

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other.
Write clear and contextualized criteria to apply across quotes. Do not provide examples. Then, refine the label if necessary.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Thoughts:
* To categorize the codes, I will first group them into higher-level categories based on their relevance to the research question on how Physics Lab's online community emerged. 
* The categories should reflect the key aspects involved in an online community's emergence, such as social interactions, content and knowledge sharing, community norms and processes, and design considerations.
* Within each category, I will define the specific codes by providing clear criteria to distinguish them, while ensuring the labels accurately capture the essence of the codes.

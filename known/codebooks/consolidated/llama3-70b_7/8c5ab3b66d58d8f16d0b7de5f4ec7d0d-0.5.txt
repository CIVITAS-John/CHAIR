You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: identifies misleading ai suggestions, highlights confusion caused by misleading feedback
Relationship: The two concepts are causally related, as identifying misleading AI suggestions leads to highlighting the confusion caused by such feedback.
Criteria: Participants recognize and address the potential for AI-generated feedback to mislead or confuse users.
Phrase: Identifying and addressing misleading AI suggestions.

2.
Concepts: critiquing ai code quality and seeking error-free code, critiquing code-sharing practices and identifying submission issues
Relationship: The two concepts are related in that they both involve evaluating and refining AI-generated code, with the first concept focusing on code quality and the second on code-sharing practices.
Criteria: Participants evaluate and refine AI-generated code to ensure high-quality, error-free code and identify issues with code-sharing practices.
Phrase: Evaluating and refining AI-generated code.

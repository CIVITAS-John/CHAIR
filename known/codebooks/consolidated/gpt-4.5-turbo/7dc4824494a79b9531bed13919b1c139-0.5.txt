You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* evolution of design tools
* technical design integration
=> technical design evolution

* technology interaction
* user interaction
=> interaction dynamics

* community resource support
* technical support
* learning support
=> support mechanisms

* design development prioritization
* design process decisions
=> design decision-making

* role identification
* professional learning exchange
=> role and learning dynamics

# Reflection
- **More categories for merging**: The current merging has effectively grouped smaller categories into more comprehensive ones without creating overly large categories. However, the category "community feedback mechanisms" remains unmerged due to its larger size and specific focus, which might not directly align with the smaller categories left.
  
- **Over-merged categories**: The "support mechanisms" category merges community, technical, and learning supports. This could be considered over-merged if the distinctions between these types of supports are significant and relevant to the research question. A closer examination of the specific codes within these categories could clarify whether they should remain merged or be split.

- **Naming accuracy**: The names of the new categories like "technical design evolution" and "interaction dynamics" are accurate and reflect the combined aspects of the merged categories. "Support mechanisms" might be too broad or vague, depending on the specifics of the codes within the original categories.

Given the reflections, the final merging plan can be adjusted if needed to better align with the research question and the specificity of the data within each category.

# Final Merging
* evolution of design tools
* technical design integration
=> technical design evolution

* technology interaction
* user interaction
=> interaction dynamics

* community resource support
* technical support
* learning support
=> support mechanisms

* design development prioritization
* design process decisions
=> design decision-making

* role identification
* professional learning exchange
=> role and learning dynamics

The final merging plan maintains the initial groupings, as they are deemed appropriate based on the reflection. The naming remains specific and relevant, and no further splits are recommended without additional specific code data.

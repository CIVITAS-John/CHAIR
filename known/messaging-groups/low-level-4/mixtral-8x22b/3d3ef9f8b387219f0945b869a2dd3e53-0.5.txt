1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: requesting assistance with uploading a high definition avatar; expressing dissatisfaction with current avatar quality; seeking to improve visual representation within the community
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about a pc version of physics lab; indicating a preference for a specific platform; expressing interest in accessing physics lab
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: responding to user 4229's inquiry; offering to upload a high definition avatar; inquiring about user 4229's role within the community
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: confirming their role as a teacher; possibly indicating their motivation for using physics lab; highlighting the role of educators in the emerging community
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

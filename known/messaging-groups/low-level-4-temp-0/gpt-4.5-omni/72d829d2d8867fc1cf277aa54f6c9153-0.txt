You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: express respect for designers; request specific features; detail educational needs
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: outline development priorities; manage user expectations
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: plan to gather user opinions; acknowledge memory limitations; ensure future engagement
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: express gratitude; acknowledge designer efforts
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: use emoji to greet group; inquire about download information
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: confirm finding information; express gratitude
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: In analyzing this conversation, I will focus on understanding how the community members interact with the designers, how the designers manage user expectations, and how the community's needs and feedback shape the development of Physics Lab. I will also consider the role of participatory design in this process and how the designers incorporate user feedback into their development priorities. Key questions include: How do users express their needs and requests? How do designers respond to and prioritize these requests? How does the interaction between users and designers contribute to the evolution of the online community?

Summary: The conversation begins with User-4230 expressing respect for the designers and requesting specific features related to mechanical waves and optical experiments. Designer-1 responds by outlining the current development priorities, indicating that the electrical section will be completed first, followed by magnetism, and then other parts. Designer-1 also mentions the plan to gather user opinions before starting on mechanics to ensure all requests are remembered. User-4230 expresses gratitude for the designers' hard work. User-4231 joins the conversation with a greeting and a question about where to download the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab, later confirming they found the information in the group files and expressing thanks. Designer-1 shares an image and provides updates on component changes, explaining that dry batteries will no longer be ideal components and introducing a new student power supply that supports both DC and AC.

Notes: The conversation highlights the participatory design approach, with designers actively engaging with users to gather feedback and manage expectations. Users express their needs and gratitude, while designers provide updates and plan future engagements to ensure user requests are considered. This interaction fosters a collaborative community where user feedback directly influences the development of Physics Lab.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: iterative questioning
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the process of refining AI responses through multiple sequential questions.
Criteria: Participants engage in a process of asking multiple, sequential questions to refine AI responses and outputs.
Phrase: Refine AI responses through iteration.

2.
Concepts: ai hallucinations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they all describe instances of AI generating incorrect or fabricated information.
Criteria: Participants experience or describe instances where AI generates incorrect, non-existent, or fabricated information.
Phrase: Encounter AI-generated inaccuracies.

3.
Concepts: ai-driven learning pathways
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the potential of LLMs to support learning processes in the context of NetLogo.
Criteria: Participants envision or propose ways in which LLMs can support learning pathways, particularly in the context of NetLogo.
Phrase: Envision AI-driven learning support.

4.
Concepts: evaluating ai responses
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the process of assessing the relevance or usefulness of AI responses.
Criteria: Participants regularly evaluate AI responses to decide on their relevance, usefulness, or modification.
Phrase: Assess AI response relevance.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: emphasize innovative design, emphasize feature importance
Relationship: The two concepts are related in that designers emphasize innovative design by highlighting key features and their importance.
Criteria: Designers highlight innovative design elements and stress key features' significance.
Phrase: Emphasizing innovative design features.

2.
Concepts: outlining limitations, addressing limitations
Relationship: The two concepts are causally related, as outlining limitations leads to addressing them.
Criteria: Designers identify and acknowledge limitations, then provide solutions or adaptations to overcome them.
Phrase: Addressing design limitations.

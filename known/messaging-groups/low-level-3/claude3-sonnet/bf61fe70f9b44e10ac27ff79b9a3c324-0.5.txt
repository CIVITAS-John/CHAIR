You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P11: I will consider the impedance
Preliminary tags: proposing solution; planning to account for factor
2. P11: Updated to the latest version.
Preliminary tags: providing information; confirming update
3. P11: Thank you.
Preliminary tags: expressing gratitude
4. P12: My sister just discovered a county. The county chief has gone crazy and keeps sending red envelopes. 695176754, everyone hurry and grab them.
Preliminary tags: off topic message; irrelevant content
5. P5: ã€‚
Preliminary tags: minimal response; unclear meaning
6. P5: @Designer 
Preliminary tags: addressing designer; seeking attention
7. Designer: Done.
8. P5: Good ðŸ˜‚
9. P8: @Designer Get an admin
10. P13: Is everyone in this group a top student?
11. P14: Except me

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation from multiple theoretical angles, I will consider the social dynamics, community norms, and design implications. Some guiding questions are: How are participants interacting and building relationships? What norms or expectations are emerging? How is the design of the platform influencing the conversation flow and community formation?

Tags for each message:
1. proposing solution; planning; considering factors
2. providing information; confirming update; progress update
3. expressing gratitude; positive sentiment 
4. off-topic; irrelevant content; potential spam
5. minimal response; unclear meaning; ambiguous communication
6. addressing designer; seeking attention; direct interaction
7. acknowledgment; simple response
8. positive sentiment; informal tone
9. requesting action; assigning role
10. inquiring about group; seeking information
11. self-deprecating; humility  
12. agreement; affirmation; in-group identification

Summary: The conversation starts with P11 proposing a solution and updating on progress, which P5 acknowledges with minimal responses. P12 sends an off-topic, potentially spam message. P5 then directly addresses the designer, who simply acknowledges. P8 requests the designer to assign an admin role. P13 inquires about the group, and P14 self-deprecatingly states not being a top student, which P13 affirms. The conversation shows a mix of on-topic problem-solving, off-topic tangents, direct designer interactions, role negotiations, and attempts to build group identity.

Notes: Some potential community norms emerging are direct designer interactions for support, assigning roles for moderation, and attempts to establish a shared identity (e.g. top students). The off-topic message could signal a need for stronger moderation or community guidelines. The minimal responses and ambiguous communication could hinder effective collaboration. The design of the platform (e.g. @mentions, roles) seems to be influencing the conversation flow and community formation.

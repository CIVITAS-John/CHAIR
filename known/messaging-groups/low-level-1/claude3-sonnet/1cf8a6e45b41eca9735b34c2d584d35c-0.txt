17. P11: The result is not as expected.
18. P11: I'm not sure if it's a circuit issue or a software bug. Seeking advice.
19. P11: [Image]
20. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
21. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
22. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits. So I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know. So please enlighten me in the future if I don't understand. Thank you.
23. P4: Have you updated it?
24. P11: It's not ideal...
25. P11: I will consider the impedance.

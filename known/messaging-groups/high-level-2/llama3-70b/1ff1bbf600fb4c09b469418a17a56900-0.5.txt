Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1

3. P7: Oh oh
4. P2: [Image 1-20]
5. P2: [Image 1-21]
6. P7: 66
7. P7: How to connect
8. P7: Let him
9. P2: The wiring is all on top
10. P2: It's still very simple
11. P7: How to make it work
12. P7: Display the data
13. P7: That key
14. P2: [Image 1-30]
15. P2: The button with the wire will do
16. P7: Oh oh
17. P9: [Image 1-33]
18. P9: How to make it work
19. Designer: ï¼Ÿ

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab's online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation appears to revolve around a discussion about building an experiment, with participants sharing images, asking questions, and providing guidance on how to connect and make the experiment work.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do participants collaborate and share knowledge in this online community? How do they use visual aids and language to communicate complex ideas? What role does the designer play in facilitating the conversation?

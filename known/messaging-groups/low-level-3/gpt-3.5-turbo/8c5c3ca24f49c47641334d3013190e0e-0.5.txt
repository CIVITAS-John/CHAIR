You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Haha
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: After the official release of the new version, there will be more people here.
5. Designer: I guess it's because the teacher finds it annoying when people talk too much.233
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image 6]
8. P5: 233 By the way, let's see if there are any good designs to learn from.
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: Like a microcomputer.
===
Thoughts: The conversation seems to revolve around the release of a new version of something, potentially the Physics Lab platform, and the anticipation of more users joining the community. There is a mention of teachers finding excessive talking annoying, which could indicate a focus on maintaining a productive and focused discussion environment. The mention of "good designs" and a "microcomputer" could hint at discussions related to design principles or hardware configurations.

Tags for each message:
1. Expression of disapproval
2. Light-hearted response
3. Designer interaction
4. Anticipation of increased community size
5. Reflection on teacher's perspective
6. Greeting
7. Sharing an image
8. Seeking design inspiration
9. Inquiry about good design
10. Reference to microcomputers

Summary: The conversation starts with casual expressions, followed by the Designer's mention of the upcoming increase in community members post a new release. There is a reflection on teachers' perspective on excessive talking, along with a mention of seeking good design examples and a comparison to microcomputers.

Notes: The Designer seems to play a significant role in guiding the conversation and setting expectations for the community's growth. The focus on good design and potential hardware discussions could indicate an interest in improving the platform or discussing related technologies within the community.

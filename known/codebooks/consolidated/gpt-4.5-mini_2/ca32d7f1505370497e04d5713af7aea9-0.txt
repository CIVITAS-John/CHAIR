You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: interact with ai for coding, utilize ai-generated code in practice
- Users dictate parameters to the AI and manually write code while referencing AI-generated outputs.
- Users decide to copy and paste AI-generated code for execution and selectively integrate relevant AI-generated code for their needs.

2.
Concepts: clarify ai capabilities, engages with ai through questioning
- Users question and seek clarification on the capabilities and functionalities of the AI system.
- Users engage with AI by following up with specific questions for clarification.

3.
Concepts: perceive ai as a collaborative partner, envision ai as a supportive peer programmer
- Interviewees perceive AI as a supportive peer and collaborative partner in coding and learning.
- Users discuss AI's potential as a peer programmer and envision it as a supportive entity that prompts users to reflect on their coding choices.

4.
Concepts: identify ai output inconsistencies, interpret and reason through ai outputs
- Interviewees observe inconsistencies and identify bugs or inaccuracies in AI-generated outputs.
- Interviewees actively interpret and reason through AI responses to identify inaccuracies.

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. 
Concepts: interact with ai for coding, utilize ai-generated code in practice
Relationship: The concepts are interrelated as users both engage with the AI to generate code and apply that code in their own work, indicating a cycle of interaction and application.
Criteria: Users dictate parameters to the AI and manually write code while referencing AI-generated outputs, and they decide to copy and paste AI-generated code for execution and selectively integrate relevant AI-generated code for their needs.
Phrase: Utilize AI-generated code in practice.

2. 
Concepts: clarify ai capabilities, engages with ai through questioning
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as users seek to understand the AI's functionalities through questioning, which enhances their engagement with the system.
Criteria: Users question and seek clarification on the capabilities and functionalities of the AI system, and they engage with AI by following up with specific questions for clarification.
Phrase: Seek clarification on AI capabilities.

3. 
Concepts: perceive ai as a collaborative partner, envision ai as a supportive peer programmer
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both reflect users' perceptions of AI as a collaborative entity that aids in coding and learning, emphasizing the supportive role of AI.
Criteria: Interviewees perceive AI as a supportive peer and collaborative partner in coding and learning, and users discuss AI's potential as a peer programmer and envision it as a supportive entity that prompts users to reflect on their coding choices.
Phrase: View AI as a collaborative partner.

4. 
Concepts: identify ai output inconsistencies, interpret and reason through ai outputs
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as users not only identify inconsistencies in AI outputs but also engage in reasoning to understand and interpret these outputs, indicating a critical engagement with the AI.
Criteria: Interviewees observe inconsistencies and identify bugs or inaccuracies in AI-generated outputs, and they actively interpret and reason through AI responses to identify inaccuracies.
Phrase: Analyze AI output for inconsistencies.

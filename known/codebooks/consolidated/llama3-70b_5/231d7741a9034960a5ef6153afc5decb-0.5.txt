You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: suggesting a possible future development in chemistry
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

2.
Label: requesting an export function or the ability to save and import experiments
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

3.
Label: propose potential solution
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

4.
Label: confirms being a teacher
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

5.
Label: adding more specific information and criteria to the answer
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

6.
Label: encourage in-group discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

11.
Label: user inquires about download process
Quotes:
- User: How to download?

12.
Label: confirms a specific type of circuit diagram intersection based on user feedback

- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

13.
Label: give reason
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

15.
Label: uses emojis to convey feelings or reactions
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

16.
Label: explaining development challenges
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

17.
Label: expressing support
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

18.
Label: sharing a workaround for accessing the browser on a full screen application
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

19.
Label: answer to a question
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

20.
Label: compliments the software
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

21.
Label: vague on responses to the feature request
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

22.
Label: multi platform development adds complexity but seems well managed
Quotes:
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]

23.
Label: the availability of multiple platforms may be important for widespread adoption
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

24.
Label: fosters a positive and appreciative atmosphere
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

25.
Label: anticipating user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

26.
Label: planning future development
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
- Designer: There will be.

27.
Label: inquiring about updates
Quotes:
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?

Label: commits to consulting the community when initiating new features or experiments
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

30.
Label: demonstrating reflective thinking
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

31.
Label: demonstrating functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

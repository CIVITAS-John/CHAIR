1. 大家好～开发计划、PC 下载地址都在群公告里
---
2. 如果有什么建议和需求欢迎提出来
---
3. 先膜拜一下大神，再提一点小需求。能不能做机械波机械振动的动态演示，例如横波纵波的传播，波的叠加，波的衍射、干涉。还有光学的实验，很希望有光具座、单缝、双缝、偏振片啊这种，可以演示光学实验～
---
4. 嗯……我们应该会优先完成电学，然后是磁学，然后是其他部分【
---
5. 开始力学之前会再集中征求意见～不然怕自己记不住
---
6. 好的好的～辛苦辛苦了

7. [Emoji]大家好，请问PC / 交互式电子白板版本的Physics Lab在哪里可以下载到呢
---
8. 看到群文件了，谢谢

1. Hi everyone! The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
---
2. If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to speak up.

3. First, I'll worship the great gods, and then I'll make a small request. Can we have a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? And I also hope to have optical experiments, such as optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers, to demonstrate optical experiments.
---
4. Yeah... we should prioritize completing the electricity part, then the magnetism part, and then the other parts.
---
5. We'll gather opinions again before starting mechanics, or else I'm afraid I'll forget.
---
6. Okay, okay, thanks for your hard work.
---
7. [Emoji] Hi everyone, where can I download the PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

8. I've seen the group files, thanks.

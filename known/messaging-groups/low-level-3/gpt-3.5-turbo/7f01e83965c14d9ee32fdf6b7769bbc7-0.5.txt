You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. P8: [Image 0]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

Thoughts: In this conversation, we can analyze the interaction between the Designer and the community member from the perspective of user needs and interface design. We can also explore how the community's roles and dynamics shaped the emergence of Physics Lab. Additionally, we can consider the learning processes involved in using the platform, especially for educational purposes.

Tags for each message:
1. Image uploading process; User interface design; High-resolution images
2. User needs; Watermark removal; Community interaction
3. Platform version; Compatibility
4. Image uploading demonstration; User role clarification; Educational context
5. Teaching role; Community roles

Summary: The conversation starts with a community member asking the Designer about uploading high-resolution images without watermarks. The Designer inquires about the platform version and offers to demonstrate the image upload process. The community member confirms being a teacher, indicating a potential educational context for the interaction.

Notes: The conversation hints at the potential use of Physics Lab for educational purposes, with the Designer engaging with community members to address their needs and provide support. The dynamics between the Designer and users, especially teachers, could be crucial in understanding how the platform's features and usability evolved.

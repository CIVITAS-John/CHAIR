You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: analyzing the problem
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

2.
Label: testing phase
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

3.
Label: confirmation the developer's whole argument
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

4.
Label: reach a conclusion for the solution based on user's response
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

5.
Label: direct users to resources
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

6.
Label: sharing classroom experiences
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

7.
Label: user manual inquiry
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software
- User: Is there a user manual?

8.
Label: inquire about update timeline
Quotes:
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]

9.
Label: future update
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

10.
Label: communicate development process
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

11.
Label: justify request
Quotes:
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

12.
Label: usability discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

13.
Label: acknowledge finding resources
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

14.
Label: use emoji to greet
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

16.
Label: connecting to community
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

17.
Label: offer a solution
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
- User: Win7 should be fine.

18.
Label: highlight practical application

19.
Label: ask for download instructions
Quotes:
- User: How to download?

20.
Label: encouraging interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

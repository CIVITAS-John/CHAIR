You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
The draft merging plan aims to combine smaller categories into more comprehensive ones. However, some categories might still be too broad or unclear.

* The "online interactions" category might be too broad and could be split into more specific categories, such as "community building" and "online discussions".
* The "technology and learning" category might be unclear and could be renamed to "technology-enhanced learning" or split into separate categories for "technology" and "learning".
* The "social and informational needs" category might be too vague and could be split into separate categories for "social identity" and "information seeking".

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: ai constraints, recognize ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related in that recognizing AI limitations implies an understanding of the constraints of AI-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge the limitations and capacity constraints of AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Acknowledge AI limitations.

2.
Concepts: values time saving, save time with ai
Relationship: The concepts are related in that valuing time saving implies an appreciation for the benefits of using AI-driven interfaces to save time.
Criteria: Participants appreciate the time-saving benefits of using AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Value time-saving benefits.

3.
Concepts: benefit of ai - instant feedback, receive timely feedback from ai
Relationship: The concepts are related in that recognizing the benefit of instant feedback implies an appreciation for the timely feedback provided by AI-driven interfaces.
Criteria: AI-driven interfaces provide immediate and timely feedback.
Phrase: Appreciate instant feedback.

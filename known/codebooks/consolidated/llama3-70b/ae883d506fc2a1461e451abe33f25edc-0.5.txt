You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: restriction explanation, sharing anecdote about network restrictions
Relationship: Inclusion (restriction explanation includes sharing anecdote about network restrictions as a way to explain the reasons behind a specific policy or restriction)
Criteria: Participants explain or justify network restrictions by sharing personal anecdotes about their experiences with limited internet access in classrooms.
Label: Justifying Network Restrictions

2.
Concepts: touch screen constraints, touch screen accessibility
Relationship: Intersection (touch screen constraints and touch screen accessibility are related concepts that intersect in the context of usability)
Criteria: Participants discuss the limitations and accessibility issues of touch screens, highlighting the need for improvements.
Label: Touch Screen Usability Challenges

3.
Concepts: limitation acknowledgment, usability limitations
Relationship: Parallel (limitation acknowledgment and usability limitations are related but distinct concepts that run parallel to each other)
Criteria: Participants acknowledge the limitations or instability of a system or process, highlighting the need for improvement.
Label: Acknowledging System Limitations

4.
Concepts: feature suggestions
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants propose new features or ideas, or request features for optical experiments or mechanics.
Label: Feature Enhancement Suggestions

5.
Concepts: update announcement
Relationship: Inclusion (update announcement includes providing information about updates in preparation)
Criteria: Designers communicate updates, changes, or plans to users, including new features or bug fixes.
Label: Update Notifications

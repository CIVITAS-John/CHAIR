Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

* Summary
The conversation involves members of the Physics Lab online community discussing how to conduct experiments and make a device work. They are exchanging ideas, troubleshooting, and sharing images to help each other.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, I will focus on the following areas:
- Collaborative problem-solving and knowledge sharing
- Scaffolding and guidance within the community
- Engagement and participation in the design process
- Iterative experimentation and prototyping

# Collaborative Problem-Solving and Knowledge Sharing
## Exchanging Ideas and Troubleshooting
Definition: Participants engage in a back-and-forth dialogue to share their understanding, ask questions, and provide suggestions to solve a problem.
- "Why suddenly add a wave?" (P8)
- "How to make it work" (P7)
- "How to display the data" (P7)

## Sharing Visual Information
Definition: Participants use images to supplement their explanations and provide visual references to aid understanding.
- "The wiring is all on top" (P2)
- "[Image 30]" (P2)
- "[Image 33]" (P9)

# Scaffolding and Guidance within the Community
## Providing Step-by-Step Instructions
Definition: Participants offer detailed guidance and instructions to help others understand how to complete a task or use a device.
- "Just press the button with the wire" (P2)
- "Let him" (P7)

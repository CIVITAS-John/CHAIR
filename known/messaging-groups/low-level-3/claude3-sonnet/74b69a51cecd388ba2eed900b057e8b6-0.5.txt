You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P4232: Thank you.
Preliminary tags: gratitude expression
2. P8: You're welcome. If you encounter any problems during use, feel free to discuss them directly in the group.
Preliminary tags: support offer; community engagement encouragement
3. P4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to do everything and ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary tags: positive feedback; usability praise; focused design appreciation
4. Designer: I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to set up a virtual machine.
Preliminary tags: compatibility consideration; virtualization plan
5. Designer: In theory, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from around 2008 onwards).
Preliminary tags: compatibility expectation; hardware requirement
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, with the following updates:
Preliminary tags: release announcement; version update; group file sharing
7. Designer: # New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a brief process, rather than immediately. 
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface. 
Support for undoing wire connections, component creation, and deletion. 
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current. 
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key. 

# New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter. 
Added a student power supply (AC/DC ideal power supply). 

# Adjustment of Component Properties
Dry cells now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources. 
Incandescent light bulbs now have voltage-current characteristics parameters and are no longer ideal resistors. 
The resistor law experiment now uses real formulas for calculation with adjustable parameters. 
Hidden terminals 3 and 4. 

# Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue caused by unit conversion when editing properties in the editor. 
Terminal arrows no longer display jumping animations. 
There may be calculation errors in certain circuit connections.
8. P4232: It is suggested to add an exit button function for the PC version, as many regions now use all-in-one touch screen computers without physical keyboards.
9. Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, and there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. P8: In that case, shouldn't a virtual keyboard be added to every input field?
11. Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input field, probably like that.
13. Designer: I tried it in junior high last time. Now there is a clever way to click on the link button in the upper right corner, pop up the browser, and it won't be full screen anymore... = =
14. P4232: @Designer Yes, that's right.
15. P4232: It would be convenient to have an export function, or save and import experiments. We can set the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer: It will be available.
17. Designer: Is there a network in the classroom?
18. P4232: Generally not, since one time during a city-level public class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 41].

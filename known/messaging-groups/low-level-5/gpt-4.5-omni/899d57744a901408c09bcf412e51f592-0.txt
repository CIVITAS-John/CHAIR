You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 announces update; designer 1 explains changes to components; designer 1 provides simulation tips; designer 1 informs about internal resistance removal
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 describes student power supply; designer 1 highlights component features; designer 1 informs about dc and ac support; designer 1 labels component as ideal
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 requests feedback; designer 1 encourages community suggestions; designer 1 fosters participatory design; designer 1 seeks user input
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 inquires about pc version usage; user 4232 seeks technical support; user 4232 engages with community for help
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary phrases: designer 2 informs about system compatibility; designer 2 provides technical support; designer 2 addresses user query; designer 2 clarifies limitations
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

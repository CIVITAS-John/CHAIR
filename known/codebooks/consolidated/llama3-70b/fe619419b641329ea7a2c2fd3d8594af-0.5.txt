You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: detailed overview of update
Quotes:
- # New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a brief process, rather than immediately. 
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface. 
Support for undoing wire connections, component creation, and deletion. 
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current. 
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key. 

# New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter. 
Added a student power supply (AC/DC ideal power supply). 

# Adjustment of Component Properties
Dry cells now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources. 
Incandescent light bulbs now have voltage-current characteristics parameters and are no longer ideal resistors. 
The resistor law experiment now uses real formulas for calculation with adjustable parameters. 
Hidden terminals 3 and 4. 

# Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue caused by unit conversion when editing properties in the editor. 
Terminal arrows no longer display jumping animations. 
There may be calculation errors in certain circuit connections.

- Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, and there will probably be another round this weekend.

4.
Label: clarification
Quotes:
- But you can't bring it up without touching the input field, probably like that.
- In that case, shouldn't a virtual keyboard be added to every input field?
- Um... left or right?

5.

8.
Label: confirmation
Quotes:
- @John Chen (3) Yes, that's right.

9.
Label: design/feature suggestion
Quotes:

Label: encouraging elaboration
Quotes:
- Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?

19.
Label: design suggestion
Quotes:
- This is great, hoping it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams. Also, it would be great to have a function to hide the background grid with one click, making it easier for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no convenient software for drawing circuit diagrams for circuit-related questions.

Label: current efforts
Quotes:
- Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

22.
Label: future update
Quotes:
- Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics is figured out; it will take some time
- Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later

23.
Label: suggestion
Quotes:
- This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, and may produce some weird results.
- You can also include mechanics experiments

24.
Label: elaboration of suggestion
Quotes:
- For example, after connecting the physical diagram, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram, or vice versa

25.
Label: user satisifcation
Quotes:

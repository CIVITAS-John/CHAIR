You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: facilitate user confidence
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.
- Designer: 7 is okay.

2.
Label: accpeting the suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

3.
Label: outline project timelines
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

4.
Label: elaborate on user interface challenges
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

5.
Label: enhance design process
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

6.
Label: foster collaborative decision making
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?
- User: Left side

7.
Label: user 4234 acknowledges standard
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

8.
Label: clarify software capabilities
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

9.
Label: user 4232 praises software
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

10.
Label: request
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

11.
Label: express enthusiasm
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

12.
Label: communicate project priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

13.
Label: enhance credibility of the product
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

14.
Label: express frustration with outdated technology
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

15.
Label: respond to initial question
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

16.
Label: maintain transparency about release plans
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

17.
Label: designer 1 confirms update
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

18.
Label: provide technical insight
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

19.
Label: ensure comprehensive input before proceeding
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

20.
Label: ethusiasm
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- User: This idea is really good

21.
Label: suggest user autonomy
Quotes:
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

22.
Label: alleviate user concerns about delays
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

23.
Label: seek enhancements for learning experiences
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

24.
Label: provided constructive feedback
Quotes:

- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

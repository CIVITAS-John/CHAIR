You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
4. {Repeat the input 4}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 4}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 4}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 4}

Definitions for each code:

1. attention to detail, craftsmanship
Relationship: Inclusive (craftsmanship implies attention to detail)
Criteria: Emphasizes the importance of precision, quality, or perfection in design or development.
Label: Quality Orientation

2. feature complexity, development challenges
Relationship: Parallel (feature complexity and development challenges are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Describes difficulties, obstacles, or complexities in design or development.
Label: Development Challenges

3. user support
Relationship: Inclusive (offering guidance implies offering support)
Criteria: Involves providing or requesting help, assistance, or guidance from one user to another.
Label: Peer Support

4. development plan
Relationship: Inclusive (outlining plans implies sharing timelines or roadmaps)
Criteria: Involves sharing or discussing plans, timelines, or roadmaps for development or future plans.
Label: Development Planning

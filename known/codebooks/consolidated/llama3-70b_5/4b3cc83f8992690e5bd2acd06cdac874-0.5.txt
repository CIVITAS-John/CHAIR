You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: inform designers about user environment
Quotes:
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

2.
Label: emphasize detail oriented development
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

3.
Label: designer 1 clarifies version information
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

4.
Label: design suggestion
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

5.
Label: communication about progress and plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

6.
Label: outline new features
Quotes:
- Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features

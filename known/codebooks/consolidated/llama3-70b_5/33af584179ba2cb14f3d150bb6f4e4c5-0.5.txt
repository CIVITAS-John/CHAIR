You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: appreciating design
Quotes:
- User: Oh, this is nice

2.
Label: specifies details like zero adjustment for enhanced user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

3.
Label: expressing intent to simplify the design
Quotes:
- Designer: Make it simpler...

4.
Label: tempering expectations
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

5.
Label: highlights software limitations
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

6.
Label: express interest in platform development
Quotes:
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

7.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: communicating development strategy
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

2.
Label: user 4233 asks about download process
Quotes:
- User: How to download?

3.
Label: actively involving users in the process
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

4.
Label: expressing positive sentiment about the new features
Quotes:
- User: Oh, this is nice

5.
Label: expanding on suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

6.
Label: teaching
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

7.
Label: highlight progress
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

8.
Label: ask a question
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
- User: Is there a user manual?
- User: How to download?

9.
Label: encouraging designers
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

10.
Label: exploring solutions
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

11.
Label: outlining feature development
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

12.
Label: seeks clarification on the preferred side for circuit diagram intersections
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- User: Left side

13.
Label: especially for all in one touch screen machines without physical keyboards
Quotes:

Label: demonstrating responsiveness to feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

15.
Label: suggesting feature improvements
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

16.
Label: acknowledging manual editing
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

17.
Label: considering future expansions
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

18.
Label: expressing needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

19.
Label: inquiring about timeline
Quotes:
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]

20.

21.
Label: acknowledging community expertise
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- Designer: We are working on this part

22.
Label: discuss usability
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

23.
Label: apologizing for inconvenience
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

24.
Label: emphasizing simplicity
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

25.
Label: promise to development an app about chemistry on a later time
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

26.
Label: the conversation indicates an iterative development process influenced by user feedback and educational needs
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

27.
Label: seeking confirmation or correction
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

28.
Label: enabling group work
Quotes:

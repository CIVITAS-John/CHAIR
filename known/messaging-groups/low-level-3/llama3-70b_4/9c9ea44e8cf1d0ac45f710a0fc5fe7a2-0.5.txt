You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary tags: feature explanation; technical details; educational application
2. P4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary tags: user feedback; feature suggestion; design principles
3. Designer: Hmm.
Preliminary tags: communication tone; social norms; designer's response
4. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. P4232: Indeed
6. Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. P4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

12. Designer: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. P4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

Thoughts: For this conversation, I will focus on identifying the themes related to the design and development of Physics Lab, the role of the designer, and the interactions between the designer and users. I will also explore how the conversation reveals the emergent nature of the online community. Guiding questions include: How does the designer respond to user feedback? What are the design principles guiding the development of Physics Lab? How do the users influence the design process?

Tags for each message:
1. feature explanation; technical details; educational application; circuit diagram
2. user feedback; feature suggestion; design principles; categorization
3. communication tone; social norms; designer's response; acknowledgement
4. subject domain; physics education; educational constraints; future plans
5. agreement; acknowledgement
6. personal interest; chemistry; designer's perspective
7. future plans; opportunity; experimentation
8. feature development; experimental details; simulation; assessment
9. positive feedback; idea evaluation
10. community engagement; consultation; collaboration
11. teacher consultation; textbook analysis; circuit diagrams
12. image sharing; circuit diagrams; confirmation
13. agreement; common practice; textbook convention

Summary: The conversation revolves around the design and development of Physics Lab, with the designer explaining features and technical details, responding to user feedback, and discussing future plans. The designer shares their personal interests and perspectives, while also engaging with users and teachers to inform the design process.

Notes: The designer's tone is informative and collaborative, with a focus on educational applications. The users provide feedback and suggestions, which the designer acknowledges and responds to. The conversation reveals an emergent online community, where the designer and users collaborate to shape the development of Physics Lab.

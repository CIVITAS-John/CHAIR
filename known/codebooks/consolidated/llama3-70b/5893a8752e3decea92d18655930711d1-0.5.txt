You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: emphasizing ease of use
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

7.
Label: suggesting usability improvements
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

Label: outlining timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

9.
Label: explaining design decisions
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

10.
Label: weighing trade offs
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

11.
Label: identifying potential issues
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

16.
Label: setting realistic timeline
Quotes:

17.
Label: sharing research goals
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

18.
Label: updating users on platform developments
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

19.
Label: responding to feature requests
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

20.
Label: validating designer's experience

- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.
- User: Indeed

21.
Label: demonstrating domain expertise
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

22.
Label: highlighting potential use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

23.
Label: explaining school's internet policy
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

24.
Label: demonstrating commitment
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

25.
Label: prioritizing development roadmap
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

26.
Label: suggesting alternative operating system
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

27.
Label: planning community engagement
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

29.
Label: exploring educational standards
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

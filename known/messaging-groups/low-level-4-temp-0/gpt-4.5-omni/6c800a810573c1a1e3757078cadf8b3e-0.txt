You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: describe planned feature; align with educational use case; enhance functionality
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: express approval; show support
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: mention future consultation; encourage participatory design
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Preliminary phrases: solicit feedback; engage community; align with educational standards
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: provide visual reference; seek confirmation; engage community
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirm common practice; provide feedback; align with educational standards
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation revolves around the development and refinement of a simulated experiment assessment feature for electricity in the Physics Lab. Designer-1 outlines the planned feature and seeks feedback from the community, particularly focusing on the type of circuit diagram intersections used in textbooks. User-4234 confirms the common practice and provides specific feedback, leading to a discussion on the best approach to use. Designer-1 updates the community on the progress and acknowledges the support, while User-4234 inquires about the update schedule. Designer-1 provides a detailed timeline for the upcoming updates and sets expectations for the scope of the update.

Notes: The conversation highlights the participatory design approach taken by the designers, actively seeking and incorporating feedback from the community. The focus on aligning with educational standards and usability concerns is evident. The interaction between Designer-1 and User-4234 demonstrates a collaborative effort to refine the feature, with both parties contributing to the decision-making process. The anticipation for updates indicates an engaged and invested user community.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: system compatibility, discussing compatibility
- Users or designers discuss or confirm compatibility of software with specific operating systems.
- Designer theorizes or explains software compatibility issues, or clarifies compatibility issues with different systems or devices, or considers or explains compatibility issues with specific operating systems.

2.
Concepts: software usability feedback, participating in community discussion
- Users express opinions or experiences about the usability of the software.
- A user participates in a discussion about the software or its development.

3.
Concepts: context sharing, providing context
- User shares context or background information about their situation.
- User or designer provides context or background information about the online platform or a specific topic.

4.
Concepts: user-centered design, user-centered design emphasis
- Designer explores user needs, discusses user experiences, and considers user interface design elements.
- Emphasizing the importance of user experience or user-centered design

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: system compatibility, discussing compatibility
Relationship: Inclusion (discussing compatibility is a way to address system compatibility)
Criteria: Users or designers discuss or confirm the compatibility of software with specific operating systems, or designers explain or clarify compatibility issues.
Label: Addressing System Compatibility

2.
Concepts: software usability feedback, participating in community discussion
Relationship: Intersection (participating in community discussion leads to sharing software usability feedback)
Criteria: Users express opinions or experiences about software usability while engaging in online community discussions.
Label: Sharing Software Usability Insights

3.
Concepts: context sharing, providing context
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts refer to sharing information, but about different topics)
Criteria: Users or designers share background information about their situation, the online platform, or a specific topic.
Label: Providing Contextual Information

4.
Concepts: user-centered design, user-centered design emphasis
Relationship: Inclusion (emphasizing user-centered design is a way to prioritize user-centered design)
Criteria: Designers prioritize user needs, experiences, and interface design elements, or stress the importance of user-centered design.
Label: Prioritizing User-Centered Design

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- The draft merging plan covers most of the categories well, with a few exceptions:
  - "Technical Aspects" could potentially be split into more specific categories like "Software Design", "Hardware Integration", and "Technical Support".
  - "Scientific Content and Tools" could be further divided into "Scientific Content", "Scientific Tools", and "Design-Based Learning".
  - "Community Engagement and Learning" is a very broad category that could be split into more specific aspects like "Community Engagement", "Knowledge Sharing", "Learning Processes", and "Communication Patterns".
- The naming of the categories is generally accurate and concise, but some could be improved:
  - "Technical Aspects" could be renamed to "Technical Infrastructure" to better reflect the merged categories.
  - "Scientific Content and Tools" could be renamed to "Scientific Resources and Tools" to better capture the range of content and tools.
  - "Community Engagement and Learning" could be split into multiple categories with more specific names, such as "Community Engagement", "Knowledge Exchange", "Learning Experiences", and "Communication Dynamics".

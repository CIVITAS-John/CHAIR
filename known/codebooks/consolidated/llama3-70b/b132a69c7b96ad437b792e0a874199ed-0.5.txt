You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not write repetitive ones.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: tacit disagreement
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

2.
Label: discussion of further interests
Quotes:
- I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
- I am also a bit interested in chemistry

3.
Label: future design plans
Quotes:
- For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)

4.
Label: concurring on design ideas
Quotes:
- This is a really good idea

5.
Label: asking for future help
Quotes:
- When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group

6.
Label: ask for teachers' help
Quotes:
- I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

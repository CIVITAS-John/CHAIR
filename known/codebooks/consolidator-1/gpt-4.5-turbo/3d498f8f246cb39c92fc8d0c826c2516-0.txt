You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- **More categories for merging:** The categories "community engagement and roles" and "community structure and culture" could potentially be merged into a single category, but this might create an overly broad category. 
- **Over-merged categories:** The "design processes and strategies" category might be too broad, as it combines strategic, advisory, and process insights which could have distinct impacts on the community's emergence.
- **Naming inaccuracies:** The name "digital and technical communication" might be too broad and not clearly distinguish the nuances between digital communication tools and technical content discussions.

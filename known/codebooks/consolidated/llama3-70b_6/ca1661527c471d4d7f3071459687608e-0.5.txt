You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the need for systems to support learning in short, fragmented time blocks, with the latter concept providing more context to the former.
Criteria: Individuals describe and highlight the need for systems to support learning in short, fragmented time blocks.
Phrase: Identifying fragmented learning needs.

2.
Concepts: express frustration with limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the emotional response of frustration due to limitations in the AI interface.
Criteria: Users express frustration due to limitations in the AI interface, including troubleshooting options and feedback.
Phrase: Expressing frustration with AI limitations.

3.
Concepts: seeking ai assistance
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the act of seeking help from AI to achieve goals or resolve issues.
Criteria: Participants seek assistance from AI to achieve their goals and resolve issues, including asking questions and seeking NetLogo syntax help.
Phrase: Seeking AI support.

4.
Concepts: identifying ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the process of recognizing and acknowledging the limitations of AI.

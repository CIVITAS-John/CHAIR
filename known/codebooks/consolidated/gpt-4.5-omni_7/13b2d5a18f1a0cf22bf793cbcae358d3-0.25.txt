You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: evaluating ai search results, assessing ai's model search accuracy
- Users evaluate the search results provided by AI and assess the quality and usefulness of AI-generated responses.
- Users evaluate AI's ability to find models in the library and assess its search accuracy.

2.
Concepts: refining ai query approach, refining ai interaction terms
- Users deliberate on the phrasing of queries and refine their approach when querying the AI for debugging.
- Users consider the optimal terms to use when inputting requests to AI, dictating parameter fields and engaging in dialogue to ensure clarity and accurate responses.

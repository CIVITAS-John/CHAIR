Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. P14: Except me.
2. P13: ＋1
3. P15: Plus one
4. P16: ＋1
5. P10: What does "+1" mean?
6. P11: It means "me too".
7. P13: +1 means the same opinion
8. P13: emmmm
9. P13: You can search on Baidu

* Summary
This conversation appears to be a discussion among multiple participants (P10, P11, P13, P14, P15, P16) in an online group or forum. P14 starts by saying "Except me," which suggests they are responding to a previous statement or question. P13, P15, and P16 then respond with "+1," which P11 and P13 explain means "me too" or expressing agreement with the same opinion. P10 asks for clarification on what "+1" means, and P13 suggests searching on Baidu (a Chinese search engine) for more information.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can consider the following:

1. Learning sciences: How does this interaction facilitate or hinder learning within the online community? What role do shared norms and language (e.g., "+1") play in knowledge construction and negotiation?

2. Human-computer interaction: How does the online platform or interface shape the way participants communicate and interact? Are there affordances or constraints that influence the use of shorthand expressions like "+1"?

3. Participatory design: To what extent do participants co-construct the norms and practices of the online community? How might the design of the platform support or limit participatory processes?

# Social Norms and Shared Language
## Shared Shorthand Expressions
Definition: The use of shorthand expressions or abbreviations that are understood within the community, reflecting shared norms and language.
- P13: ＋1
- P15: Plus one
- P16: ＋1

## Negotiating Shared Meaning
Definition: Instances where participants negotiate or clarify the meaning of shared expressions or norms within the community.
- P10: What does "+1" mean?
- P11: It means "me too".
- P13: +1 means the same opinion

# Community Participation and Knowledge Sharing
## Seeking Information
Definition: Instances where participants seek information or clarification from others in the community.
- P10: What does "+1" mean?

## Sharing Knowledge
Definition: Instances where participants share knowledge or information with others in the community.
- P11: It means "me too".
- P13: +1 means the same opinion
- P13: emmmm
- P13: You can search on Baidu

# Platform Affordances and Constraints
## Technological Mediation
Definition: Instances where the technological platform or interface shapes or mediates the communication and interaction.
- (No specific examples in this conversation, but the use of "+1" could be influenced by the platform's affordances or constraints)

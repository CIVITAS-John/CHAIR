You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
Keywords: diagrams, diagram, circuit, draw, layout

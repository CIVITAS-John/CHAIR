You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (19 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...

19. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: introducing new feature; explaining simulated experiment assessment; highlighting experimental details
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: expressing enthusiasm; appreciating innovative idea
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: promising collaboration; involving users in decision making process
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: consulting users; seeking input on circuit diagrams; sharing textbook examples
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: seeking confirmation; clarifying understanding of circuit diagrams
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirming common practice; acknowledging traditional style of circuit diagrams
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

4. Designer-1: Consulting users; seeking input on circuit diagrams; sharing textbook examples
5. Designer-1: Seeking confirmation; clarifying understanding of circuit diagrams
6. User-4234: Confirming common practice; acknowledging traditional style of circuit diagrams
7. Designer-1: Seeking clarification on circuit diagram orientation
8. Designer-1: Indicating work in progress
9. User-4234: Providing clarification on circuit diagram orientation
10. Designer-1: Acknowledging user input
11. Designer-1: Seeking simplicity in design
12. User-4234: Providing design feedback; suggesting right-side orientation for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: Considering multiple design options
14. Designer-1: Explaining circuit diagram functionality; warning about unstable auto-layout algorithm
15. Designer-1: Sharing visual representation of circuit diagram
16. Designer-1: Expressing gratitude; promising improvement
17. User-4234: Inquiring about update schedule
18. Designer-1: Providing update schedule; explaining release plans
19. Designer-1: Highlighting significance of upcoming update

Summary: The conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab's online community, with designers and users collaborating on the design of simulated experiment assessment features. The designers involve users in the decision-making process, seeking input on circuit diagrams and design options. The users provide feedback and suggestions, which the designers acknowledge and consider. The conversation also touches on the update schedule and the significance of the upcoming release.

Notes: The designers seem to prioritize user involvement and feedback, which may indicate a participatory design approach. The conversation highlights the importance of collaboration and communication in shaping the online community. The designers' openness to user input and their willingness to explain design decisions suggest a commitment to transparency and user-centered design.

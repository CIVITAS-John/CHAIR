You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: propose another feature, suggest practical use case, suggesting collaboration
- A user proposes additional features for convenience.
- A user suggests practical use cases or features that would be beneficial.
- A user suggests collaboration on new features or improvements.

2.
Concepts: plan for feedback, implement feedback loop
- Planning for iterative feedback from users.
- Processes where user feedback is solicited, considered, and implemented.

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: propose another feature, suggest practical use case, suggesting collaboration
Relationship: All concepts involve users contributing ideas for improvement.
Criteria: Users propose additional features, suggest practical use cases, or recommend collaboration on new features or improvements.
Phrase: Contributing improvement ideas

2.
Concepts: plan for feedback, implement feedback loop
Relationship: Both concepts involve the systematic collection and use of user feedback.
Criteria: Planning and implementing processes to solicit, consider, and act on user feedback.
Phrase: Establishing feedback mechanisms

3.
Concepts: align with user needs, align with user feedback
Relationship: Both concepts involve aligning development efforts with user input.
Criteria: Designers align feature development with user needs and feedback to simplify processes.
Phrase: Aligning with user input

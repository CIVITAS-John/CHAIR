You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
Preliminary tags: sharing personal educational stage; discussing age context
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
Preliminary tags: discussing component usage; proposing technical discussion
3. P2: @Designer 
Preliminary tags: engaging with designer; suggesting technical discussion
4. P17: [Image 198]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
Preliminary tags: discussing chemical usage; sharing lab experience
6. P2: +1
Preliminary tags: expressing agreement; supporting previous message
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken.
8. P14: [Image 202]
9. P14: What do you mean?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top. 233333
11. P14: The condensed liquid won't flow back, right?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh, I see.
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year.
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be about electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay.
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
32. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
33. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
34. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
35. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
36. P11: Hey, good idea.
37. P2: Hehe.
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
39. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
40. Designer: The question is,
41. Designer: Where does the light come from?
42. P11: What about light?
43. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
44. P2: Touch it with your hand.
45. P14: I think there's no problem.
46. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
47. P2: And a small light.
48. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 245]
52. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
53. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
54. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
55. P1: Let's put up some ads.
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
58. Designer: Oh.
59. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).
60. P11: 23333
61. P11: I was just about to say.
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
63. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
64. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?

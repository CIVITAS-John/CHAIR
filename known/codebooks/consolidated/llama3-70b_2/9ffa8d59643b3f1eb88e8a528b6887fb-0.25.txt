You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: inquiring about user needs, seek context for clarification
- Designers ask about users' needs or backgrounds to understand their requirements.
- Designers ask for context or clarification about users' situations or questions to better understand their needs.

2.
Concepts: discuss features, comparing feature complexities
- A designer discusses a feature or its implementation, including design decisions, or discusses the flexibility of a feature.
- Designers compare or explain the complexity of different features.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: inquiring about user needs, seek context for clarification
Relationship: The two concepts are logically related as designers seek context to clarify user needs, which is a precursor to understanding user requirements.
Criteria: Designers ask about users' needs and seek context to clarify their requirements.
Phrase: Seeking user context for clarification.

2.
Concepts: discuss features, comparing feature complexities
Relationship: The two concepts are logically related as discussing features involves explaining their complexities, and comparing complexities is a way to discuss features.
Criteria: Designers discuss features and compare their complexities to explain design decisions.
Phrase: Discussing feature complexities.

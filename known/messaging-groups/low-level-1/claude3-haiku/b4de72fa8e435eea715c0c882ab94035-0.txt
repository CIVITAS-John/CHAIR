1. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, and may produce some weird results.
2. Designer: [Image]
3. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
4. P4234: Will there be updates this week? [Emoji]
5. Designer: There will be updates. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version over the weekend.
6. Designer: The update is quite substantial...
7. P4236: [Emoji]

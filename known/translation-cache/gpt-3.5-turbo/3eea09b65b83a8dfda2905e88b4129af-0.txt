1. 大家好
---
2. 您好：）
---
3. 最近还有其它更新吗？
---
4. [Image]正在准备的更新
---
5. 这个比较复杂，所以要多费点时间……希望这周来得及发布
---
6. 还会有的：万用表；通电螺线管；半导体电容器；支持转换为理想电表（比较方便解题和初中教学）
---
7. 有使用说明书吗
---
8. 您用的过程中遇到什么问题了？
---
9. 我们尽可能设计成不需要额外说明就能用，或者根据反馈会在第一次打开的时候做一些提示
---
10. 主要是学校在建设信息化学校
---
11. 需要这个软件的使用说明
---
12. 哦哦哦，您小窗吧，说一下您大概需要什么
---
13. 这个好，希望可以非常方便的画电路图，另外希望可以有个可以一键隐藏背景方格的功能，方便咱当老师的截图出试卷，现在出电路部分的题目没有一个方便画电路图的软件
---
14. 其实我们在研究的是实物图和电路图的双向转换
---
15. 当然，也会允许手工Editor，但可能稍微晚一点
---
16. 可以把力学实验也弄进去
---
17. 比如你可以连好实物图以后看到对应的电路图，或反之
---
18. 力学要等电磁都搞清楚；还要一段时间
---
19. 哦，这个不错
---
20. 希望年底之前能搞清楚电磁的
---
21. 你们这个软件立体效果很不错
---
22. 双向转换有了，可以直接在应用里做题
---
23. 已经做的有点样子了[Emoji]
---
24. 比如看到电路图去连接实物图，或反之
---
25. 不要求全，应该逐个分类、求精
---
26. 物理主要就做电学和力学；其他方向在高中以前没什么自由实验的空间，以后根据大家的需要可能做一些演示实验，但不会像电学这么开放
---
27. 我自己对化学也有点兴趣
---
28. 后续看看机会合适也搞一个
---
29. 电学这边，打算做一个模拟实验考核的功能；会增加很多实验细节，比如调零（当然只在特定模式下有用，不然平时用起来就麻烦了）
---
30. 这个想法真不错
---
31. 准备做的时候会在群里请教大家
---
32. 请教一下群里的老师：现在教材电路图上的交叉点是用哪一种？

1. Hello everyone
---
2. Hello :)
---
3. Are there any other updates recently?
---
4. [Image] Preparing for an update
---
5. This one is more complicated, so it will take a bit more time... Hopefully it will be ready for release this week
---
6. There will be: multimeter; energized solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem solving and middle school teaching)
---
7. Is there a user manual?
---
8. Have you encountered any problems while using it?
---
9. We try to design it to be usable without the need for additional instructions, or we will provide some tips when you open it for the first time based on feedback
---
10. Mainly for schools to build information technology schools
---
11. Need the user manual for this software
---
12. Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?
---
13. That's great, I hope it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no software that is convenient for drawing circuit diagrams for the circuit part of the exam
---
14. Actually, we are researching bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
---
15. Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later
---
16. You can also include mechanics experiments
---
17. For example, after connecting the physical diagram, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram, or vice versa
---
18. Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics are sorted out; it will take some time
---
19. Oh, that's good
---
20. I hope to figure out electromagnetics before the end of the year
---
21. The 3D effect of your software is very good
---
22. With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do exercises in the application
---
23. It's starting to take shape [Emoji]
---
24. For example, connecting the physical diagram to see the circuit diagram, or vice versa
---
25. Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
---
26. Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, based on everyone's needs, we may do some demonstration experiments, but it won't be as open as electricity
---
27. I am also a bit interested in chemistry
---
28. If the opportunity arises later, I will consider making one for chemistry as well
---
29. For the electrical side, I plan to add a simulated experiment assessment function; it will include many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, it will only be useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use regularly)
---
30. This is a really good idea
---
31. When preparing to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
---
32. Asking the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in textbooks? [Image]

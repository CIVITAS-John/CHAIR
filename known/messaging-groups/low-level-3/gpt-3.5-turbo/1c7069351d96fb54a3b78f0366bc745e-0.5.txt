You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation covers a range of topics including software updates, user manual requests, feature suggestions, and future development plans. The community is actively engaged in providing feedback and making feature requests, which the Designer is considering for implementation in the software.
1. Designer: For example, connecting the circuit diagram to see the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary tags: practical application of bidirectional conversion
2. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary tags: feature refinement suggestion
3. Designer: Hmm.
Preliminary tags: acknowledgment
4. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. P4232: Indeed
6. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
7. Designer: I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
8. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
9. P4232: This is a really good idea
10. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?
[Image 91]
12. Designer: [Image 92]This one.
13. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.

Thoughts: In this conversation, there is a mix of discussions around software development, future plans, and user engagement. The Designer is actively engaging with the community, seeking feedback, and considering implementing suggestions. It's essential to capture the various aspects of the conversation, including feature suggestions, future plans, acknowledgment of feedback, and potential collaborations with teachers.

Tags for each message:
1. bidirectional conversion; circuit diagram integration; practical application
2. feature refinement suggestion; categorized feedback
3. acknowledgment; response
4. physics education focus; future development plans; demonstration experiments
5. agreement
6. interest in chemistry
7. future software development plans
8. simulated experimental assessment; detailed experiments; specific modes
9. positive feedback; appreciation
10. community consultation; collaborative decision-making
11. user feedback request; community engagement; consultation with teachers
12. visual aid reference
13. circuit diagram conventions; intersection types

Summary: The conversation continues to revolve around software development, user feedback, and future plans for Physics Lab's online community. The Designer is actively engaging with users, considering implementing new features, seeking feedback on specific design elements, and exploring potential collaborations with teachers for educational content. The community members are providing suggestions, expressing interest in different subjects like chemistry, and showing appreciation for the Designer's ideas.

Notes: The Designer's approach to community engagement and collaboration seems to be effective in gathering valuable feedback and ideas for the platform's development. The focus on educational content and practical applications aligns well with the community's interests. Exploring more about how the community envisions the platform's growth and the role of educators in shaping its content could provide further insights into the emergence of Physics Lab's online community.

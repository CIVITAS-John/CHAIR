You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
4. Designer-1: There will be.
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

* Summary
The conversation discusses the development and features of the Physics Lab software, particularly in the context of its use in middle and high school classrooms. The discussion covers topics such as workarounds for full-screen mode, the need for export and import functions, the challenges of internet access in classrooms, and the positive feedback from teachers on the simulation effects of the software.

* Plan
The analysis of this conversation will focus on the following theoretical angles:

Learning Sciences: Examine the discussion around the software's simulation effects and how they engage students in the learning process. Explore the potential for features like export and import to support teachers in designing and customizing learning activities.

Human-Computer Interaction: Analyze the discussion around the workarounds for full-screen mode and the implications for the software's usability and user experience. Consider how the designers can improve the software's interface and functionality to better meet the needs of teachers and students.

Participatory Design: Investigate the interaction between the designer and the teacher, and how their collaboration and feedback can inform the development of the software to better align with the needs of the target user group.

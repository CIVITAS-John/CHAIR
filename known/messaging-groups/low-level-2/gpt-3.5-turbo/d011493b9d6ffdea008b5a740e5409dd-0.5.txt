You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
3. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. P4231: [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
6. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
7. Designer: [Image]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.

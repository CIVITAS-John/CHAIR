You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: explaning technical artifacts
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

2.
Label: gives an answer

- Designer: Group sharing.

3.
Label: asking for update
Quotes:
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

4.
Label: upload image
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

5.
Label: concurring on design ideas
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

6.
Label: raise a concern for the new feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

7.
Label: greeting back
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

8.
Label: context
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

9.
Label: give rationale to development decision
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

10.
Label: access
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

11.
Label: ask followup question on usage scenario
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

12.
Label: platform question
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
- User: Are there any other updates recently?
- User: How do you use the PC version?

13.
Label: interesting thought: use of special characters "~"
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

14.
Label: comparison to similar apps
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

15.
Label: clarification question
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

16.
Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

17.
Label: propose another feature
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

18.
Label: asking follow-up questions on needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

19.
Label: vague on responses to the feature request
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

20.
Label: communication about progress and plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

21.
Label: inquiring user input for future iterations
Quotes:
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

22.
Label: answer about compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.
- User: How do you use the PC version?
- User: Win7 should be fine.
- Designer: 7 is okay.

23.
Label: frustration
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

24.
Label: current efforts
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

25.
Label: encouraging elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

26.
Label: promise that the update is ongoing
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

28.
Label: promising it will realize
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

29.
Label: adding more specific information and criteria to the answer
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

30.
Label: listing what might need to be done
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

31.
Label: difficulty in development
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

32.
Label: feature discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (18 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
18. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: Thank you.
Preliminary phrases: thank you; expressing gratitude; acknowledging support
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary phrases: no need to be polite; if you encounter any problems during use; you can directly mention them in the group; encouraging open feedback; promoting community support; setting tone for collaborative problem solving
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary phrases: this software is great! it's quite practical; unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use; evaluating software usability; contrasting with other software
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary phrases: xp compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine; identifying potential technical issues; proposing solutions
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary phrases: theoretically; it should be compatible; explaining technical limitations; setting boundaries
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary phrases: hello everyone~ version 1.01 has been released in the group files; the updates are as follows:; announcing updates; sharing resources
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

Thoughts: 
In this first round of coding, I plan to focus on understanding the interactions between the designers and users, identifying the tone and language used, and recognizing the themes that emerge from the conversation. I will analyze the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to gain insights into how the Physics Lab's online community emerged. Guiding questions include: What are the designers' and users' roles in shaping the community? How do they communicate and collaborate? What are the technical and social challenges they face, and how do they address them?

Interpretations for each message:
1. expressing gratitude; acknowledging support
2. encouraging open feedback; promoting community support; setting tone for collaborative problem solving
3. evaluating software usability; contrasting with other software; expressing satisfaction
4. identifying potential technical issues; proposing solutions; anticipating future development
5. explaining technical limitations; setting boundaries; clarifying expectations
6. announcing updates; sharing resources; facilitating community engagement
7. listing new features; highlighting improvements; showcasing development progress
8. suggesting new features; highlighting regional differences; emphasizing user needs
9. acknowledging user feedback; promising future updates; committing to iterative development
10. proposing additional features; considering user interface design; thinking aloud
11. explaining technical capabilities; clarifying design decisions; educating users
12. acknowledging design limitations; recognizing user needs; empathizing with users
13. sharing personal experience; illustrating technical workarounds; showing humility
14. expressing agreement; showing enthusiasm; building rapport
15. suggesting new features; emphasizing convenience; highlighting teacher needs
16. promising future development; acknowledging user requests; building trust
17. inquiring about technical infrastructure; understanding user context; planning for future development
18. sharing institutional constraints; explaining technical limitations; highlighting challenges in educational settings

Summary: 
The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab software, with users providing feedback and suggestions, and designers responding with explanations, justifications, and promises for future development. The tone is collaborative, with designers encouraging open feedback and users expressing gratitude and satisfaction. The conversation touches on technical issues, user interface design, and regional differences, highlighting the complexities of developing software for educational settings.

Notes: 
The designers seem to be open to user feedback and willing to iterate on their design. The users are enthusiastic about the software and provide constructive suggestions. The conversation suggests that the community is emerging around the Physics Lab software, with designers and users working together to shape its development. The technical and social challenges faced by the community, such as XP compatibility and internet access in classrooms, will likely continue to influence the development of the software.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: selectively using ai-generated code, interpreting and executing ai-generated code
- Participants use AI-generated code selectively, and selectively copy AI-generated code into the model, evaluating its usefulness.
- Participants evaluate and interpret AI-generated code, making decisions about how to proceed, and choose to execute AI-generated code.

2.
Concepts: comparing ai to human interns, comparing ai tools and resources
- Participants compare AI to human interns and assistance.
- Participants compare AI tools and resources.

3.
Concepts: interacts with ai naturally, treating ai as a natural interaction partner
- Demonstrates user interaction with AI tool, personifying AI-driven interfaces.
- Participants treat AI as a natural interaction partner, suggesting human-like AI communication for improved interaction, and adapt communication styles.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: selectively using ai-generated code, interpreting and executing ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are closely related as participants first interpret and evaluate AI-generated code, and then decide whether to use it selectively.
Criteria: Participants evaluate and execute AI-generated code in a selective manner.
Phrase: Evaluating and executing AI-generated code selectively.

2.
Concepts: comparing ai to human interns, comparing ai tools and resources
Relationship: The concepts are related as participants compare AI to human interns and also evaluate AI tools and resources.
Criteria: Participants compare AI to human alternatives and assess AI tools and resources.
Phrase: Comparing AI to human alternatives and tools.

3.
Concepts: interacts with ai naturally, treating ai as a natural interaction partner
Relationship: The concepts are closely related as participants interact with AI naturally, which implies treating AI as a natural interaction partner.
Criteria: Participants interact with AI in a natural and human-like manner.
Phrase: Interacting with AI naturally.

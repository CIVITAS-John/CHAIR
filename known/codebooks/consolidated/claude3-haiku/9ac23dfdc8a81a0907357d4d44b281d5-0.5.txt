You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

1. teaching experience, learning experience.
- Statements about the teaching experience of group members.
- The impact of the software's development on the community's learning experience, and the features of the software that enable students to actively engage in hands-on experiments and explore physics concepts.

2. group sharing, content sharing.
- Statements about sharing information within the group.
- The technical aspects of uploading and sharing content within the online community.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. Learning Experiences
Relationship: The concept of "learning experience" encompasses both the teaching experience of group members and the impact of the software's development on the community's learning.
Criteria: Statements about the teaching experience of group members, the impact of the software's development on the community's learning experience, and the features of the software that enable students to actively engage in hands-on experiments and explore physics concepts.
Label: Learning Experiences
Category: Learning Experiences

2. Community Participation
Relationship: The concepts of "group sharing" and "content sharing" are parallel and can be consolidated under the broader concept of community participation.
Criteria: Statements about sharing information within the group, and the technical aspects of uploading and sharing content within the online community.
Label: Community Participation

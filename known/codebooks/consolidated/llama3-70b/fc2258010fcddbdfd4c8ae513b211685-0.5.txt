You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Relationship: {The logical relationship between sub-codes in code 1}
Criteria: {Consolidated criteria of code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

1. iterative design, feedback and iteration.
- Continuous improvement of the software based on user feedback and evolving needs
- The ways in which the community's feedback influences the software's design and development

2. responsiveness, designer responsiveness.
- Assessing the designer's responsiveness to user inquiries and feedback
- Designer's reactions and adjustments based on user feedback

Here is the output format with the provided codes:

---
Categories: 
* Participatory Design
* Human-Centered Design

Definitions for each code:

1.
Relationship: Inclusive (iterative design is a broader concept that includes feedback and iteration)
Criteria: Continuous improvement of the software based on user feedback and evolving needs, incorporating community feedback into design and development
Label: Iterative Design Process
Category: Participatory Design

2.
Relationship: Hierarchical (responsiveness is a characteristic of designer responsiveness)
Criteria: Assessing the designer's responsiveness to user inquiries and feedback, reacting and adjusting based on user feedback
Label: Designer Responsiveness
Category: Human-Centered Design

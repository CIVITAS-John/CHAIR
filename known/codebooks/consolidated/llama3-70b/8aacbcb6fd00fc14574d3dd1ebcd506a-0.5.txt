You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
2. 
Concepts: {Repeat the input 2}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 2, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 2}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 2}

~~~
1.
Concepts: development goals and plans, development roadmap and timeline
- A designer discusses current research or development efforts and shares current priorities and future plans for the platform.
- A designer outlines the development roadmap for Physics Lab and discusses the development timeline and planning.

2.
Concepts: simulation design, simulation development
- Designing interactive physics simulations with flexible experiment setup and management
- Features or components in the software allow users to simulate and explore physics concepts.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: development goals and plans, development roadmap and timeline
Relationship: Inclusion (development goals and plans are part of the development roadmap and timeline)
Criteria: Designers discuss or outline current and future plans for the platform, including priorities, timelines, and roadmaps.
Label: Platform Development Planning

2.
Concepts: simulation design, simulation development
Relationship: Parallel (simulation design and simulation development are two related but distinct aspects of creating simulations)
Criteria: Features or components of the software allow users to simulate and explore physics concepts, and/or designing interactive physics simulations with flexible experiment setup and management.
Label: Simulation Creation

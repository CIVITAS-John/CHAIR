You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken.
8. P14: [Image]
9. P14: What do you mean?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top. 233333
11. P14: The condensed liquid won't flow back, right?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh, I see.
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year.
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be about electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay.
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?

Summary: This conversation involves a group of students and a designer discussing various topics related to physics, chemistry, and laboratory equipment. The conversation starts with a student introducing themselves and mentioning their age. Another student brings up a technical topic (MOSFETs), and the conversation shifts to discussing chemistry experiments, laboratory equipment, and the limitations of available software. The designer provides insights and advice, emphasizing the importance of focusing on exam perspectives while acknowledging the flexibility in practical applications. The conversation also includes sharing images, expressing agreement or acknowledgment, and introducing new technical topics (superconductors).

Notes:
- The conversation covers a range of topics related to physics, chemistry, and laboratory equipment, indicating a shared interest in these subjects among the participants.
- There is a mix of technical discussions, practical advice, and casual interactions, suggesting a friendly and supportive community.
- The designer seems to be a knowledgeable figure, providing guidance and insights to the students.
- The use of images, mentions, and reactions (e.g., "+1") contributes to the interactive nature of the conversation.
- The conversation touches on various aspects, including age, software limitations, exam perspectives, and future topics, suggesting a diverse range of interests and experiences among the participants.

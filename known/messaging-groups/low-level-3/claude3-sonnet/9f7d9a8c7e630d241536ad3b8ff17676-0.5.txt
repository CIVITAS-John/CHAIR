7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 1-202]
9. P14: How do you say it?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, they heat up quickly and save materials. But this is also fine, if you're a bit extravagant, you can cover a fish tank and connect a tube ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Won't the condensed liquid flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid has already been heated during reflux, making it less likely to break
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry things, probably won't be able to touch it before the second half of the year..
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be exactly the same as in the books, although during exams...
20. P1: There isn't any relatively realistic chemistry software at the moment
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was okay
22. Designer: But even the gods of organic chemistry can't solve it
23. Designer: So if you want to do it, you still have to consider it from the exam perspective
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section on electricity will have it, such as charged operations)
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a larger amount of computation...
32. P1: If you have the ability to make a comprehensive and free one, it should be very popular
33. P2: If the CPU is bad, it's game over
34. P11: Adding what you said, it wouldn't be "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
35. P1: It's a series of lab courses
36. P11: Hey, good idea
37. P2: Hehe
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is very annoying?
39. P2: @Designer Can you add a light sensor?
40. Designer: The problem is
41. Designer: Where does the light come from
42. P11: What about the light
43. Designer: Are you using a small bulb to illuminate the photoresistor?
44. P2: Tap with your hand
45. P14: I think there's no problem
46. Designer: Isn't that just a variable resistor, except the curve is different (â€¦â€¦)
47. P2: And a small light
48. Designer: Micro-payment maybe...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 1-245]
52. Designer: We'll see
53. Designer: If you don't have money, you can also click on ads
54. Designer: It's the approach of a conscientious game
55. P1: Put up ads
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: If you tap and release, it won't conduct electricity
58. Designer: Oh
59. Designer: Forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (â€¦â€¦)
60. P11: ðŸ˜‚
61. P11: Just about to say
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but that you don't know how to pay
63. P11: It can also be adapted to 3D touch
64. Designer: Just charge directly through the app store?

Thoughts: This conversation covers a wide range of topics related to designing an educational physics simulation software. It touches on chemistry concepts, components like MOSFETs and light sensors, payment models, user interactions, and more. To analyze it from multiple theoretical angles, we could look at the learning sciences perspective on simulating complex phenomena, the HCI considerations for intuitive user interfaces, and the participatory design aspects of incorporating user feedback.

Summary: The conversation started with discussing chemistry concepts and lab equipment, which led to suggestions for new components and features in Physics Lab like MOSFETs, light sensors, and non-standard operations. The designer shared insights on prioritizing chemistry for later, focusing on exams, and considering computation complexity. Ideas were proposed for monetization models like subscriptions, ads, and app store purchases. User interactions like tapping, 3D touch, and physical inputs were also discussed. Throughout, there was a mix of serious feedback, humorous banter, and clarification on technical details.

Notes: 
- Chemistry simulations are complex due to many variables, requiring substantial computational power
- User suggestions reveal desires for more advanced components, sensors, and interactions
- Payment model ideas show interest in supporting the software's development
- Balancing learning objectives, exam prep, and creative exploration seems important
- Participatory process with users inputting ideas from their experiences and needs

The conversation highlights key tensions in educational software design: simplifying complex phenomena vs. maintaining fidelity, aligning with curriculum vs. enabling free exploration, and finding sustainable monetization models vs. providing free access. The diverse perspectives offered by users could help navigate these tradeoffs through an iterative, participatory process.

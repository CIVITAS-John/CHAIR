You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation reveals the emergence of an online community around the Physics Lab software, with the designer actively engaging with users to understand their needs and incorporate feedback into the development process. Key themes include community participation and feedback, iterative and responsive design, scaffolding and support, scope and prioritization, and technological affordances. Users are providing suggestions for new features and functionalities, and the designer is responding by outlining the development roadmap and considerations, such as prioritizing electromagnetism before expanding to other areas. The conversation suggests a participatory design approach, where the community is actively shaping the software's evolution.
1. Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary tags: technological affordances
2. P4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary tags: development prioritization
3. Designer: Hmm.
Preliminary tags: development prioritization
4. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. P4232: Indeed
6. Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. P4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

12. Designer: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. P4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

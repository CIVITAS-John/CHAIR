You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes.
Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: browser functionality
Quotes:
- Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

2.
Label: experiment setup
Quotes:
- If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

3.
Label: network security
Quotes:
- Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

4.
Label: classroom technology
Quotes:
- Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

5.
Label: network management
Quotes:

6.
Label: simulation effectiveness
Quotes:
- The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

7.

Label: self introduction
Quotes:
- I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

12.
Label: product iteration
Quotes:

13.
Label: group management
Quotes:
- You can download Windows in the group files.

14.
Label: product roadmap
Quotes:
- We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

15.
Label: social presence
Quotes:
- It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]
- Oh, this is nice
- [Emoji][Emoji]

16.
Label: product updates
Quotes:
- Are there any other updates recently?
- [Image] Updates in preparation

17.
Label: transparency
Quotes:
- This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

18.
Label: technical details
Quotes:
- There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

19.
Label: private communication
Quotes:
- Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

20.
Label: designer's role
Quotes:

21.
Label: feature explanation
Quotes:
- For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

22.
Label: categorization
Quotes:
- Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

23.
Label: subject domain
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

24.
Label: educational constraints
Quotes:

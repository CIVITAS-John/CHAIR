You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary tags: avatar customization; user request; community guidelines; online identity
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary tags: platform availability; user inquiry; technology integration; pc platform
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary tags: user engagement; community building; teacher presence; avatar upload
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary tags: user role; teacher identity; community demographics
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Summary: The conversation revolves around the emergence of the online community around Physics Lab. The designers are engaging with users, sharing information, and gathering feedback. Users are inquiring about platform availability, making requests for specific features, and appreciating the designers' hard work. The designers are prioritizing development, seeking user input, and managing the community.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the designers are actively engaging with users, soliciting feedback, and prioritizing development based on user input. The community is starting to take shape, with users taking on roles (e.g., teachers) and making requests for specific features. The designers seem to be adopting a participatory design approach, involving users in the design process. I'll continue to monitor how this approach shapes the community and the development of Physics Lab.

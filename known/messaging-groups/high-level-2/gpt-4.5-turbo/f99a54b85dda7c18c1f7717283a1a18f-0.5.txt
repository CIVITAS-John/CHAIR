Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

3. P15: Plus one
4. P16: ＋1
5. P10: What does "+1" mean?
6. P11: It means "me too".
7. P13: +1 means the same opinion
8. P13: emmmm
9. P13: You can search on Baidu

* Summary
In the provided conversation snippet from Physics Lab's online message group, participants P14, P13, P15, and P16 express agreement or solidarity with a previous statement by using the term "+1". Participant P10 inquires about the meaning of "+1", and P11 and P13 clarify its meaning as indicating agreement or sharing the same opinion. P13 also suggests using Baidu to search for more information.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will examine how community norms and language evolve in an online setting, particularly focusing on the use of digital shorthand (e.g., "+1") and how members support each other's understanding of community-specific language. This analysis can be conducted through the lenses of learning sciences by examining how knowledge is socially constructed within the group, human-computer interaction by considering the role of the digital platform in facilitating communication, and participatory design by observing how users collaboratively shape the communication norms. Key questions might include: How do participants support newcomers in understanding community-specific terminologies? What does the use of shorthand say about the culture and efficiency of communication within the group? How do digital platforms influence the development of such community-specific languages?

# Community Norms and Language
## Use of Digital Shorthand
Definition: The adoption and understanding of concise, often symbolic language used to communicate efficiently in digital communications.
- Example quote 1: P10: What does "+1" mean?
- Example quote 2: P11: It means "me too".
- Example quote 3: P13: +1 means the same opinion

## Clarification and Support
Definition: Instances where community members help each other understand and navigate the norms or language used within the group.
- Example quote 1: P11: It means "me too".
- Example quote 2: P13: +1 means the same opinion
- Example quote 3: P13: You can search on Baidu

# Learning and Knowledge Sharing
## Inquiry and Response
Definition: The process where a question is posed by one community member and answered by others, facilitating shared understanding and learning.
- Example quote 1: P10: What does "+1" mean?
- Example quote 2: P11: It means "me too".
- Example quote 3: P13: +1 means the same opinion

## External Resources Suggestion
Definition: Recommendations made by participants to use external tools or sources to gain further information or clarification.
- Example quote 1: P13: You can search on Baidu

# Technology Facilitation
## Platform Utilization
Definition: How the features and limitations of the digital platform influence the communication style and norms of the community.
- Example quote 1: P13: You can search on Baidu
- Example quote 2: P10: What does "+1" mean?
- Example quote 3: P13: emmmm

This codebook provides a structured approach to analyze the conversation snippets for understanding the emergence and development of community norms, learning behaviors, and the role of technology in facilitating these processes within the Physics Lab's online community.

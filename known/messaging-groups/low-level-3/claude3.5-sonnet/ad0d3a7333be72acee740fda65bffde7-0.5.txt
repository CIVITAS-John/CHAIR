You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary tags: avatar customization; user interface; technical support; designer user interaction
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary tags: platform inquiry; user curiosity; community engagement
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary tags: designer responsiveness; user role inquiry; community demographics
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary tags: teacher participation; user identity confirmation; educational involvement
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: I'll analyze this conversation through the lens of community formation, user-designer interaction, and participatory design in educational technology. I'll consider how the designers are engaging with users, gathering feedback, and shaping the development process. I'll also look at how users are expressing their needs and contributing to the product's evolution. Key questions include: How are designers fostering community engagement? How are users, particularly educators, contributing to the design process? What does this reveal about the early stages of community formation around Physics Lab?

Summary: The conversation revolves around the early stages of Physics Lab's online community formation. Designers are actively engaging with users, particularly teachers, to gather feedback and shape the development process. Users are expressing their needs, making feature requests, and seeking information about the product. The designers are responsive, providing information about development plans and download instructions, and encouraging ongoing feedback. There's a focus on creating physics simulations that align with educational needs, indicating the product's orientation towards educational use. The community seems to be in its formative stages, with users and designers collaborating to improve the product.

Notes: 
1. The presence of teachers in the community suggests Physics Lab is targeting educational use.
2. Designers are using a participatory design approach, actively seeking and valuing user input.
3. There's a clear roadmap for development, with electrical and magnetism sections prioritized.
4. The community seems supportive and collaborative, with users expressing appreciation for the designers' efforts.
5. The product appears to be in early stages, with basic features like avatar customization still being developed.
6. There's an emphasis on multi-platform availability (PC, interactive whiteboard), indicating a focus on accessibility for various educational settings.
7. The designers are transparent about their development process, which may help build trust within the community.
8. Users are taking initiative in finding resources and information, suggesting an engaged and proactive community is forming.

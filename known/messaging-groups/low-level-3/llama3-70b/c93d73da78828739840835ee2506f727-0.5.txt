You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (13 in total):

Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary codes: @mention; technical inquiry; avatar customization
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary codes: platform inquiry; pc version suggestion
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary codes: uploading content; user role inquiry; teacher assumption
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary codes: affirmation; teacher identity
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: In this round of coding, I will focus on identifying the initial interactions between designers and users, exploring how the online community is taking shape. I will examine the language used, the types of questions being asked, and the responses from the designers. I will also consider how the designers are setting the tone for the community and how users are responding to their invitations for feedback.

Codes for each message:

1. Image sharing
2. @mention; technical inquiry; avatar customization
3. platform inquiry; pc version suggestion
4. uploading content; user role inquiry; teacher assumption
5. affirmation; teacher identity
6. community announcement; development plan sharing
7. open invitation; feedback solicitation
8. feature request; subject matter expertise; optical experiments
9. development prioritization; electrical section focus
10. feedback gathering; community involvement
11. appreciation; designer acknowledgement
12. platform inquiry; pc version request
13. file access; group file acknowledgment

Summary: The conversation begins with designers sharing images and users inquiring about PC versions and avatar customization. The designers respond by sharing development plans and inviting users to provide feedback. A user with subject matter expertise requests specific features for optical experiments, and the designers acknowledge the request while prioritizing their development focus. The conversation is characterized by a sense of community building, with users showing appreciation for the designers' work and seeking access to PC versions and group files.

Notes: It is interesting to see how the designers are actively engaging with users, soliciting feedback, and sharing development plans. This suggests a participatory design approach, where users are encouraged to contribute to the development process. The conversation also highlights the importance of understanding the users' needs and expertise, as seen in the feature request from User-4230. I hypothesize that this online community will continue to evolve through a collaborative and iterative process, with designers and users working together to shape the Physics Lab platform.

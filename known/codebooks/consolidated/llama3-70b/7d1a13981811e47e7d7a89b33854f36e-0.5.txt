You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
2. 
Concepts: {Repeat the input 2}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 2, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 2}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 2}

~~~
1.
Concepts: seeking update, platform updates
- A user seeks or requests an update.
- User inquires about updates, changes, or new features of the platform.

2.
Concepts: bug fix explanation, limitation explanation
- Designers explain bug fixes and identify potential bugs or limitations.
- Designers explain current limitations or constraints of the app, and explain potential solutions to limitations.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: seeking update, platform updates
Relationship: Inclusion (seeking update is a type of inquiry about platform updates)
Criteria: A user inquires about changes, new features, or updates of the platform.
Label: Inquiring About Platform Updates

2.
Concepts: bug fix explanation, limitation explanation
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts refer to designers explaining issues with the app)
Criteria: Designers provide explanations for bug fixes, potential bugs, or current limitations of the app, and potential solutions to these limitations.
Label: Designers' Explanations of App Issues

You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1. user input, user contributions.
- Instances where users suggest new features or improvements, or provide feedback and suggestions for the software.
- Instances where users contribute ideas or suggestions for the platform's design or features.

2. user involvement, feedback interaction.
- Instances where users provide input, suggestions, or feedback integrated into the design process.
- Instances where users provide feedback and the designer acknowledges, responds to, or incorporates this feedback.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Relationship: User input and user contributions are both forms of user engagement where users actively participate in suggesting or improving features and design.
Criteria: Instances where users provide suggestions, improvements, or feedback for the software or platform's design and features.
Label: User Contributions
Category: User Participation

2.
Relationship: User involvement and feedback interaction both describe the process of users providing feedback and the subsequent acknowledgment or incorporation of this feedback by designers.
Criteria: Instances where users provide feedback that is acknowledged, responded to, or incorporated into the design process by designers.
Label: Feedback Integration

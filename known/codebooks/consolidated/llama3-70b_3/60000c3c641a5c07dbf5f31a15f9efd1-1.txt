You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: notes ai's error resolution
Quotes:
- E01: And then very often, it could.  (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could often resolve errors by itself.

2.
Label: compares to other languages
Quotes:
- E01: And I got to admit like these days, NetLogo is the only language I use that does not have a smart editor. It doesn't autocomplete it or give me options of these are five variables that begin with those three letters. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's lack of smart code editors (we have one in TU that he would later see).

3.
Label: values seamless model updates
Quotes:
- E04: I really liked how, like the code that it generates, if you could just kind of place that into the model automatically.  (interviewer's observation) The capability to put into the model automatically.

4.
Label: integrates ai generated code fully
Quotes:
- E04: It'd be that I just take this and see what this does. This should just be a single node so it'll kind of overwrite what I already did. (interviewer's observation) E04 uses the AI-generated code completely when realizing time constraints.

5.
Label: enhancing error resolution
Quotes:
- E01: You know, so in point of fact, I considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can. So that when I come back to it later, I could figure out why it, why it's not working anymore. (interviewer's observation) Discussion on code complexity & quality. Plain / not-tricky code's advantage in maintenance.
- E04: It was really nice that it, like with the troubleshooting errors, for example, like at least in principle, I know that we had this one that we couldn't fix. It seemed like it was able to kind of do some better troubleshooting to a certain extent. (interviewer's observation) Better troubleshooting capability.
- E04: I think that it's nice that it's, it clarifies error codes. I think that's probably where people who are new get stuck the most is trying to figure out the syntax and all the different errors. (interviewer's observation) The capability to clarify the errors.

6.
Label: critiques limited options
Quotes:
- E04: Like in this type of, like, like I was saying with this window, for example, where it's giving you the options and basically there was that one time where the only option was for it to explain itself.  Which makes sense, but it'd be nice if I could just kind of like forego that and just keep doing, you know, But you know, for someone that's probably not as useful for someone who's like still learning, but like, I guess for someone who's more experienced, it's nice to be able to just like skip over things that you already know. (interviewer's observation) Options too limited; tension between a novice-oriented/expert-oriented design.

7.
Label: deals with older net logo versions
Quotes:
- E04: I guess, in their databases, they still have like, NetLogo 5 in there and stuff. So like, for example, you know, the anonymous functions, they still use like, the old, sometimes I'll get like, the old functionality for the anonymous functions. (interviewer's observation) Writing code in older versions of NetLogo

8.
Label: long code
Quotes:
- E01: It's about, let's see, what did I count is 3800 lines of code. Well, first I couldn't feed it all the ChatGPT can only take it 1800 lines at a time. And then I said, you know, can you tell me what this does? And it basically said, no. ... I can live with that again. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT's limitation on reading long code pieces.

9.
Label: ai's potential use case as an educational tool & for greater degree of personalization
Quotes:
- E01: Can it design a generic learning management path? Because a lot of people can develop systems, but they're not good teachers. (interviewer's observation) Hypothetically: maybe AI could be used for building learning pathways.

10.
Label: constraint
Quotes:

14.
Label: inferring
Quotes:
- E01: Well, I cut the entire user's question. It figured out what I wanted. I didn't even tell it what I wanted. It just told me. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could infer E01's need from the input context.

15.
Label: ai ability (positive): customizationl
Quotes:
- E01: I call it hive feedback system, where if anyone in the world learns a new fact, or like, Oh, if you're a nurse, here's the word. If you're a transcriptionist, here's the word. If anybody learns it, then it goes into the system into the cloud. And now the cloud won't make that mistake anymore.

(interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how the human-AI collaborative system could be used to increase general productivity.

16.
Label: error management
Quotes:

17.
Label: learning process improvement
Quotes:

20.
Label: hiring criteria
Quotes:
- E01: But if a tool can do your, can do most of your work in five minutes, why would you spend two weeks? ... I would never hire someone who spent two weeks solving a problem that they could do in five minutes. (interviewer's observation) AI might be able to save people's time.

21.
Label: less need to interact with others.. save interaction effort
Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

25.
Label: values customizable options
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

30.
Label: user acceptance

31.
Label: ai effectiveness
Quotes:
- E01: I've observed when I tried to suggest ChatGPT to other people, they're, um, they are amazed at the output that I can get.

32.
Label: clear process

He has a clear idea & established process of building ABMs.

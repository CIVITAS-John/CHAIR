You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* communication dynamics
* community development
* design collaboration
* design facilitation
* feedback integration
* interaction design
* knowledge-driven design
* learning development
* learning engagement
* miscellaneous
* problem-solving strategies
* resource utilization
* technology-enhanced learning

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: expressing reactions, express emotions and personality through language
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve users conveying their emotions and personality through language, albeit in different contexts (responding to updates/announcements vs. responding to comments).
Criteria: Users convey emotions and personality through language or emojis in response to updates, announcements, or comments.
Phrase: Expressing emotional reactions

2.
Concepts: proposing new features, gathering community feedback
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve users providing input to the Physics Lab online community, either by suggesting new features or reacting to existing ones.
Criteria: Users suggest new features or provide feedback on existing ones to inform community development.
Phrase: Soliciting community input

3.
Concepts: previewing updates, discussing development updates and feature expansions
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve designers providing information about upcoming changes to the Physics Lab online community.
Criteria: Designers provide information about upcoming updates, features, or changes to the online community.
Phrase: Sharing development plans

4.
Concepts: providing context, providing design explanations
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve designers clarifying their design decisions and intentions.
Criteria: Designers provide context or explanations to support their design decisions and objectives.
Phrase: Clarifying design intentions

5.
Concepts: explaining technical artifacts, discuss and explain system limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve designers explaining technical aspects of the application.
Criteria: Designers explain technical aspects or limitations of the application to users.
Phrase: Explaining technical constraints

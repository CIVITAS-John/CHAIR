You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (18 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...
...
18. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary codes: : personal anecdote; technical workaround
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary codes: : agreement; acknowledgement
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary codes: : feature request; user feedback; workflow suggestion
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary codes: : feature confirmation; development roadmap
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary codes: : context inquiry; use case understanding
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary codes: : context explanation; institutional constraint; anecdote
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Thoughts: For this initial round of coding, I'll focus on describing each message with low-level codes, considering the research question of how the Physics Lab online community emerged. I'll analyze the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I'll look for codes that reveal the designers' and users' intentions, actions, and interactions.

Codes for each message:

1. Personal anecdote; technical workaround
2. Agreement; acknowledgement
3. Feature request; user feedback; workflow suggestion
4. Feature confirmation; development roadmap
5. Context inquiry; use case understanding
6. Context explanation; institutional constraint; anecdote
7. Emotional response; humor
8. Design consideration; local export requirement
9. Context explanation; institutional constraint
10. Acknowledgement; understanding
11. Positive feedback; user experience
12. Inquiry about user's profession
13. Professional background; user profile
14. Development update; release timeline
15. Apology; social courtesy
16. Inquiry about download
17. Polite expression; apology
18. Feature suggestion; collaboration idea

Summary: The conversation starts with a technical discussion about a workaround and a feature request. The designer and users exchange information about the context of use, including institutional constraints and technical limitations. The conversation also touches on the user experience, with positive feedback about the simulation effect. The designers provide updates about the development roadmap and respond to user inquiries.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the designers engage with users, acknowledging their feedback and providing explanations about the development process. The conversation reveals the importance of understanding the context of use, including institutional constraints. The users' feedback and suggestions are valuable for the designers, who are actively considering these inputs in their development roadmap.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

13.
Label: reinforce community knowledge
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

14.
Label: designer 1 outlines focus areas

Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

16.
Label: inform about changes

18.
Label: user 4232 suggests alternative system
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

19.
Label: acknowledge shared progress
Quotes:
- User: Updated

20.
Label: manage project scope
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

21.
Label: recognize user requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

22.
Label: validate designers' efforts

Label: encourage users to engage with the editor
Quotes:
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

30.
Label: detailed educational needs
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

31.
Label: designer 1 provides technical insight
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

32.
Label: acknowledge future features
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

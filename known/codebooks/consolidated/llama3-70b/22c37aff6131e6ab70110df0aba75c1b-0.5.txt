You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (7 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: using ai-generated code as a reference, using ai-generated code for reference
Relationship: The two concepts are synonymous, both describing the use of AI-generated code as a point of reference.
Criteria: Users utilize AI-generated code as a reference to inform their setup needs.
Phrase: Use as a reference

2.
Concepts: debugging ai-generated code, evaluating ai-generated code
Relationship: Debugging is a more specific action that falls under the broader category of evaluating AI-generated code.
Criteria: Users thoroughly examine and test AI-generated code to identify errors or issues.
Phrase: Debug and evaluate

3.
Concepts: correcting ai-generated code errors, identifying errors or potential bugs
Relationship: Identifying errors is a necessary step before correcting them, making these concepts sequential and related.
Criteria: Users detect and rectify mistakes or potential issues in AI-generated code.
Phrase: Correct errors

4.
Concepts: preferring to teach netlogo, preference for human-to-human knowledge transfer
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as teaching NetLogo implies a preference for human-to-human knowledge transfer.
Criteria: Users prioritize sharing knowledge and expertise with others through direct instruction.
Phrase: Prefer human-to-human teaching

5.
Concepts: ai support for learning, seeking ai assistance for learning
Relationship: The two concepts are synonymous, both describing the use of AI as a learning aid.
Criteria: Users leverage AI as a tool to facilitate their learning of NetLogo concepts.
Phrase: Seek AI assistance

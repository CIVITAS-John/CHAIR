Thoughts: To analyze this conversation for open coding and identify low-level tags related to the emergence of the online community, I will focus on social interactions, expressions of agreement/disagreement, information sharing, and community norms or practices.

Messages:
1. P16: +1|Expressing agreement
2. P10: May I ask what does "+1" mean?|Seeking information, Questioning community norm
3. P11: It means "me too".|Explaining community norm
4. P13: +1 means the same opinion.|Explaining community norm
5. P13: emmmm|Filler
6. P13: You can search on Baidu.|Suggesting information source
7. P10: Oh, I see. Thank you.|Acknowledging explanation
8. P2: +1|Expressing agreement
9. P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for.|Off-topic, Unrelated to discussion
10. P17: I'm just looking.|Off-topic, Unrelated to discussion

Summary: The conversation starts with P16 expressing agreement with "+1". P10 asks for clarification on the meaning of "+1", which prompts P11 and P13 to explain that it means expressing the same opinion or agreement. P13 also suggests searching on Baidu for more information. P10 acknowledges the explanation. P2 also expresses agreement with "+1". The conversation then goes off-topic with P14 and P17 making unrelated comments.

Notes: This conversation shows how members of the online community use specific expressions like "+1" to indicate agreement, and how new members seek clarification on these community norms. It also demonstrates how members share information and explain norms to help integrate new members. The off-topic comments at the end suggest that the conversation may have drifted or new topics were introduced.

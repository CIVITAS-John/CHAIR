You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: ai utility appreciation, recognize ai's time-saving potential
- General appreciation for AI's utility in completing tasks efficiently.
- The user values and recognizes AI's potential to significantly reduce task completion time.

2.
Concepts: proposes own fixes to ai, independently debug ai-generated errors
- Proposes specific fixes or improvements to AI-generated code.
- Users identify and manually debug errors in AI-generated code using their own corrections.

3.
Concepts: human-ai: seek help, engaging in iterative debugging
- Users interact with the AI to debug code iteratively and seek help by verifying and fixing errors.
- Users engage in iterative debugging with AI's help by providing specific error messages and code lines, and share their experiences and strategies in iterative problem-solving.

4.
Concepts: novice, novice challenge of using ai
- Discusses the needs and challenges of novice users in understanding and debugging AI-generated code.
- Novices face challenges when collaborating with AI, particularly in debugging and designing code structures.

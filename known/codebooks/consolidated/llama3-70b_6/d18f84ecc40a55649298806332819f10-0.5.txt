You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: user-centered design
- The extent to which the users' needs and preferences are being incorporated into the software's development.
- The extent to which the designers prioritize the needs and preferences of the user community in the design and development of the simulation tool.
- The approach of designing features based on user needs and contexts.
- User-centered design is an approach to designing products or services that focuses on the needs and perspectives of users.
- Designing Physics Lab with the user's needs and context in mind.

2.
Concepts: prioritization of content
- The designers' plans for prioritizing the development of different content areas within the Physics Lab application.
- Discussing the order in which different sections of Physics Lab will be completed.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: user-centered design
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected, as they all describe the focus on users' needs and perspectives in the design and development of the simulation tool.
Criteria: Designers prioritize and incorporate users' needs and preferences into the development of the software.
Phrase: Incorporating user needs into design

2.
Concepts: prioritization of content
Relationship: The concepts are logically related, as they both describe the planning and ordering of content development within the Physics Lab application.
Criteria: Designers plan and order the development of different content areas within the application.
Phrase: Prioritizing content development

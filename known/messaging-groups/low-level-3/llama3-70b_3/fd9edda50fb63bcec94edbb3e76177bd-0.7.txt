You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?

Thoughts: In this conversation, I'm looking for signs of community emergence, such as requests for features or technical issues. I'll also consider how the Designer responds to these requests, and how participants interact with each other. From a learning sciences perspective, I'll examine if and how participants are learning from each other or the Designer.

Tags for each message:
1. (no text)
2. technical issue; avatar customization; community engagement
3. platform inquiry; PC version availability

Summary: The conversation starts with an image from P8, followed by a question from Morning Tea Moonlight about uploading a high-definition avatar. The Designer is asked to assist with this technical issue. P4229 then inquires about a PC version of Physics Lab.

Notes: It seems like the community is already forming around technical discussions and feature requests. The Designer is being pulled into these conversations, which might indicate a sense of ownership or responsibility towards the community. I'm curious to see how the Designer responds to these requests and how it affects the community's dynamics.

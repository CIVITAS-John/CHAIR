You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: The conversation so far seems to revolve around the Physics Lab community members exploring and troubleshooting the functionality of the lab equipment and software. The messages indicate a mix of community engagement, design interest, image sharing, and requests for guidance on how to set up and use the system. To analyze this further, I will consider perspectives from learning sciences (e.g., how the community is supporting each other's learning), human-computer interaction (e.g., the usability and accessibility of the system), and participatory design (e.g., the level of user involvement in the design process).

Tags for each message:
1. community engagement; learning guidance; play
2. community engagement; design interest; troubleshooting
3. community engagement
4. image sharing
5. image sharing
6. community engagement
7. community engagement; troubleshooting; guidance request
8. community engagement; support
9. troubleshooting; system description
10. troubleshooting; system description
11. troubleshooting; guidance request
12. troubleshooting; guidance request
13. troubleshooting; guidance request
14. image sharing
15. troubleshooting; guidance
16. community engagement
17. image sharing
18. troubleshooting; guidance request
19. clarification request

Summary: The conversation so far shows the Physics Lab community members actively engaging with each other to explore and troubleshoot the functionality of the lab equipment and software. They are sharing images, asking for guidance on how to set up and use the system, and providing support to one another. The messages indicate a collaborative and iterative learning process, where the community members are working together to understand and make the most of the Physics Lab tools and features.

Notes: The community seems to be in the early stages of exploring and getting familiar with the Physics Lab system. The messages suggest a mix of design interest, usability challenges, and a desire for more guidance and support. It will be interesting to see how the community continues to evolve and how the designer responds to the users' needs and feedback. The participatory design approach, if present, could play a key role in shaping the system's development and the community's engagement.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

* Summary 
This conversation involves designers of Physics Lab interacting with users, who are teachers interested in using the software. The designers share information about downloading and accessing Physics Lab, while users provide feedback and suggestions for features they would like to see included, such as demonstrations of mechanical waves and optical experiments.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can explore themes related to:

1. User needs and requirements gathering
2. Software design and development processes 
3. Teacher perspectives on physics education technology
4. Community building and user engagement

We will code relevant phrases under these themes, drawing connections to theoretical frameworks where applicable.

# User needs and requirements gathering 
## Soliciting user feedback
Definition: Instances where designers actively seek input from users on desired features/improvements
- "If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up."
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~"

## Proposing new features  
Definition: Users suggesting new functionality to be added to the software
- "Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments."

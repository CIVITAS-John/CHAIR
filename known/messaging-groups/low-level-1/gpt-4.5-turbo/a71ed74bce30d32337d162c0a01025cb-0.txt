You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P8: [Image]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.
6. Designer: 
7. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are in the group announcement.
8. Designer: Feel free to share any suggestions and needs.
9. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
10. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
11. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
12. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
13. P4231: [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
14. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.

Thoughts: The conversation appears to be between a designer and several participants (P8, P4229, P4230, P4231) in a Physics Lab online messaging group. The focus is on the development and use of a physics lab software or application. The conversation includes requests for features, updates on development plans, and user interactions. The goal is to identify tags related to social interactions and community building within this online group.

Analysis for all 14 messages:
1. image-sharing, user-interaction
2. technical-question, user-support
3. clarification-question, software-specific
4. user-verification, personal-question
5. identity-confirmation
6. (no content to tag)
7. announcement, information-sharing
8. feedback-request, community-engagement
9. feature-request, respect-expression
10. development-prioritization, feature-planning
11. feedback-gathering, memory-concern
12. gratitude-expression, user-support
13. help-request, user-interaction
14. self-sufficiency, problem-resolution

Summary: The conversation in the Physics Lab's online messaging group revolves around the development and enhancement of a physics lab application. It includes interactions such as feature requests, updates on development plans, and user support. The designer actively engages with the users, soliciting feedback and responding to their needs, which fosters a sense of community and collaboration.

Notes: The tags identified highlight a community that is actively involved in shaping the development of their tool. The interactions are respectful and constructive, with users expressing gratitude and the designer seeking to prioritize tasks based on user feedback. This analysis helps in understanding how the online community around the Physics Lab software is emerging and evolving through collaborative and supportive interactions.

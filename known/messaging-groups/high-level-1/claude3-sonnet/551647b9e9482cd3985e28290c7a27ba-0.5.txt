3. P2: +1
4. P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for.
5. P17: I'm just looking.
6. P4: No problem.
7. P2: Have you studied astronomy?
8. P5: No.
9. P11: Are you referring to the scale ratio? @P2 
10. P17: [Image]
11. P11: Sorry, no, the popularization of astronomy is limited to Beijing.
12. P17: [Image]
13. P17: [Image]
14. P17: [Image]
15. P2: [Image]
16. P1: Wow.
17. P11: ？？？
18. P4: That's not good.
19. P2: That's correct.
20. P1: Strong.
21. P17: [Image]
22. P4: Water, gold, earth, fire, wood, soil.

24. P11: Please take a look.
25. P2: ……
26. P2: Oh.
27. P2: What about the moon?
28. P4: [Image]
29. P11: It orbits the Earth.
30. P11: 23333
31. P2: I'm talking about the software.
32. P11: Then ask the group owner.
33. Designer: Mars is outside the Earth.
34. Designer: What's the problem?
35. P4: No problem.
36. P2: What about the moon?
37. P1: The moon is not drawn, right?
38. P14: Maybe it hasn't been done yet.
39. P14: 
40. Designer: Last time it was too rushed.
41. P4: The moon is useless.
42. P4: 2333
43. Designer: It depends on the scale.
44. P2: Who said that?
45. P4: universe sandbox
46. Designer: There will be multiple presets.
47. Designer: Because in reality, you encounter many possible questions, many of which are about near-Earth space stations.
48. P11: Yes.
49. Designer: Artificial satellite orbits.
50. Designer: These will involve more.
51. Designer: Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter this normally...
52. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
53. P1: John, have you become more Android?
54. Designer: No, I'll update it today.
55. P17: [Image]
56. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
57. Designer: I'll buy a ticket to space.
58. P17: It's the starry sky.
59. P1: Don't imitate it exactly the same.
60. P14: There are also software imitating celestial bodies on Steam.
61. P14: I can't remember if it's 78 or 79.
62. P14: [Image]
63. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
64. P11: Look it up online, this is not something that can be solved in a few words. @P2 
65. P2: Can we add a motor? @Designer 
66. P14: I think I should focus on doing mathematics.
67. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
68. Designer: We will be relatively simple, practical (close to the exam), and affordable.
69. P11: 2333
70. P11: Ask the group owner.
71. Designer: After all, it's not specifically about astronomy.
72. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
73. P2: [Image]
74. P2: From what I know currently.
75. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in the Physics Lab?
76. Designer: Motor simulation is more complicated, and it depends on the load.
77. Designer: Calculated it...
78. P2: How was it calculated?
79. P11: Okay.
80. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
81. P11: [Image]
82. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but an atomized model.
83. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
84. P1: Server?
85. P11: Hahaha
86. Designer: Standalone.
87. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
88. Designer: Two types of motors.
89. P1: Are you going to the server?
90. P2: Brushed motor.
91. P2: It's not a brushless motor that connects to AC.
92. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
93. P14: 
94. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
95. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
96. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
97. P14: [Image]
98. P2: Has it been burned?
99. P4: Just play a rotating animation if you turn on the power, that's it 23333.
100. P2: Do we still need algorithms?
101. P4: 2333, it's simple.
102. P2: Algorithms are not simple.
103. P2: IGDT can also add @Designer 
104. P13: [Image]
105. P13: Are you all fake?
106. P13: Are you from outer space?
107. P13: I don't understand.
108. P2: Transistors can also be used.
109. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do normal experiments like this...
110. P11: 233 is in electronic circuits.
111. P11: I don't understand either.
112. P2: In the CPU.
113. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned some when I took an optional course in circuits.
114. P2: Add a bipolar capacitor.
115. P2: I learned by myself.
116. P11: That's great, if you have hobbies in it.
117. P14: @P11 Are there still distinctions between arts and sciences now?
118. P2: no
119. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
120. P14: [Image]
121. P14: ...Let me get admitted first.
122. P2: I'm still in the second year of junior high school.
123. P11: Keep it up.
124. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
125. P2: What about MOSFETs?
126. P2: @Designer 
127. P17: [Image]
128. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
129. P2: +1

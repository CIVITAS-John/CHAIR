Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P14: Except me
2. P13: ＋1
3. P15: +1 again
4. P16: ＋1
5. P10: May I ask what "+1" means?
6. P11: It means I feel the same way.
7. P13: +1 means having the same opinion
8. P13: emmmm
9. P13: You can check Baidu

* Summary
In this conversation, participants in the Physics Lab's online message group use the term "+1" to express agreement or shared opinion with a previous statement made by another participant. The conversation includes a query about the meaning of "+1" and responses that clarify its meaning.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction, I will consider theories from learning sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and participatory design. From a learning sciences perspective, I will explore how community norms and language are shared among members, facilitating social learning. In terms of HCI, I will examine the use of digital communication tools (like shorthand symbols "+1") and how they support user interaction and understanding. From a participatory design viewpoint, I will consider how the interaction reflects the co-construction of the community's communicative practices. Key questions include: How do community members teach each other about shared symbols? How do digital tools facilitate or hinder communication? How do members collaboratively develop and negotiate meanings within their community?

# Community Norms and Learning
## Shared Language and Symbols
Definition: This code refers to instances where community members use or explain symbols and language that are specific to the group.
- "P10: May I ask what "+1" means?"
- "P11: It means I feel the same way."
- "P13: +1 means having the same opinion"

## Peer Learning
Definition: Instances where participants learn from each other through direct interaction or observation within the group.
- "P10: May I ask what "+1" means?"
- "P11: It means I feel the same way."
- "P13: +1 means having the same opinion"

# Digital Communication Tools
## Use of Digital Symbols
Definition: How members of the online community use digital symbols to communicate quickly and effectively.
- "P13: ＋1"
- "P15: +1 again"
- "P16: ＋1"

## Queries and Clarifications
Definition: Moments where participants seek or provide clarification on the use of digital tools or symbols within the community.
- "P10: May I ask what "+1" means?"
- "P11: It means I feel the same way."
- "P13: You can check Baidu"

# Participatory Design
## Co-construction of Community Practices
Definition: How community members collaboratively create and refine their communication practices and norms.
- "P10: May I ask what "+1" means?"
- "P11: It means I feel the same way."
- "P13: +1 means having the same opinion"

## External References and Learning Resources
Definition: Refers to how participants reference external sources to aid understanding or add depth to the community's knowledge base.

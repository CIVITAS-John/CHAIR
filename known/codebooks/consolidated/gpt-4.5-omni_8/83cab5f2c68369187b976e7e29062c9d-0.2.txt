You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

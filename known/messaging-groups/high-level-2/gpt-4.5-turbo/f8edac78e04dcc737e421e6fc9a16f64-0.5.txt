Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P16: ＋1
2. P10: May I ask what "+1" means?
3. P11: It means I feel the same way.
4. P13: +1 means having the same opinion
5. P13: emmmm
6. P13: You can check Baidu
7. P10: Oh, got it, thanks.
8. P2: +1
9. P14: Some things inside the beaker also require payment.
10. P17: I'll take another look.
11. P4: No problem at all.

* Summary
The conversation in the Physics Lab's online message group revolves around clarifying the meaning of the term "+1" and briefly touches upon logistical aspects of laboratory work, such as payments for materials in a beaker.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction, we'll consider the emergence of community norms and language, the role of technology in facilitating communication, and how participatory design principles manifest in the group dynamics. We'll examine how community members support each other's understanding of group-specific language (like "+1"), how technology (e.g., referencing Baidu) aids in this communal learning, and how the group handles practical issues collaboratively. Questions to guide the analysis include: How do members negotiate and clarify community-specific language? What role does technology play in supporting these interactions? How do participatory design principles appear in these exchanges, particularly in how members address practical concerns?

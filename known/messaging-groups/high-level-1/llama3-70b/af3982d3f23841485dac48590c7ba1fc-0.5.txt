Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...

1. P8: [Image 0]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without watermark for this profile picture?
3. P4229: pc version?
4. Designer: Let me upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are both in the group announcement.
7. Designer: If you have any suggestions or needs, feel free to bring them up.
8. P4230: First, let's pay tribute to the experts, then I have a small request. Can you make a dynamic demonstration of mechanical wave and mechanical vibration, such as the propagation of transverse waves and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, I really hope to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, polarizers, etc., to demonstrate optical experiments~
9. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing the electricity section first, then move on to magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember.
11. P4230: Okay okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
13. P4231: I saw the files in the group, thank you.

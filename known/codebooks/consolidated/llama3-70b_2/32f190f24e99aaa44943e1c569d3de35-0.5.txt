You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: navigating community space
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

6.
Label: demonstrating domain expertise
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

Label: promising it will realize
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

9.
Label: outlining the software's focus
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

10.
Label: clarifying version details
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

11.
Label: promoting convenience
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

12.
Label: development update
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

13.
Label: use the metaphor of craftsmanship to refer to app development

- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

14.
Label: expressing that the software should be compatible with machines from 2008 onwards
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

15.
Label: providing information about downloading the windows version
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

16.
Label: set development scope
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

19.
Label: provide rationale
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

20.
Label: ensuring user satisfaction
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

21.
Label: inquiring about expansion to other physics domains
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

25.
Label: politely requests assistance
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

26.
Label: plan future update
Quotes:

27.
Label: inquiring about update status
Quotes:
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?

28.
Label: a focus on practical
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

29.
Label: detailing upcoming features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

30.
Label: accepting suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

31.
Label: suggesting the use of internal resistance simulation
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

32.
Label: invite feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

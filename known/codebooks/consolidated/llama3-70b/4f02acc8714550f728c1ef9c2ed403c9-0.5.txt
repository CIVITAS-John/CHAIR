You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: community update, project announcements
Relationship: Parallel
Criteria: Designers share information with the community through updates or announcements about the project.
Label: Project Communication

2.
Concepts: feature introduction, feature explanation
Relationship: Inclusion (feature explanation is a part of feature introduction)
Criteria: Designers or users provide explanations or demonstrations to help users understand the purpose or functionality of a feature.
Label: Feature Clarification

3.
Concepts: educational experience sharing, user experience in educational contexts
Relationship: Intersection (users share their experiences in educational contexts)
Criteria: Users discuss or share their experiences, effectiveness, or challenges of using the software in educational settings.
Label: Educational Experience Sharing

4.
Concepts: user communication, real-time communication
Relationship: Inclusion (real-time communication is a part of user communication)
Criteria: Users and designers engage in conversations or exchanges, either in real-time or not.
Label: User Interaction

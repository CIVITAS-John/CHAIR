You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: augmentation of human capabilities
- Instances where the interviewee perceives LLM-driven interfaces as tools to enhance human abilities rather than replace them.
- The belief that AI should enhance rather than replace human abilities.

2.
Concepts: evaluates ai responses
- The process by which the interviewee assesses the quality and usefulness of the outputs generated by the LLM-driven interface.
- The user recognizes the need to critically evaluate the AI's responses and use their own judgment.

3.
Concepts: human-ai collaboration
- The interviewee's perception of AI as a collaborative partner in the coding and learning process.
- Participant views AI as a tool to augment human capabilities, rather than replace them.

4.
Concepts: novice challenges
- The interviewee's observations on the difficulties faced by beginners in coding and how AI might address them.
- Participant highlights challenges faced by novices in seeking help.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: augmentation of human capabilities
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as the perception of LLM-driven interfaces as tools to enhance human abilities is rooted in the belief that AI should augment rather than replace human capabilities.
Criteria: Interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces as tools that enhance human abilities without replacing them.
Phrase: Enhance human capabilities

2.
Concepts: evaluates ai responses
Relationship: The two concepts are logically connected, as the process of evaluating AI responses is driven by the recognition of the need to critically assess AI outputs.
Criteria: Interviewees assess the quality and usefulness of LLM-driven interface outputs using their own judgment.
Phrase: Critically evaluate AI responses

3.
Concepts: human-ai collaboration
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as the perception of AI as a collaborative partner is rooted in the view that AI augments human capabilities rather than replacing them.
Criteria: Interviewees view LLM-driven interfaces as collaborative tools that augment human capabilities.
Phrase: Collaborate with AI

4.
Concepts: novice challenges
Relationship: The two concepts are logically connected, as the difficulties faced by beginners in coding are addressed by the potential of AI to provide support.
Criteria: Interviewees identify challenges faced by novices in coding and seek AI-based solutions to address them.
Phrase: Address novice challenges

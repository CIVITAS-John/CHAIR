You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Summary of previous conversation: The online community in Physics Lab is actively engaged in discussing software updates, user needs, and platform development. Users inquire about features, request a user manual, suggest new functionalities, and provide feedback. The Designer responds by announcing updates, discussing future plans, and considering user suggestions for improving the platform.
1. Designer: For example, connecting the circuit diagram to see the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary tags: software feature demonstration
2. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary tags: feedback categorization suggestion
3. Designer: Hmm.
Preliminary tags: acknowledgment of user input
4. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. P4232: Indeed
6. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
7. Designer: I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
8. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
9. P4232: This is a really good idea
10. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

12. Designer: [Image 92]This one.
13. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.

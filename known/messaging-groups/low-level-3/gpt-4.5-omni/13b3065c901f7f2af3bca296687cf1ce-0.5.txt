You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P8: [Image 0]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without watermark for this profile picture?
Preliminary tags: designer interaction; technical support; user assistance
3. P4229: pc version?
Preliminary tags: platform inquiry; user curiosity; cross platform usage
4. Designer: Let me upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary tags: real time support; user identification; teacher presence
5. P4229: Yes.
Preliminary tags: user role; teacher identity; community member
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are both in the group announcement.
7. Designer: If you have any suggestions or needs, feel free to bring them up.
8. P4230: First, let's pay tribute to the experts, then I have a small request. Can you make a dynamic demonstration of mechanical wave and mechanical vibration, such as the propagation of transverse waves and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, I really hope to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, polarizers, etc., to demonstrate optical experiments~
9. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing the electricity section first, then move on to magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember.
11. P4230: Okay okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
13. P4231: I saw the files in the group, thank you.

13. resource discovery; gratitude; user acknowledgment; self-sufficiency

Summary: The conversation highlights the interactive nature of the Physics Lab online community, where the designer actively engages with users, providing technical support and gathering feedback. Users, including teachers, participate by making feature requests and sharing their needs for instructional tools. The designer prioritizes development tasks based on user feedback and maintains open communication. The community members express gratitude and share resources, fostering a supportive environment.

Notes: The designer plays a crucial role in maintaining the community's engagement by responding promptly and considering user feedback. The presence of teachers indicates that the platform is used for educational purposes, and their requests for specific features suggest a need for comprehensive instructional tools. The participatory design approach is evident as users contribute to the platform's development. The use of emojis and greetings shows a friendly and approachable community atmosphere.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

* Summary
The conversation revolves around the development and refinement of a simulated experiment assessment function for an electricity module in Physics Lab's online platform. Designer-1 discusses specific features and seeks feedback from users, particularly concerning the representation of circuit diagrams. The interaction includes planning, soliciting user input, and discussing upcoming updates.

* Plan
The analysis will focus on how participatory design practices, human-computer interaction principles, and learning sciences are reflected in the development of Physics Lab's online community. Key areas of interest include the engagement of users in the design process, the adaptation of tools to user needs, and the communication strategies employed by the designers. Questions guiding the analysis might include: How are users involved in the design process? What design choices are made to enhance user interaction and learning? How do designers respond to technical challenges and user feedback?

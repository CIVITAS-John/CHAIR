You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: identifying novice challenges, reflecting on novice challenges
- Participants identify and reflect on the challenges and struggles that novices or beginners may face when working with AI in NetLogo.
- Participants identify challenges for novices and recognize the challenges of bulk coding.
- Participants note beginners' struggles with errors, the challenge of assisting novice programmers, and reflect on novice challenges in programming and debugging.

2.
Concepts: identifying design tension, recognizing design limitations
- Participants identify design tension, novice-expert design tensions, and limited options.
- Participants recognize design limitations and identify difficulties due to non-expert-friendly design.

3.
Concepts: recognizing novice-expert tension, contrasting expert and novice ai interaction
- Participants recognize the tension between novice and expert needs in AI-assisted development.
- Participant contrasts expert and novice interactions with AI, highlighting different expectations and approaches

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: identifying novice challenges, reflecting on novice challenges
Relationship: The concepts are related as identifying novice challenges is a precursor to reflecting on those challenges, implying a sequential and causal relationship.
Criteria: Participants identify and reflect on the challenges faced by novices when working with AI in NetLogo.
Phrase: Identifying and reflecting on novice challenges

2.
Concepts: identifying design tension, recognizing design limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as identifying design tension may lead to recognizing design limitations, implying a causal relationship.
Criteria: Participants identify design tension and recognize limitations in AI-assisted development.
Phrase: Identifying design limitations and tensions

3.
Concepts: recognizing novice-expert tension, contrasting expert and novice ai interaction
Relationship: The concepts are related as recognizing novice-expert tension is a prerequisite to contrasting expert and novice AI interactions, implying a sequential relationship.
Criteria: Participants recognize the tension between novice and expert needs and contrast their AI interactions.
Phrase: Recognizing and contrasting novice-expert AI interactions

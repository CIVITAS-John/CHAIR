You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: acknowledged expertise; requested specific features; detailed educational needs; provided constructive feedback
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: outlined development priorities; communicated project timeline; managed user expectations
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: planned future user engagement; emphasized iterative feedback; acknowledged memory limitations
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: expressed gratitude; acknowledged designer's effort; fostered positive community atmosphere
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: used emoji to greet community; inquired about download options; sought specific version information
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: confirmed finding information; expressed gratitude; demonstrated self sufficiency
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Summary: User-4230 began the conversation by acknowledging the expertise of the designers and requested specific features for mechanical and optical experiments, providing detailed educational needs and constructive feedback. Designer-1 responded by outlining the development priorities, indicating that the electrical section would be completed first, followed by magnetism and other parts, managing user expectations. Designer-1 also mentioned that user opinions would be gathered again before starting mechanics to ensure all feedback is considered. User-4230 expressed gratitude for the designers' efforts, fostering a positive community atmosphere.

User-4231 joined the conversation with a greeting using emojis and inquired about download options for the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab. Later, User-4231 confirmed finding the information in the group files and expressed gratitude, demonstrating self-sufficiency. Designer-1 shared an image, likely providing visual context for the discussion. They also announced an upcoming update where dry batteries would no longer be ideal components and introduced a student power supply that supports both DC and AC as an ideal component.

Notes: The conversation highlights the participatory design approach, where user feedback is actively sought and considered in the development process. The designers manage user expectations by communicating their priorities and timelines. Gratitude and positive reinforcement from users contribute to a supportive community atmosphere. The use of emojis, images, and detailed explanations enhances communication and engagement within the community. Future analysis should focus on how these interactions influence the overall development of the Physics Lab platform and the emergence of the online community.

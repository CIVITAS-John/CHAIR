You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Did you make categories too large?
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Revise and rewrite the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
I merged categories to streamline the analysis and create more concise themes. The categories were quite specific, so merging them helped in reducing redundancy and creating more comprehensive themes.

I can identify more categories for merging, such as "Collaborative community building" and "Community dynamics" with "Community management" to form a broader category related to community engagement.

The naming of the categories seems accurate and aligned with the research context.

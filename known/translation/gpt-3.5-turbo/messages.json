        "1271123323 2018/03/24 14:51:14\nTolerance | Topic | 785 words\nTolerance is a virtue; tolerance is a realm; tolerance brings two hearts closer; tolerance merges the two poles of the earth. Tolerance is like a blooming flower, fragrant throughout spring; tolerance is like a dense tree, cooling the entire summer; tolerance is like a fiery maple leaf, igniting the whole autumn; tolerance is like a shocking snow, silencing the entire winter. Those who possess tolerance are like having a sea, accommodating countless rivers; those who possess tolerance are like having a sky, embracing numerous birds; those who possess tolerance are like having a desert, surrounding countless grains of sand. Tolerance is something everyone needs to have, it is the magnanimity of a gentleman, a kind of noble generosity. During the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu staged the story of \"Three Qis.\" They agreed that whoever first captured Nanjun would own it. As a result, Zhuge Liang took advantage of Zhou Yu's distraction in thinking about how to attack the city and captured Nanjun when he was unprepared, which was the first Qi. The second Qi is the famous incident: \"Zhou Lang's clever plan secures the world, losing the beauty and the troops.\" He intended to use the beauty trap to keep Liu Bei, but was discovered by Zhuge Liang, who used a stratagem to bring back Liu Bei and his wife, and then openly mocked Zhou Lang at the bow of the ship. The third Qi was because Zhou Lang used the strategy of \"borrowing the road to destroy Guo.\" He wanted to take Jingzhou, but falsely claimed to first take Hanzhong, hoping to capture Liu Bei, but was eventually discovered by Zhuge Liang. In the end, because his schemes were repeatedly exposed by Zhuge Liang, he fell seriously ill and died shortly after, lamenting to the sky, \"If Zhou Yu was born, why was Zhuge Liang born?\" Zhou Yu was ultimately killed by his own schemes, as he lacked a certain breadth of mind, a certain magnanimity. In this world, since no two leaves are alike, there are even fewer identical people. Each person has their own personality, pursuits, habits, strengths, their own way of life, methods of dealing with things, and thinking habits. Therefore, it is normal for some differences to arise between people. As long as we have a tolerant heart, understanding, respecting, and empathizing with others, we can gain a kind of happiness, enjoyment, and contentment. Tolerance is like a high mountain, able to accommodate both flowers and thorns; it can hold towering trees and a delicate blade of grass; tolerance is like a gentle spring rain, able to melt solid ice, awaken dormant love; tolerance is like a rustling autumn wind, able to blow away the clouds of inferiority, and call back the lost conscience. Tolerance is nurturing, understanding, caring, and considerate; tolerance is giving, dedicating, like a crescent moon, like a colorful cloud."

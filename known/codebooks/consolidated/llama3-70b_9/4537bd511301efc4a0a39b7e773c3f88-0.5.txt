You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: highlights improved debugging
Quotes:
- E04: It was really nice that it, like with the troubleshooting errors, for example, like at least in principle, I know that we had this one that we couldn't fix. It seemed like it was able to kind of do some better troubleshooting to a certain extent. (interviewer's observation) Better troubleshooting capability.

2.
Label: e04 appreciates ai driven unit testing and debugging
Quotes:
- E04: It includes debugging, it is actually trying to incorporate like a unit test, which is really cool and really helpful, especially for beginners, because they can kind of, you know, check their inputs. Beginners, everyone really. They can debug their code appropriately. (interviewer's observation) Debugging capability.

3.
Label: chatlogo ability (negative):automation
Quotes:
- E04: I really liked how, like the code that it generates, if you could just kind of place that into the model automatically.  (interviewer's observation) The capability to put into the model automatically.

4.
Label: finds explanation option insufficient
Quotes:
- E04: So, I guess that's kind of annoying because I didn't really want it to explain here, but that was the only option that I had. (interviewer's observation) E04 wants the "fix" option right after the errors are identified.

5.
Label: seeking correct search results
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a neural network" - I want to see if it actually pulls up the model. (interviewer's observation) E04 experiments with the AI to see what phrases could give a correct search result.

6.
Label: acknowledges the challenge of deep specialization in diverse language environments
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the, one of the things which I have observed, as I'm bouncing from like, because I do a lot of different languages and potentially, so I don't have that much time to spend in anyone. (interviewer's observation) As an expert, E01 knows many languages but does not have much time for each one.

7.
Label: abandoning unproductive ai interaction
Quotes:
- E04: So that's interesting anyways, I'm going back to Perceptron. (interviewer's observation) E04 gives up immediately after the AI asks the same question again.

8.
Label: appreciating ai's task understanding
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

9.
Label: inferring user needs
Quotes:
- E01: Well, I cut the entire user's question. It figured out what I wanted. I didn't even tell it what I wanted. It just told me. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could infer E01's need from the input context.

10.
Label: hive feedback system - collect information to minimize miscommunication
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

11.
Label: reflection
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

16.
Label: not just syntax errors
Quotes:
- E01: So I see this from beginners all the time is they, they just get totally lost. I call it lint program from Unix, you know, it's like it's a little green checkbox looks at you and go, okay, wait, it's just, you've spelled everything correctly, but you have a conceptual error here. If it, if it caught structural problems like that, that would, that would help. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo needs to have linting features that exist in other languages (we are working on that right now).

This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done.

Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

24.
Label: time management challenges
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the, one of the things which I have observed, as I'm bouncing from like, because I do a lot of different languages and potentially, so I don't have that much time to spend in anyone. (interviewer's observation) As an expert, E01 knows many languages but does not have much time for each one.

25.
Label: recognizing ai's flexibility

30.
Label: emphasizes polite and descriptive online help seeking practices
Quotes:
- E01: if you approach the user group politely, graciously, and instead of dropping your entire code on it, you go, I narrowed it down to this. I read this documentation. I tried these eight things with this answer and I'm perplexed. If somebody goes, they paste their problem and it's clearly their homework and they want someone else to do it for them. No, I'm not going to help with that. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on proper practices to seek online help: do your own work and clearly describe what you need/tried.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (13 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
13. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: requesting assistance; expressing frustration; seeking technical support
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: asking for clarification; showing interest; inquiring about platform compatibility
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: offering a solution; providing assistance; responding to a request
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: identifying oneself; claiming a profession; establishing credibility
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: In this round of coding, I will focus on describing the actions and interactions within the online community of Physics Lab. I will explore how the designers and users engage with each other, share resources, and negotiate the development process. I will also examine how the community establishes norms and expectations around communication, feedback, and collaboration.

Interpretation phrases for each item:

1. sharing visual content; providing context; setting the tone;
2. seeking technical assistance; expressing frustration; requesting help with avatar upload;
3. inquiring about platform compatibility; seeking clarification; expressing interest;
4. offering a solution; providing technical support; responding to a request;
5. identifying oneself; claiming a profession; establishing credibility;
6. sharing information; providing resources; directing attention to important announcements;
7. soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; fostering collaboration;
8. paying homage; making a request; suggesting features;
9. prioritizing tasks; setting a development roadmap; managing expectations;
10. soliciting feedback; acknowledging limitations; promising future engagement;
11. expressing gratitude; acknowledging effort; showing appreciation;
12. seeking information; inquiring about resources; expressing curiosity;
13. expressing gratitude; acknowledging receipt; confirming understanding;

Summary: The conversation begins with the sharing of an image and a request for technical assistance. The designers and users engage in a discussion about the development process, with users making requests and suggestions for features. The designers respond by providing information, soliciting feedback, and setting expectations for the development roadmap. The tone of the conversation is collaborative and appreciative, with users expressing gratitude for the designers' efforts.

Notes: It appears that the online community of Physics Lab is characterized by a sense of collaboration and mutual respect. The designers are open to feedback and suggestions from users, and the users are appreciative of the designers' efforts. The conversation is focused on the development process and the features of the Physics Lab platform. I hypothesize that this collaborative dynamic will continue to shape the emergence of the online community.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: imagine collaborative learning, envisioning ai-driven learning paths
Relationship: The concepts are related in that participants' imagination of collaborative learning scenarios and AI-driven learning paths are mutually informing, as they envision how AI can support and enhance collaborative learning.
Criteria: Participants imagine AI-supported collaborative learning and tailored learning paths.
Phrase: Envisioning AI-driven collaborative learning.

2.
Concepts: valuing code clarity, emphasizes maintainable code
Relationship: The concepts are related in that participants' valuation of code clarity is driven by their emphasis on maintainable code, as clear code is easier to maintain.
Criteria: Participants prioritize clear and maintainable code.
Phrase: Valuing code maintainability.

3.
Concepts: fixing errors manually, prefers hands-on debugging
Relationship: The concepts are related in that participants' preference for fixing errors manually is a manifestation of their hands-on debugging approach, which involves direct involvement in error correction rather than relying on AI.
Criteria: Participants take a hands-on approach to error fixing and debugging.
Phrase: Preferring manual debugging.

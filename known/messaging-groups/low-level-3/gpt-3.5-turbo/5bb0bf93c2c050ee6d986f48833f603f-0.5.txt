You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---

Preliminary tags: help request
6. P8: Group sharing.
Preliminary tags: community collaboration; group interaction
7. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

Tags for each message:
1. user background; teaching experience; career transition
2. software update announcement; release information; platform availability
3. informal apology; community engagement; humor
4. software download inquiry; technical support
5. help request; user assistance
6. community collaboration; group interaction; knowledge sharing
7. software download instructions; community resources
8. feature request; community input; product development; user feedback
9. non-verbal communication; emoji use
10. non-verbal communication; emoji use

Summary: The conversation includes discussions on user backgrounds, teaching experiences, software updates, community engagement, software download inquiries, help requests, community collaboration, group interactions, feature requests, and non-verbal communication through emojis. The designer actively engages with the community, provides updates on software development, and seeks input for future features, fostering a sense of collaboration and user involvement in the Physics Lab online community.

Notes: The community members show interest in the software updates and actively participate in discussions and inquiries. The designer's responsiveness and willingness to consider user feedback suggest a user-centered approach to software development. The use of emojis adds a touch of informality and expressiveness to the interactions within the community. Further analysis could explore the impact of user engagement on the evolution and sustainability of the Physics Lab online community.

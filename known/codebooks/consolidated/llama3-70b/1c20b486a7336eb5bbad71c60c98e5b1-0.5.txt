You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
2. {Repeat the input 2}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 2}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 2}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 2}

~~~
1. mechanics, component simulation
- Relates to the topic of mechanics in a physics lab context or mentions mechanics experiments.
- Relates to the simulation of components in the physics lab.

2. product updates, update and feature announcements
- Involves the announcement, release, and notification of product updates.
- Announcement of updates or new features in the online community, or refers to announcements or notifications about new features or updates.

Definitions for each code:

1. mechanics, component simulation
Relationship: Inclusive (mechanics includes component simulation)
Criteria: References to mechanical experiments or simulations of components in a physics lab context.
Label: Physics Lab Experiments

2. product updates, update and feature announcements
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts refer to announcements and updates)
Criteria: Mentions or announcements of new or updated features, products, or services in the online community.
Label: Platform Development Announcements

5. 不过不交叉的用右侧的比较好

7. 这版本的电路图仅供测试。。。会可以拖动Editor，因为自动排版算法还不是很稳定，可能会产生比较奇葩的结果
---
8. 感谢大家支持。会做的更好！

Here are the translations:

---
1. Uh... left side or right side
---
2. We're working on this block
---
3. Left side
---
4. Just keep it simple, okay?
---
5. But if it's not intersecting, it's better to use the right side
---
6. So, use both, right?
---
7. This version of the circuit diagram is only for testing... you can drag and drop in the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable, and may produce some weird results
---
8. Thanks for everyone's support. We'll do better!
---
9. Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
---
10. There will be an update. We'll submit to the App Store and release the Android version next Monday, and the Windows version will be released on the weekend

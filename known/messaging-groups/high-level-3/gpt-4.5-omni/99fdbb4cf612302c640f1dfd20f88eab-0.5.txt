You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

* Summary
The conversation involves users and designers of Physics Lab discussing various aspects of the online community, including technical support, updates, and suggestions for improvements. Users are asking questions about the software, expressing gratitude, and sharing their experiences, while designers are providing updates, technical details, and encouraging feedback.

* Plan
To analyze the conversation, we will focus on understanding the interactions between users and designers, the types of support provided, and the ways in which feedback is encouraged and incorporated. We will examine the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to identify key themes such as community engagement, user support, and collaborative development. Guiding questions include: How do users and designers communicate and collaborate? What types of feedback are given and how is it addressed? How do design updates reflect user needs and suggestions?

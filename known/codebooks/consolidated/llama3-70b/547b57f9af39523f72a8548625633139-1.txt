You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: failure, human-ai (negative)
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both describe negative experiences with LLM-driven interfaces, where failure refers to the outcome and human-ai (negative) refers to the nature of the interaction.
Criteria: Participants experiencing or describing instances of failure or conflict with LLM-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Experiencing failures with

2.
Concepts: seeks novice support, potential support for novice
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both describe the participant's perception of the potential of LLM-driven interfaces to support novice users, either by finding features beneficial or suggesting potential benefits.
Criteria: Participants perceiving or suggesting benefits of LLM-driven interfaces for novice users.
Phrase: Seeking support for novices

Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation covers a range of topics related to physics and chemistry, with participants discussing various concepts, equipment, and software. The discussion is primarily focused on the context of high school education and exams, with participants sharing their observations, asking questions, and providing explanations. The conversation also touches on the limitations and challenges faced in the field, as well as the importance of focusing on the exam perspective.
1. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
2. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
3. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
4. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
5. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
6. P11: Hey, good idea.
7. P2: Hehe.
8. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
9. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
10. Designer: The question is,
11. Designer: Where does the light come from?
12. P11: What about light?
13. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
14. P2: Touch it with your hand.
15. P14: I think there's no problem.
16. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
17. P2: And a small light.
18. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
19. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
20. P2: ï¼Ÿ
21. P14: [Image]
22. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
23. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
24. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
25. P1: Let's put up some ads.
26. Designer: Hmm.
27. P14: 
28. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
29. Designer: Oh.
30. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).

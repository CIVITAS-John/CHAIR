Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation revolves around discussions on creating a physics simulation software, with participants sharing knowledge, generating ideas, and considering various features and requirements. There are instances of humor, reactions, and community norm reinforcement. Participants also explore potential monetization strategies for the software.
1. P11: 23333
2. P11: I was just about to say.
3. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
4. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
5. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?
6. P14: It seems a bit troublesome.
7. P2: ……
8. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now.
9. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.
10. Designer: That's true.
11. Designer: Let's just click on ads, hh.
12. P14: Yes, that's fine.
13. P14: 
14. P2: What's wrong with middle schoolers [Emoji]
15. P2: A middle schooler is better than you.
16. P11: I just hope that ads won't take up too much space on the interface.
17. P11: Young man, you misunderstood.
18. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method.
19. P2: Oh.
20. P2: ～
21. Designer: The ads won't be permanent.
22. Designer: We just want you to click on ads to earn points, and then use the points to unlock new content.
23. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come and hit me along the network cable.
24. P2: I know how to code.
25. P11: Okay!
26. P2: [Emoji]
27. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is really annoying.
28. P2: Indeed
29. Designer: The screen isn't big and it's still got psoriasis.
30. P2: It even forces you to click.

Summary: The conversation involves discussions around creating a physics simulation app, with participants sharing knowledge, ideas for features like 3D Touch and avoiding intrusive ads. Payment methods and potential monetization strategies like ads are explored. There are instances of humor, banter, and community norm reinforcement like not tolerating intrusive ads. Some disagreement arises when a participant's age/student status is misunderstood, but it's resolved through clarification.

Notes: 
- Knowledge sharing on coding, UI/UX, monetization models
- Idea generation for features like 3D Touch, avoiding intrusive ads
- Banter and humor help build rapport 
- Some disagreement/misunderstanding resolved through clarification
- Norm of not wanting intrusive ads emerges
- Participants have different roles (designer, coder, etc.) contributing expertise
- Overall, constructive discussion with elements of community building

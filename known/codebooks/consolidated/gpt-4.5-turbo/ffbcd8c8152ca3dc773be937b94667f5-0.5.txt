You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Categories: 
* Social Interaction
* Communication Approach

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Relationship: The sub-codes "humor and playfulness" and "lighthearted engagement" overlap as both involve using a non-serious, enjoyable manner to facilitate interaction.
Criteria: Instances where participants use humor, irony, playful language, or a lighthearted tone to engage, facilitate communication, or build relationships.
Label: Playful Communication
Category: Social Interaction

2.
Relationship: The sub-codes "inquiry and questioning" and "open-ended inquiry" are parallel, but the latter is broader as it specifically involves stimulating discussion, which includes but is not limited to seeking clarification or understanding.
Criteria: Instances where participants ask questions, particularly open-ended ones, to stimulate discussion, seek clarification, or enhance understanding.
Label: Open-Ended Questioning
Category: Communication Approach

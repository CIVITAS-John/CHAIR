You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: uses ai-generated code, request and use ai-generated code
- Participants decide to use AI-generated code, often with minimal modifications.
- Participants request and copy AI-generated code.

2.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: uses ai-generated code, request and use ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are interrelated as participants' requests for AI-generated code lead to their subsequent use of it, often with minimal modifications.
Criteria: Participants decide to utilize AI-generated code, often with minimal modifications, after requesting and copying it.
Phrase: Utilize AI-generated code.

2.
Concepts: discussing error messaging and resolution, advocating for better error management
Relationship: The concepts are causally related as participants' discussions about error messaging lead to their suggestions for improving error management and handling.
Criteria: Participants discuss error messages and their role in understanding and debugging errors, and subsequently advocate for better error management and handling through effective error messaging.
Phrase: Advocate for error management improvement.

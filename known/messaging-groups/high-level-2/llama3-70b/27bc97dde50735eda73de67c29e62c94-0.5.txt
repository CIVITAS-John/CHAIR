Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. Designer: Probably because the teacher finds too much talking annoying ðŸ˜‚
2. P1: hello
3. P4: [Image 1-6]
4. P5: ðŸ˜‚ By the way, I'm here to see if there are any good designs to reference.
5. Designer: Good design?
6. P6: For example, a microcomputer.
7. Designer: Wait for the logic gates.
8. P2: The computer CPU is just logic gates.
9. P5: Hmm.
10. P5: I just need logic gates to make a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
11. P6: [Image 1-14]
12. P6: [Image 1-15]
13. P7: How to play?
14. Designer: Do experiments for fun. ðŸ˜‚
15. P8: Why did you suddenly add a wave?

Here is a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research on how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a humorous comment about a teacher finding too much talking annoying. The conversation then shifts to a discussion about design, with participants sharing images and discussing logic gates, computers, and calculators. The tone remains lighthearted, with the designer encouraging experimentation for fun.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will examine the codes from multiple theoretical angles, including learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. We will explore how the participants' interactions and language use reveal their motivations, goals, and relationships. Guiding questions include: How do participants use humor and playfulness to establish a tone for the conversation? How do they use images and technical terms to communicate and build on each other's ideas? How does the designer facilitate the conversation and encourage experimentation?

# Social Dynamics

Definition: The use of humor, irony, or playful language to establish a tone or build relationships.
- "Probably because the teacher finds too much talking annoying ðŸ˜‚" (1)
- "Do experiments for fun. ðŸ˜‚" (14)
- "ðŸ˜‚ By the way, I'm here to see if there are any good designs to reference." (4)

## Collaboration
Definition: The exchange of ideas, resources, or support among participants.
- "Good design?" (5)
- "For example, a microcomputer." (6)
- "I just need logic gates to make a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft." (10)

# Knowledge Sharing
## Technical Terms
Definition: The use of technical vocabulary or concepts related to physics, computer science, or design.
- "logic gates" (7, 10)
- "microcomputer" (6)
- "computer CPU" (8)

## Resource Sharing
Definition: The sharing of images, links, or other resources to support the conversation.
- "[Image 1-6]" (3)
- "[Image 1-14]" (11)
- "[Image 1-15]" (12)

# Facilitation

11. P2: What's wrong with middle school [Emoji 1-268]
12. P2: Even a middle schooler is better than you
13. P11: Just hope the ads don't take up too much of the experiment interface
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
15. P11: He means he doesn't have a good payment method in middle school
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
19. Designer: Just let you click on ads to earn points, and use points to unlock new content
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can follow the network cable to hit me
21. P2: I can program
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 1-280]
24. Designer: Permanent ad banners on iOS are really disgusting
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen is not big and has psoriasis.
27. P2: And it forces you to click.
28. P2: What are the ads used for @Designer 
29. Designer: Health preservation...
30. Designer: Doing this requires nurturing people...
31. P1: It's not free.
32. Designer: Actually, it's the same as charging money, except you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay.
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do a bit more.
35. Designer: There are some other ways.
36. P8: The points wall is okay.
37. P8: @Designer I think it's okay.
38. P14: I also think it's fine.
39. Designer: Actually, you can learn from that mini program.
40. Designer: Creating, reviewing, and doing questions.
41. P14: How do you say it?
42. P14: [Image 1-299]
43. P17: Brain King.
44. P18: By the way, how to use it?
45. P18: Just downloaded.

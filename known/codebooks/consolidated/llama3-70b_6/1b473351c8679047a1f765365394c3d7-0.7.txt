You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: recognized need for local export
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

2.
Label: validate user suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

3.
Label: tacit disagreement
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

4.
Label: explaining new features
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

5.
Label: list new features and components
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

6.
Label: acknowledged information
Quotes:
- User: Updated
- User: ok

7.
Label: compliment on the 3d effect
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

8.
Label: enhance user experience through support
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

9.
Label: reiterated need
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

10.
Label: clarify limitations of touch screen keyboards
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

11.
Label: designer 1 acknowledges information
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.

12.
Label: reference school development
Quotes:
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

13.
Label: specify educational needs
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

14.
Label: confirmed design element
Quotes:
- User: Left side

15.
Label: shared potential future direction
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

16.
Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

17.
Label: designer 1 aligns with curriculum
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

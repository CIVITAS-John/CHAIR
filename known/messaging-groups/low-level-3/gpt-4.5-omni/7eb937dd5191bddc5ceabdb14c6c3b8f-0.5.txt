You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

Preliminary tags: resource discovery; gratitude; user acknowledgment; self sufficiency; information sharing
4. Designer: [Image 14]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary tags: feature update; technical detail; component realism; user guidance; simulation accuracy
6. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.
Preliminary tags: feature update; technical detail; component functionality; direct current; alternating current; ideal components
7. Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. P4232: How to use the PC version?
9. P4232: [Image 19]
10. P8: It does not support the XP system.

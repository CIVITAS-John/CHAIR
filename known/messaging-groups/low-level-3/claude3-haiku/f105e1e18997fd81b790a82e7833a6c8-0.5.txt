Summary of previous conversation: The conversation started with a user (P13) providing guidance to the community about searching on Baidu. This was acknowledged by another user (P10). The discussion then moved to topics related to the Physics Lab community, such as community participation, discussions about various aspects of the lab (e.g., things in the beaker, astronomy, software), and reactions to shared images. The participants seemed to take on different roles, with some providing guidance, others engaging in discussions, and some reacting to the content. The flow of the conversation suggests an active and engaged community, where users are sharing information, seeking clarification, and responding to each other's contributions.

5. Designer: What's the problem?
6. P4: No problem.
7. P2: What about the moon?
8. P1: The moon is not drawn, right?
9. P14: Maybe it hasn't been done yet.
10. Designer: Last time it was too rushed.
11. P4: The moon is useless.
12. P4: 2333
13. Designer: It depends on the scale.
14. P2: Who said that?
15. P4: universe sandbox
16. Designer: There will be multiple presets.
17. Designer: Because in reality, you encounter many possible questions, many of which are about near-Earth space stations.
18. P11: Yes.
19. Designer: Artificial satellite orbits.
20. Designer: These will involve more.
21. Designer: Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter this normally...
22. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
23. P1: John, have you become more Android?
24. Designer: No, I'll update it today.
25. P17: [Image 126]
26. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
27. Designer: I'll buy a ticket to space.
28. P17: It's the starry sky.
29. P1: Don't imitate it exactly the same.
30. P14: There are also software imitating celestial bodies on Steam.
31. P14: I can't remember if it's 78 or 79.
32. P14: [Image 133]
33. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
34. P11: Look it up online, this is not something that can be solved in a few words. @P2 
35. P2: Can we add a motor? @Designer

Summary: The conversation started with a user (P13) providing guidance to the community about searching on Baidu, which was acknowledged by another user (P10). The discussion then shifted to topics related to the Physics Lab community, such as community participation, discussions about various aspects of the lab (e.g., things in the beaker, astronomy, software), and reactions to shared images. The participants seemed to take on different roles, with some providing guidance, others engaging in discussions, and some reacting to the content.

The conversation then focused more on the technical aspects of the Physics Lab software, with discussions around celestial bodies, software features, and development plans. The participants asked questions, shared information, and provided feedback and suggestions to the Designer, who seemed to be actively engaged in the conversation and responsive to the community's input.

Throughout the conversation, there was a sense of an active and engaged community, where users were collaborating to explore and improve the Physics Lab. The flow of the conversation suggests a community that is interested in the development of the lab and willing to contribute their ideas and feedback.

Notes: The conversation suggests that the Physics Lab community is actively engaged and interested in the development of the software. The participants seem to take on different roles, with some providing guidance, others asking questions, and some sharing information or reactions. The Designer appears to be responsive to the community's input and is actively involved in the conversation, suggesting a collaborative approach to the development of the lab.

The discussion around celestial bodies, software features, and development plans indicates that the community is deeply interested in the technical aspects of the lab and is willing to provide feedback and suggestions to improve it. This level of engagement and collaboration suggests that the community has played a significant role in the emergence and evolution of the Physics Lab.

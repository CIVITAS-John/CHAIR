You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not write repetitive ones.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: feature request
Quotes:
- If there could be an export function, or save and import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set the parameters in the office and import them directly in class.
- If you have any suggestions or needs, feel free to bring them up.
- You can also include mechanics experiments

2.
Label: platform specific updates
Quotes:
- There will be an update. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version next weekend.

Quotes:
- We will also update the multimeter and energized screwdriver this week. If there are any features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group. We will try our best to consider them. Saving experiments to the cloud/local storage, as mentioned before, is also in the plan. Thank you all!
- Suggest adding an exit button function for the PC version, as many regions now use all-in-one touchscreens without a physical keyboard.
- This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to do everything and ends up being inconvenient to use.

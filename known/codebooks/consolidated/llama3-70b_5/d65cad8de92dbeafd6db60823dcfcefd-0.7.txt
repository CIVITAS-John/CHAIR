You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: explaining need for user manual
Quotes:
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

2.
Label: highlights collaborative aspect of the platform
Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

3.
Label: sharing humorous anecdote
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

4.
Label: explaining school infrastructure
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

5.
Label: iterative development process influenced by user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

6.
Label: give a suggestion about taking the development slow
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

7.
Label: expressing acknowledgement
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.
- User: ok

8.
Label: removing idealized components
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

9.
Label: planning a simulated experiment assessment function
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

10.
Label: focusing on electrical section
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

11.
Label: explaining context
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

12.
Label: give response to mitigate the concern
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

13.
Label: and special tips
Quotes:
- Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
More realistic 3D appearance for various meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeter and meter zeroing.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments
Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal/realistic modes.

# Special Tips
The Esc shortcut key will now minimize the window.
The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.

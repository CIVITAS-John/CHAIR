Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. P14: Except me
2. P13: ＋1
3. P15: +1 again
4. P16: ＋1
5. P10: May I ask what "+1" means?
6. P11: It means I feel the same way.
7. P13: +1 means having the same opinion
8. P13: emmmm
9. P13: You can check Baidu

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a statement "Except me" by P14, followed by a series of "+1" responses from other participants. P10 asks for clarification on the meaning of "+1", and P11 and P13 provide explanations. P13 also suggests checking Baidu for more information.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to understand how Physics Lab's online community emerged. Guiding questions include: How do participants use language to negotiate meaning and build consensus? How do they use digital tools to facilitate communication and collaboration? What roles do participants take on in the community, and how do they establish norms and expectations?

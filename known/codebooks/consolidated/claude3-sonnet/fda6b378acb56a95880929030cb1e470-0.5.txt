You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- The merging covers most of the key aspects related to the research question on the emergence of the online community.
- The categories seem reasonably merged without being too broad or narrow.
- The naming is concise and captures the essence of the merged categories.

# Final Merging 
* Software Features & Design
* User Experience
* Educational Context  
* Technical Infrastructure & Implementation
* Development Processes
* Community Dynamics
* Design Process

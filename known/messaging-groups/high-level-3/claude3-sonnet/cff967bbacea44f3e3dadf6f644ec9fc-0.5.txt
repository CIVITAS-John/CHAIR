You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

* Summary
The conversation revolves around updates to the Physics Lab software, compatibility with different operating systems, and user feedback. The designers provide information about new features, ideal components, and compatibility requirements. A user shares their experience using the software on an older system and appreciates its practicality.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from multiple theoretical angles, we can consider the following:

1. Learning Sciences: How does the software design and updates facilitate effective learning experiences for students and teachers? What affordances or constraints might the new features introduce?

2. Human-Computer Interaction: How does the user feedback and interaction with the designers shape the software development process? What usability considerations are being addressed?

3. Participatory Design: To what extent are users involved in the design process? How do the designers respond to user feedback and suggestions?

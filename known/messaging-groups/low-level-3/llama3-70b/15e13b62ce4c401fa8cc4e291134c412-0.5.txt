You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary codes: personal anecdote; technical discussion; design consideration
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary codes: agreement; social norm; community building
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary codes: feature suggestion; user experience; convenience
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary codes: response to feedback; development priority; community engagement
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary codes: technical inquiry; infrastructure; classroom setting
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary codes: technical constraint; infrastructure; classroom setting
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Thoughts: In this conversation, I plan to explore how the designers and users of Physics Lab's online community interact and negotiate the development of the platform. I will analyze the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do designers respond to user feedback? How do users influence the development of Physics Lab? What are the technical and infrastructural constraints that shape the design of Physics Lab?

Codes for each message:

1. Personal anecdote; technical discussion; design consideration
2. Agreement; social norm; community building
3. Feature suggestion; user experience; convenience
4. Response to feedback; development priority; community engagement
5. Technical inquiry; infrastructure; classroom setting
6. Technical constraint; infrastructure; classroom setting; humor
7. Emotional response; humor
8. Design consideration; technical requirement
9. Technical constraint; infrastructure; classroom setting
10. Acknowledgment; active listening
11. User experience; educational setting; positive feedback
12. Inquiry; user profiling
13. User profiling; educational background
14. Development update; versioning; market availability
15. Apology; social norm
16. Information seeking; technical inquiry
17. Politeness; social norm
18. Feature suggestion; collaboration; design consideration

Summary: This conversation between designers and users of Physics Lab reveals a collaborative and engaging online community. Designers respond to user feedback, and users provide suggestions for improving the platform. The conversation highlights technical and infrastructural constraints that shape the design of Physics Lab, such as internet availability in classrooms. The tone of the conversation is friendly and humorous, with designers and users showing appreciation for each other's contributions.

Notes: A key theme emerging from this conversation is the co-design process between designers and users. Designers are responsive to user feedback, and users are invested in the development of Physics Lab. The conversation also highlights the importance of understanding the technical and infrastructural constraints of the educational setting in which Physics Lab will be used.

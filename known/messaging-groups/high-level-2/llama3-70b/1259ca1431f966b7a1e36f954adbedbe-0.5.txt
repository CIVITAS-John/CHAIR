Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a question about pronunciation, followed by an image share, and then a nickname "Brain King" is given. The conversation shifts to discussing a tool or software, with questions about its usage and a shared link. The topic then changes to an update schedule and finally, a technical issue with a fuse is discussed.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to understand how Physics Lab's online community emerged. Guiding questions include: How do community members facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration? What role do shared resources and tools play in the community? How do community members negotiate meaning and provide support?

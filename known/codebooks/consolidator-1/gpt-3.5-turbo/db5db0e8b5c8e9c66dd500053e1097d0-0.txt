Thoughts: Some categories are too broad and could be split into more specific subcategories to capture the nuances of the data. For example, "communication acknowledgment" and "communication clarity" could be divided into different aspects of communication. On the other hand, some categories seem closely related and could be merged to streamline the analysis. "Information seeking" and "research inquiry" might overlap in terms of seeking knowledge or data. The goal is to refine the categories to ensure they are distinct yet comprehensive enough to cover all relevant data points.

Categories to split:
- communication acknowledgment
- communication clarity
- information seeking
- research inquiry

Categories to merge:
- information sharing
- data exchange

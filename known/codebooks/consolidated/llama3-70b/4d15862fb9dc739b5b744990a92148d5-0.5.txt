You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

25.
Label: outlining system requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

26.
Label: promoting iterative refinement
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

27.
Label: discussion of further interests
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

28.

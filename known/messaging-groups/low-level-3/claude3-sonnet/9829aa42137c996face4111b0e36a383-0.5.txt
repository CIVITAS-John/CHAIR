You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, I will look for evidence of learning processes, user interactions with the system, and collaborative design practices. Some guiding questions are: How are participants engaging with the system and each other? What learning opportunities or challenges arise? How are design decisions being negotiated or questioned?

Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. problem framing; design requirements; logic gate; calculator functionality
2. visual communication; image sharing
3. visual communication; image sharing  
4. newcomer inquiry; onboarding; usability
5. designer guidance; playful framing; gamification
6. questioning design choices; critique; participatory design
7. minimal response; uncertainty
8. visual communication; image sharing
9. visual communication; image sharing
10. numerical input; experimenting

Summary: The conversation continues with P5 expressing a need for logic gates to build a calculator, not wanting to use Minecraft. P6 shares two images, potentially demonstrating something. P7 asks how to play, indicating they are new. The designer responds playfully, suggesting conducting experiments. P8 questions the addition of a wave, critiquing the design choices. P7 responds with "Oh", possibly indicating understanding or uncertainty. P2 shares two more images, and P7 inputs the number 66, potentially experimenting with the system.

Notes: There seems to be a mix of participants, some more experienced with the system and others newcomers. The designer is actively guiding users and framing the experience as playful experimentation. Users are sharing visual artifacts, potentially demonstrating their work or findings. There is evidence of participatory design, with users questioning design choices and negotiating functionality. The learning process appears to involve exploration, experimentation, and peer sharing, facilitated by the designer's guidance.

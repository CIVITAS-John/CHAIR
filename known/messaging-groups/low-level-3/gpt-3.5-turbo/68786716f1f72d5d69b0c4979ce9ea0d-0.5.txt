Summary of previous conversation: The conversation continues to delve into technical aspects of physics and chemistry, exploring the challenges of simulation, hardware requirements, and experimental setups. Users actively engage with the designer, suggesting features, discussing pricing models, and sharing feedback on components and functionalities. The community's playful interactions, curiosity-driven inquiries, and practical experimentation shape the ongoing development of the Physics Lab online platform.
1. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
Preliminary tags: financial literacy; payment methods
2. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
Preliminary tags: technological adaptation; feature enhancement
3. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?
Preliminary tags: in app purchases; payment integration
4. P14: It seems a bit troublesome.
5. P2: ……
6. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now.
7. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.
8. Designer: That's true.
9. Designer: Let's just click on ads, hh.
10. P14: Yes, that's fine.
11. P2: What's wrong with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
12. P2: A middle schooler is better than you.
13. P11: I just hope that ads won't take up too much space on the interface.
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood.
15. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method.
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: The ads won't be permanent.
19. Designer: We just want you to click on ads to earn points, and then use the points to unlock new content.
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come and hit me along the network cable.
21. P2: I know how to code.
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 280]
24. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is really annoying.
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen isn't big and it's still got psoriasis.
27. P2: It even forces you to click.
28. P2: What do you need ads for, @Designer 
29. Designer: Health...
30. Designer: Doing this requires hiring people...
31. P1: It's free.
32. Designer: Actually, it's similar to charging money, but if you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay...
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do more of it.
35. Designer: There are some other ways as well.

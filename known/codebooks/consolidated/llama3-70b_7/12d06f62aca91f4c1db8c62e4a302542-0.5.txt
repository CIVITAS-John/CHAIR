You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: has only used chat gpt 3.5
Quotes:
- E04: I don't know if I've ever tried 4. I guess it would be 3.5. (interviewer's observation) Only used ChatGPT 3.5 before

2.
Label: finds ai responses inconsistent
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

3.
Label: finds error messages misleading
Quotes:
- E04: maybe you saw something that I didn't, but from my perspective, it seemed as though the code was set up appropriately, but it was marking the syntax as wrong. So maybe I was missing something, but I didn't see anything missing. So that was kind of frustrating. (interviewer's observation) Shows error messages even when it seems to be correct (that's a bug identified)

4.
Label: describes typical ai conversation
Quotes:
- E01: This is what conversations with ChatGPT typically look like. I had to go through about eight separate times to get all the errors out of it.  But, but look at how it structured the code. Look at the things that did look what you could learn from this. This is valuable. (interviewer's observation) Users may benefit from the iterative debugging process during working with AI, even though AI might give wrong answers.

5.
Label: finds ai helpful for syntax
Quotes:
- E04: Because I'll like forget the syntax sometimes and I usually use the netlogo dictionary and just have it like open to the side. (interviewer's observation) E04 still forgets about the syntax and ChatGPT can help.

6.
Label: prefers hands on debugging
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E04 manually tries to fix the errors in the AI-generated code and did not choose "explain it".

7.
Label: easy to maintain code
Quotes:
- E01: You know, so in point of fact, I considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can. So that when I come back to it later, I could figure out why it, why it's not working anymore. (interviewer's observation) Discussion on code complexity & quality. Plain / not-tricky code's advantage in maintenance.

8.
Label: compares to early apple maps
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

9.
Label: ai ability (negative): error
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

10.
Label: suggests system support
Quotes:
- E01: Depending on what you do and how busy you are and the higher ranking people are, the more busy they are, the longer it is between sessions. So you make some notes on little yellow, sticky cinnamon. And then you go back to your administrator job for two months, and then some other project comes up. And then six months later, you come back. Okay, now, where was I? (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on how professionals learn - they learn in fragments, in fragmented time blocks and need support from the system to remind them where they were.

11.
Label: e04 expects ai to find specific net logo models
Quotes:
- E04: I know that Perceptron model exists in the NetLogo model library. So it's interesting to me that it didn't pull that up, but it could be that I used like the wrong verbiage, but it doesn't understand what I'm trying to do. (interviewer's observation) E04 expects ChatLogo to find "Perceptron" model from the library but it does not. He evaluates the search results of the AI.

12.
Label: values immediate feedback from ai for model development
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

Quotes:
- E04: Like in this type of, like, like I was saying with this window, for example, where it's giving you the options and basically there was that one time where the only option was for it to explain itself.  Which makes sense, but it'd be nice if I could just kind of like forego that and just keep doing, you know, But you know, for someone that's probably not as useful for someone who's like still learning, but like, I guess for someone who's more experienced, it's nice to be able to just like skip over things that you already know. (interviewer's observation) Options too limited; tension between a novice-oriented/expert-oriented design.

16.
Label: feels frustrated with false errors
Quotes:
- E04: maybe you saw something that I didn't, but from my perspective, it seemed as though the code was set up appropriately, but it was marking the syntax as wrong.

23.
Label: expresses frustration with current documentation
Quotes:
- E01: I cannot learn like that. I'm sorry. I am not a top left first page to last page. So if AI can help find a good place to start and manage that learning process, then I think that's astounding. (interviewer's observation) Critique on the existing situation of technical documentation and imagine that AI could improve the learning process.

24.
Label: struggling with multiple errors

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: evaluating ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve participants examining and assessing AI-generated code, but with varying levels of scrutiny and intention.
Criteria: Participants evaluate and critique AI-generated code, selectively copying relevant parts into their model.
Phrase: Critique AI-generated code

2.
Concepts: seeking additional ai guidance
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve participants requesting additional support or direction from AI, but with varying levels of specificity and detail.
Criteria: Participants seek AI assistance for coding tasks, making detailed requests.
Phrase: Request AI guidance

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: reflects on collaborative coding practices
Quotes:
- E01: What if you were just sitting in a peer programming and sitting next to a, uh, a bright person who was helping you, what would you want them to do? So you might start writing a line of code and they would stop and go, why are you, why are you typing? (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how AI could potentially serve as a pair programmer that questions the learners' motives.

2.
Label: showing thoughtful decision making in ai interaction
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 reads error messages before making a choice.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Criteria: The participant describes or demonstrates how an LLM-driven interface could facilitate collaborative learning or coding practices, such as peer programming or questioning motives.
Label: Envisions AI-assisted collaborative coding

2.
Criteria: The participant exhibits careful consideration or deliberation when interacting with an LLM-driven interface, such as reading error messages before making a decision.
Label: Cautious AI interaction

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: share positive user feedback
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

2.
Label: reciprocate greeting
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

3.
Label: addressed component functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

4.
Label: highlight innovative design
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

5.
Label: inquire about user's background
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

6.
Label: confirm upcoming update
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

7.
Label: designer 1 manages expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

8.
Label: emphasize practical utility
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

9.
Label: acknowledged interaction limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

10.
Label: foster community engagement
Quotes:

- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?

17.
Label: facilitate access to software
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

19.
Label: engage with community for support
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

- User: How to download?

20.

22.
Label: user 4232 considers educational context
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

23.
Label: explained future feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

24.
Label: share personal experience to illustrate a workaround
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

25.
Label: suggested features for optical experiments
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

26.
Label: provide context for userâ€™s software interaction
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

27.
Label: facilitate information dissemination

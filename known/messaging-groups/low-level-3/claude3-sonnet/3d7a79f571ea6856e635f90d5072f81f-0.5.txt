You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
9. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
Preliminary tags: user request; feature suggestion; wave simulations; optics simulations
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
Preliminary tags: developer response; prioritization; electricity and magnetism
3. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: developer response; gathering feedback; mechanics
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: user appreciation; encouragement
5. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
Preliminary tags: user question; software download; platform
6. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
Preliminary tags: user update; found information
7. Designer: [Image 14]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: The conversation seems to revolve around feature requests and development plans for Physics Lab. Some key points:
- User P4230 requests wave and optics simulations 
- The designer prioritizes completing electricity and magnetism sections first
- User P4231 asks about downloading Physics Lab for PC/whiteboard
- The designer shares an image, likely related to the upcoming update
- The designer mentions changes to battery simulation and introducing an ideal power supply component

To analyze this from different angles, I could look at:
- User needs/requests and how they are addressed by the designer
- Development priorities and decision-making process
- Information sharing about new features/updates
- User experience with downloading/accessing the software

Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. user request; feature suggestion; wave simulations; optics simulations
2. developer response; prioritization; electricity and magnetism  
3. developer response; gathering feedback; mechanics
4. user appreciation; encouragement
5. user question; software download; platform
6. user update; found information  
7. update preview; visual aid
8. update announcement; battery simulation; internal resistance
9. update announcement; power supply; AC/DC; ideal component

Summary: The conversation revolves around user feature requests for Physics Lab, specifically for wave and optics simulations. The designer responds by indicating that electricity and magnetism sections are the current priority, but will gather more feedback before starting mechanics. Another user asks about downloading Physics Lab for PC/whiteboard and finds the files. The designer then shares an image preview of an upcoming update, which will change battery simulation by allowing removal of internal resistance, and introduce an ideal power supply component supporting AC/DC.

Notes: 
- Physics Lab seems to be actively developed software for physics education/simulations
- User feedback and requests are considered in development prioritization
- Transparent communication about upcoming changes/features from the designer
- Cross-platform accessibility (PC, whiteboard) is a concern for users
- Hypothesis: The online community emerged to gather user feedback, share development updates, and provide support/resources for using Physics Lab.

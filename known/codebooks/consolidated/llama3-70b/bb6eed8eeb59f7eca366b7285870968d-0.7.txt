You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: announces changes to simulation features
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

2.
Label: suggesting improvements for wave mechanics
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

3.
Label: proposing specific physics simulation and demonstration features
Quotes:

- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

5.
Label: politely requests assistance
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

6.
Label: plans to incorporate the suggested exit button function in the next update
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

7.
Label: advocating for user convenience
Quotes:

8.
Label: updating software version
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

9.
Label: promoting group sharing
Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

10.
Label: sharing environmental constraints
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

11.
Label: planning future updates
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

12.
Label: but not too old
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

13.
Label: user satisifcation
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

14.
Label: fostering community trust
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

15.
Label: suggest educational enhancements
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference?

16.
Label: provide conditional advice
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

17.
Label: the designers are considering a wide range of use cases and hardware environments
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

18.
Label: inquiring about the possibility of including mechanics experiments
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

19.
Label: shares institutional context
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

20.
Label: confirm future feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

21.
Label: inform about touch screens
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

22.
Label: considers multiple perspectives
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

23.
Label: demonstrates technical expertise
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

24.
Label: contextualizing response
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Create multiple interpretations for both the interviewee's verbal response and the interviewer's observations. Take note of emotions explicitly or implicitly expressed by the interviewee. Code through the lens of human-computer interaction and learning sciences.

Always follow the output format:
===
Thought: {What is the most common theme among the input quotes? Do not over-interpret the data.}
Phrase: {A single verb phrase that faithfully describes the topic}
===
~~~
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 dictated each of the parameter fields.
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 reads error messages before making a choice.
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 chooses to fix the problem rather than showing the explanation.
Keywords: e01, interviewer, verbal, response, observation

===
Thought: The most common theme among the input quotes is E01's engagement with the LLM-driven interface, specifically their interaction with parameter fields, error messages, and problem-solving.
Phrase: "E01 actively engages with LLM-driven interface"
===

===
Thought: Another theme is E01's preference for independent problem-solving over seeking explanations, indicating a proactive learning approach.
Phrase: "E01 prefers independent problem-solving over seeking explanations"
===

===
Thought: The lack of verbal response suggests E01's focus and immersion in the task, indicating a level of comfort and familiarity with the LLM-driven interface.
Phrase: "E01 exhibits focus and immersion in task with LLM-driven interface"
===

===
Thought: E01's behavior of reading error messages before making a choice suggests a careful and thoughtful approach to using the LLM-driven interface.
Phrase: "E01 demonstrates careful and thoughtful approach to LLM-driven interface"
===

===
Thought: The interviewer's observations provide insight into E01's non-verbal communication and actions, which are indicative of their perceptions and usage of the LLM-driven interface.
Phrase: "Interviewer's observations reveal E01's non-verbal communication and actions with LLM-driven interface"

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (19 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

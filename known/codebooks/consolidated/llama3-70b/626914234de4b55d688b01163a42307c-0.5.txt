You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

13.
Label: seeks specific features for demonstrations
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

14.

18.
Label: considers incorporating both left and right sides based on user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

19.
Label: striving for design perfection
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

20.
Label: acknowledging that the on screen keyboard may not be accessible without touching the input field
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

21.
Label: teacher response
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- User: Left side

22.
Label: user satisifcation
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

27.
Label: announcement of plans
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

28.
Label: aligns with community interests
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

29.
Label: access
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

30.
Label: clarifying compatibility issues
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

31.
Label: discusses the limitations in exploring other directions for free experiments
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

32.
Label: designer 1 explains feature importance
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

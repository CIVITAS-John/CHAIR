You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.

~~~
1. developer responsiveness, developer responses (dr).
- Examples of developers responding to community feedback
- Responses from the designer/developer addressing community needs, explaining plans, or providing updates.

2. product updates, technical updates.
- Announcing updates or releases of Physics Lab products or features
- Information shared about technical updates, changes, or features being added to the Physics Lab.

3. technical discussion, technical challenges and solutions.
- Comments reflecting technical aspects or challenges
- Discussions that highlight specific technical issues or developmental challenges faced by the team, along with their approaches or solutions to these problems.

4. software updates and roadmap.
- Discussing or sharing updates about the software development process
- Mentions of software updates, new features, or changes

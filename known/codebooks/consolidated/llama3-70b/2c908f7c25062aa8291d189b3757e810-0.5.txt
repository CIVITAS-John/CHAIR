You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: user need inquiries, asking follow-up questions on needs
- A designer asks about user needs or requirements to understand their needs.
- Designer asks follow-up questions to clarify user needs.

2.
Concepts: ask a question, clarification requests
- User or designer asks a question, often seeking clarification or information.
- A user or designer asks for additional information or clarification on a topic.

3.
Concepts: user support requests, technical guidance requests
- A user seeks guidance or support on using a feature or software.
- A user seeks guidance or instructions on how to use the software.

4.
Concepts: feature requests
- A user requests specific features or functionality from the software.
- A user suggests a new feature or functionality for the Physics Lab software.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: user need inquiries, asking follow-up questions on needs
Relationship: Inclusion (asking follow-up questions is a part of understanding user needs)
Criteria: Designer asks about user needs and clarifies them through follow-up questions
Label: User Needs Exploration

2.
Concepts: ask a question, clarification requests
Relationship: Parallel (asking a question and seeking clarification are two separate concepts)
Criteria: User or designer asks a question or seeks clarification on a topic
Label: Information Seeking

3.
Concepts: user support requests, technical guidance requests
Relationship: Inclusion (technical guidance is a type of support)
Criteria: User seeks guidance or support on using a feature or software
Label: Technical Assistance

4.
Concepts: feature requests
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: User suggests or requests new features or functionality for the software
Label: Feature Suggestions

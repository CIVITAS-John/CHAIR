You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (7 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: non-committal response, expressing implicit rejection
Relationship: Inclusion (non-committal response is a way of expressing implicit rejection)
Criteria: Designer responds vaguely or indirectly rejects a user's suggestion or request without explicitly saying no.
Label: Avoiding Commitment

2.
Concepts: justified feedback, providing justifications
Relationship: Parallel (justified feedback and providing justifications are two aspects of the same concept)
Criteria: Users provide explanations or reasons for their feedback, suggestions, or requests.
Label: Justified Input

3.
Concepts: providing elaborated responses, clarifying questions and requests
Relationship: Inclusion (providing elaborated responses is a way of clarifying questions and requests)
Criteria: Users or designers provide additional information to clarify previous answers or responses.
Label: Clarification

4.
Concepts: approval and agreement, confirmation and agreement
Relationship: Parallel (approval and agreement, and confirmation and agreement are two aspects of the same concept)
Criteria: Users or designers express agreement or approval with an idea or suggestion.
Label: Agreement

5.
Concepts: focus area alignment, consensus and understanding
Relationship: Intersection (focus area alignment requires consensus and understanding)
Criteria: Designer explains the focus areas or priorities of the project, and users agree with or support a focus area or idea.
Label: Shared Understanding

6.

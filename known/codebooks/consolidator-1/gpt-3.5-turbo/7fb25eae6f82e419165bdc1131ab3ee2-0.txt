You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other.
First, identify some potential categories for all codes in short phrases.
Then, write short, clear, generalizable criteria without unnecessary specifics or examples. Refine the label if necessary. Group each code into a category.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Potential categories:
a. {Category A}
b. {Category B}
...

Definitions for each code (32 in total):
1. 
Label: {Label 1}
Criteria: {Criteria of code 1}
Category: {The category of code 1}

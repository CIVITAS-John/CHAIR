You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: In this round of open coding, I will focus on identifying the events, contexts, and intents behind each message. I will consider how the designers communicate with the community, manage expectations, and provide updates. Additionally, I will look for evidence of participatory design elements, such as user feedback influencing development, and how the community engages with the development process. Key guiding questions include: How do designers manage communication and expectations? How do users interact and provide feedback? What are the indicators of community emergence and participatory design?

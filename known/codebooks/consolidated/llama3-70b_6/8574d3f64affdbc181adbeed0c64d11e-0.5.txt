You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: consider local export functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

2.
Label: offering support for different platforms
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

3.
Label: suggesting educational content
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

4.
Label: explanation
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

5.
Label: updating on the status of the update in the apple market
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

6.

Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

8.
Label: addressing educational needs
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

9.
Label: seek usage instructions
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

10.
Label: from older xp systems to modern touch screen devices
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

11.
Label: appreciation of feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

12.
Label: encouraging participation
Quotes:
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

13.
Label: there's a mix of experienced and new users
Quotes:

- Designer: Okay.

16.
Label: pays homage to experts
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

17.
Label: explaining use case scenario
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

18.
Label: recognizing limitation in previous statement
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

19.
Label: share update timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

20.
Label: confirms upcoming addition of requested features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

21.
Label: validate user request
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

22.
Label: acknowledge help
Quotes:
- User: Thank you.

23.
Label: removing idealized components
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

24.
Label: align with user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

25.
Label: describing touch screen limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

26.
Label: describes the bidirectional diagram connections
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

27.
Label: express hope for compatibility
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

28.
Label: build rapport
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]
- Designer: Hello :)

29.
Label: acknowledging the workaround
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

30.
Label: explain current focus
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

31.
Label: user friendly design in educational contexts
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

32.
Label: maintaining communication
Quotes:
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group

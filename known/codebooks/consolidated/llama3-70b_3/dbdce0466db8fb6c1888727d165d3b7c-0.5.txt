You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

2.
Label: consider hardware limitations

- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation
- Designer: We are working on this part

29.
Label: setting realistic timelines
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

30.
Label: providing context for software use
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

31.
Label: development goals
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

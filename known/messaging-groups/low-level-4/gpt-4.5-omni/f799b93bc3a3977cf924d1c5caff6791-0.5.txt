You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: acknowledging expertise; making detailed feature request; suggesting specific educational tools; engaging in participatory design
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: outlining development priorities; indicating future plans; managing user expectations
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: planning to gather feedback; organizing workflow; ensuring user contributions are remembered
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: expressing gratitude; acknowledging designers' efforts
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: using emoji to greet; asking for download information; engaging with community
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: confirming resource location; expressing gratitude; indicating successful resource access
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: When analyzing this conversation, it is important to consider how users and designers interact to shape the development of Physics Lab. The messages reflect a participatory design process where users contribute ideas, and designers manage expectations and provide updates. Key questions include: How do users' requests influence the development priorities? How do designers balance user feedback with their development roadmap? How does the community's interaction reflect principles of learning sciences and human-computer interaction?

Interpretations for each message:
1. acknowledging expertise; making detailed feature request; suggesting specific educational tools; engaging in participatory design
2. outlining development priorities; indicating future plans; managing user expectations
3. planning to gather feedback; organizing workflow; ensuring user contributions are remembered
4. expressing gratitude; acknowledging designers' efforts
5. using emoji to greet; asking for download information; engaging with community
6. confirming resource location; expressing gratitude; indicating successful resource access
7. sharing visual content; providing update information; enhancing user understanding
8. updating component functionality; informing users of changes; improving simulation accuracy
9. introducing new component features; explaining functionality; enhancing user experience

Summary: The conversation begins with a user acknowledging the expertise of the designers and making a detailed request for specific features related to mechanical waves and optical experiments. The designer responds by outlining their development priorities, focusing on completing the electrical section before moving on to other areas. The designer also mentions the plan to gather more user feedback before starting on mechanics to ensure all contributions are remembered. Another user joins the conversation, greeting the community with emojis and asking for download information, which they find in the group files. The designer shares an image and updates on the functionality of components, indicating that dry batteries will no longer be ideal components and introducing a new student power supply that supports both DC and AC.

Notes: The conversation highlights the participatory design process, where users actively contribute ideas and designers manage the development roadmap. The interaction reflects principles of learning sciences by focusing on educational tools and simulations. The use of emojis and gratitude expressions fosters a positive community atmosphere. The designers' updates on component functionality demonstrate a commitment to improving the accuracy and usability of the simulations.

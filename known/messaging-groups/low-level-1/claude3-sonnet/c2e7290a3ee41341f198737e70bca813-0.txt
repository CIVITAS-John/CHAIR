1. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
2. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
3. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits. So I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know. So please enlighten me in the future if I don't understand. Thank you.
4. P4: Have you updated it?
5. P11: It's not ideal...
6. P11: I will consider the impedance.
7. P11: Hmm, I just updated to the latest version.
8. P11: Thank you.
9. P12: My sister just found a chat group where the group owner has gone crazy and keeps sending out red packets. The group code is 695176754, everyone hurry and grab them.
10. P5: ã€‚

Summary: The conversation starts with a technical discussion about circuits and electronics, with some participants asking for help and expressing gratitude. However, there are also off-topic messages advertising a chat group and an unclear message.

Notes: The conversation shows a mix of technical discussions and social interactions within the community. While some participants are engaged in the technical topic, others seem to be distracted or trying to promote unrelated content. This highlights the need for moderation and guidelines to keep the discussions focused and on-topic.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
2. {Repeat the input 2}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 2}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 2}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 2}

~~~
1. feedback encouragement, call for feedback
- Requests user input or feedback for future development
- Refers to explicit calls or invitations for users to provide feedback, suggestions, or requirements for the software

2. technical inquiry, technical issues
- Questions or issues related to using Physics Lab, including technical difficulties.
- Reports or discussions about technical difficulties, errors, or limitations encountered while using Physics Lab

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1. feedback encouragement, call for feedback
Relationship: The concepts are parallel, referring to the solicitation of user input for improvement and the actual provision of feedback.
Criteria: Instances where users or developers explicitly request or provide feedback for future development or improvement of Physics Lab.
Label: Soliciting User Feedback

2. technical inquiry, technical issues
Relationship: The concepts are inclusive, with technical inquiry being a broader category that encompasses technical issues.
Criteria: Instances where users report, discuss, or inquire about technical difficulties, errors, or limitations encountered while using Physics Lab.
Label: Technical Support and Troubleshooting

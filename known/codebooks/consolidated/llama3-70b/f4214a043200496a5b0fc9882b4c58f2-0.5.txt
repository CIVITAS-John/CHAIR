You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
	+ Yes, categories 1, 26, and 27 could be merged into "Community Building and Interaction".
	+ Categories 13 and 22 could be merged into "User Experience and HCI".
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
	+ No, the merged categories seem to be well-defined and concise.
- Is any naming inaccurate?
	+ No, the names of the merged categories seem to accurately reflect the combined aspects.

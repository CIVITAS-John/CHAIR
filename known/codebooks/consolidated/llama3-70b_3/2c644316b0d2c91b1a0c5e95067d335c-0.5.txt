You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: directed users to group files
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

2.
Label: designer 1 outlines focus areas

3.
Label: user satisifcation
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

4.

Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

8.
Label: "long-term stability"
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

15.
Label: seek consensus
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

16.
Label: designer 1 theorizes about compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

17.
Label: share positive feedback
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

19.
Label: showed interest in platform access
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

20.
Label: explain lack of internet
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

21.
Label: align with educational needs
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

22.
Label: designer 1 maintains engagement
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.
- Designer: Hello :)
- Designer: Hmm.

23.
Label: appreciate effort
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

24.
Label: maintain polite communication
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

25.

Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

26.
Label: offer ongoing support
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

27.
Label: announce component update
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

28.
Label: provide alternative solution
Quotes:
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout
- User: Win7 should be fine.

29.
Label: designer 1 communicates project timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

30.
Label: requested feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

31.
Label: gather context
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

32.
Label: user 4232 highlights practicality
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

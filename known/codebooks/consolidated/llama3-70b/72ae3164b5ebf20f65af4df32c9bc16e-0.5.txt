You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

5.
Label: requesting circuit diagram drawing functionality and grid hiding option for creating exam materials
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

6.
Label: noting lack of good existing tools
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

7.

Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

16.
Label: acknowledging advice
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm.

17.
Label: with potential for high school demo experiments based on needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

18.
Label: agreeing with focus
Quotes:
- User: Indeed

19.
Label: indicating potential for future chemistry component
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

21.
Label: confirming intersection style
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

22.
Label: confirming common old intersection style
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

23.
Label: considering specific use cases and usability
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

24.
Label: inquiring about visual representation conventions used in current textbooks
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

19.
Label: demonstrating openness to user input
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

20.
Label: suggests using the right side for non crossing in circuit diagrams
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

23.
Label: validating designer's experience
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

24.
Label: positively evaluating the simulated experiment assessment idea
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

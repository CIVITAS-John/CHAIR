You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

2.
Label: highlight practical use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

3.
Label: provide progress report
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

4.
Label: announce component change
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

5.
Label: explanation of upcoming features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

15.
Label: speculate on compatibility timeframe
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

16.
Label: show commitment to user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

17.
Label: question about the request
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

18.
Label: outline future possibilities
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

19.
Label: assure manual editing
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

20.
Label: announce resource availability
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

21.
Label: design question
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

22.
Label: teacher
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
- User: Yes.

23.
Label: give further information about the convesation
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

24.
Label: describe update scope
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

25.
Label: open to alternatives
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

26.
Label: suggest new educational content
Quotes:

27.
Label: inquire about android update status
Quotes:
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?

28.
Label: community response
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

29.
Label: clarify version details
Quotes:
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary tags: user dissatisfaction; user experience; guidance seeking
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary tags: technology preference; platform specific features
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary tags: user inquiry; user role clarification; educational context
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary tags: user profession; educational engagement
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: In analyzing these interactions, consider the users' engagement with the platform, their preferences and needs, as well as the designers' responses and strategies. Look at how educational contexts influence feature requests and development priorities. Also, explore the dynamics of user dissatisfaction and guidance-seeking behavior in the context of participatory design. Consider the role of image sharing in community building and user interactions.

Tags for each message:
1. Image sharing; community building
2. User dissatisfaction; user experience; guidance seeking
3. Technology preference; platform specific features
4. User inquiry; user role clarification; educational context
5. User profession; educational engagement
6. Platform announcement; community engagement
7. User feedback solicitation
8. User feature request; educational content specificity
9. Feature prioritization; development planning
10. User feedback incorporation
11. User appreciation; community support
12. Information seeking; platform download
13. User engagement; platform exploration

Summary: The conversation revolves around user interactions, feature requests, and platform engagement within the Physics Lab online community. Designers seek feedback and prioritize development based on user input, particularly focusing on educational content. Users express their needs and preferences, contributing to the participatory design process.

Notes: The users' active engagement with the platform and the designers' responsiveness indicate a collaborative approach to platform development. Educational contexts play a significant role in shaping the features and content priorities within the community. User feedback and feature requests are key drivers of platform evolution in Physics Lab.

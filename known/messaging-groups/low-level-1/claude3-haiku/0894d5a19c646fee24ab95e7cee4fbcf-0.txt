1. Designer: I tried it in junior high last time. Now there is a clever way to click on the link button in the upper right corner, pop up the browser, and it won't be full screen anymore... = =
2. P4232: @Designer Yes, that's right.
3. P4232: It would be convenient to have an export function, or save and import experiments. We can set the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
4. Designer: It will be available.
5. Designer: Is there a network in the classroom?
6. P4232: Generally not, since one time during a city-level public class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
7. Designer: 2333333333
8. Designer: Looks like we need to support local export now.
9. P4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid software downloads that may slow down the computers.
10. Designer: Mm-hmm.
11. P4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were all amazed.
12. Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. P4232: I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available on the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
15. Designer: Sorry for the midnight crowing :)
16. P4233: How to download?
17. P4233: May I ask?
18. P8: Group sharing.

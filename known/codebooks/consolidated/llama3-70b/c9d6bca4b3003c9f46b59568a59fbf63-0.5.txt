You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: provide timeline for availability
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

2.
Label: user 4235 requests mechanics experiments
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

3.
Label: sharing info about old computer systems in school
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

4.
Label: consider technical requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

5.
Label: state lack of classroom internet
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

6.
Label: prioritizing tasks
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

7.
Label: engaging with the community for assistance
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

8.
Label: request export/import function for experiments
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

9.
Label: considering user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

10.
Label: invite user participation
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

11.
Label: share extensive teaching experience

- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

12.
Label: set expectations based on hardware age
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

13.
Label: tacit disagreement
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

14.
Label: informing users that the new version has been shared in the group
Quotes:
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group

15.
Label: designer 1 provides special tips

17.
Label: appreciation of feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

18.
Label: prioritizing electromagnetism
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

19.
Label: user 4230 acknowledges hard work
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

20.
Label: connecting to community
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

21.
Label: designer 1 maintains transparency
Quotes:
- Designer: We are working on this part

22.
Label: with users sharing experiences and providing feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

23.
Label: share potential future direction
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

24.

Label: offering guidance
Quotes:
- User: Left side

27.
Label: ask a question about the app
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

28.
Label: advises manual adjustments due to auto layout algorithm instability
Quotes:

29.
Label: the designers are focusing on both immediate improvements and long term stability
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

30.
Label: inquiring about current textbook practices

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. P13: From freshman year in high school.
Preliminary tags: freshman year; high school experience; age diversity
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
Preliminary tags: mosfet; electronics; specialized knowledge
3. P2: @Designer 
Preliminary tags: @mention; question; seeking clarification
4. P17: [Image 198]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used with test tubes?
Preliminary tags: potassium permanganate; chemistry; interdisciplinary connection
6. P2: +1
Preliminary tags: agreement; validation; community building
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 202]
9. P14: How do you say?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Will the condensed liquid not flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year...
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
20. P1: There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was good.
22. Designer: But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
23. Designer: So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be on electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
32. P1: If you can create a comprehensive and free software, it should be very popular.

Summary: This conversation revolves around the participants' shared interest in physics and chemistry. They discuss various topics, including MOSFETs, potassium permanganate, and test tubes, showcasing their diverse backgrounds and expertise. The Designer plays a crucial role in facilitating the conversation, providing insights and clarifications. The participants engage in active questioning, seeking clarification, and sharing knowledge. The conversation is characterized by a sense of community, with participants validating and agreeing with each other.

Notes: I notice that the conversation is quite technical, with participants drawing on their prior knowledge and expertise. The Designer's presence helps to guide the conversation and provide clarification. I'm intrigued by the participants' willingness to ask questions and seek clarification, indicating a sense of safety and trust within the community. I'm also struck by the humor and lighthearted tone that permeates the conversation. As I continue analyzing the conversation, I'll explore how these dynamics contribute to the emergence of the Physics Lab online community.

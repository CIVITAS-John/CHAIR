You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: recognize novice programming challenges, highlight novice help-seeking challenges
Relationship: Both concepts focus on the identification of obstacles faced by novices, with one emphasizing programming challenges and the other focusing on the difficulties in seeking assistance.
Criteria: Interviewees identify and highlight the challenges and inefficiencies encountered by novices in programming contexts and when seeking help due to unstructured code submissions.
Phrase: Identify and highlight novice programming and help-seeking challenges.

2. 
Concepts: addressing novice challenges, identify beginner learning needs
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both focus on understanding and responding to the needs of beginners in programming, with one addressing specific challenges and the other identifying foundational learning requirements.
Criteria: Users address the challenges faced by novices in debugging and conceptualizing programming tasks while identifying the foundational learning needs for beginners.
Phrase: Address novice challenges and identify beginner learning needs.

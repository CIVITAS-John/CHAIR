You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: novice (negative), novice's challenge of asking the right question
- Discusses the limitations of novices in conceptualizing problems for effective AI use.
- Reflects on the challenges novices face in formulating effective questions for AI assistance.

2.
Concepts: task initiation, propose coding tasks
- Interviewees initiate coding tasks by requesting specific programs from the AI, demonstrating their engagement with the tool.
- Interviewees express a desire for AI to assist in generating specific types of code and request the creation of visual patterns.

3.
Concepts: proposes alternative ai, suggest improvements to ai
- Users suggest alternative approaches or prompts to the AI for generating desired outputs.
- Users propose improvements for AI and request specific input to implement ideas or modifications in their code.

4.
Concepts: appreciate ai's support, appreciates clear explanations from ai
- Users appreciate AI's ability to assist with documentation and clarify error messages.
- Users evaluate the clarity of AI explanations and appreciate their accessibility.

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. 
Concepts: novice (negative), novice's challenge of asking the right question
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both highlight the difficulties faced by novices in effectively utilizing AI due to their inexperience and inability to articulate their needs.
Criteria: Novices struggle to conceptualize problems and formulate effective questions for AI assistance, limiting their ability to leverage the technology.
Phrase: Struggle to articulate effective questions.

2. 
Concepts: task initiation, propose coding tasks
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as initiating tasks involves actively engaging with the AI to request specific coding assistance.
Criteria: Interviewees engage with the AI by initiating coding tasks and requesting the generation of specific programs or visual patterns.
Phrase: Initiate coding tasks with AI.

3. 
Concepts: proposes alternative ai, suggest improvements to ai
Relationship: The concepts are related as both involve users actively engaging with the AI to enhance its functionality and outputs through suggestions and modifications.
Criteria: Users suggest alternative approaches and improvements to the AI, seeking to refine its outputs and better meet their coding needs.
Phrase: Suggest improvements to AI.

4. 
Concepts: appreciate ai's support, appreciates clear explanations from ai
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as they both reflect users' positive perceptions of AI's role in providing assistance and clarity in their coding efforts.
Criteria: Users value AI's support in documentation and clarity of explanations, enhancing their understanding and usability of the tool.
Phrase: Value AI's supportive clarity.

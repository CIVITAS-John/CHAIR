You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: adapting to ai responses and refining requests, adapting to ai interaction and refining communication styles
Relationship: The two concepts are interconnected, as adapting to AI responses leads to refining requests, and adapting to AI interaction leads to refining communication styles.
Criteria: Participants adapt to AI responses and refine their requests by adjusting their communication styles to interact with the AI effectively.
Phrase: Refine requests through adaptive interaction.

2.
Concepts: improving code with ai, proposing code improvements
Relationship: The two concepts are complementary, as improving code with AI involves proposing code improvements.
Criteria: Participants use AI to improve code by proposing their own fixes and suggesting improvements for AI-generated code.
Phrase: Propose code improvements through AI collaboration.

3.
Concepts: valuing ai feedback, valuing chatgpt's timely feedback
Relationship: The two concepts are synonymous, as valuing AI feedback is equivalent to valuing ChatGPT's timely feedback.
Criteria: Participants value feedback from AI, particularly the timely support provided by ChatGPT.
Phrase: Value timely AI feedback.

4.
Concepts: emphasizing clear instruction writing, emphasizing instruction writing skills
Relationship: The two concepts are equivalent, as emphasizing clear instruction writing is equivalent to emphasizing instruction writing skills.
Criteria: Participants stress the importance of writing clear instructions, which requires effective instruction writing skills.
Phrase: Emphasize clear instruction writing skills.

5.
Concepts: ai self-correction, appreciating ai's error resolution
Relationship: The two concepts are interconnected, as AI self-correction leads to appreciating its error resolution capabilities.
Criteria: Participants appreciate AI's ability to correct itself and resolve errors autonomously.
Phrase: Appreciate AI's self-correction capabilities.

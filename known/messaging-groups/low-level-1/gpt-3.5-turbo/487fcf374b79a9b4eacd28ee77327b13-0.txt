1. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).
2. P11: 23333
3. P11: I was just about to say.
4. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
5. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
6. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?
7. P14: It seems a bit troublesome.
8. P2: ……
9. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now.
10. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.

1. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
2. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
3. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits. So I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know. So please enlighten me in the future if I don't understand. Thank you.
4. P4: Have you updated it?
5. P11: It's not ideal...
6. P11: I will consider the impedance.
7. P11: Hmm, I just updated to the latest version.
8. P11: Thank you.
9. P12: My sister just found a chat group where the group owner has gone crazy and keeps sending out red packets. The group code is 695176754, everyone hurry and grab them.
10. P5: ã€‚
11. P5: @Designer

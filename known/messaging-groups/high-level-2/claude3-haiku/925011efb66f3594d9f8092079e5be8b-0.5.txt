Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

* Summary
This conversation is about a user (P8) sharing an image, and another user (Designer) offering to help upload a high-resolution image without a watermark for a profile picture. The conversation then shifts to the Designer asking if the user (P4229) is a teacher.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. **Participatory Design**: Examine how the community members engage in collaborative problem-solving and the dynamics of their interactions.
2. **Learning Sciences**: Investigate the potential for knowledge sharing and community-building within the online group.
3. **Human-Computer Interaction**: Analyze the technical aspects of image sharing and the user experience within the platform.

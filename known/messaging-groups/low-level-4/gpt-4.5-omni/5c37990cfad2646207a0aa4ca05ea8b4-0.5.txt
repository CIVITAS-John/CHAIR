You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: share workaround; reference past experience; provide practical advice
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: confirm understanding; agree with suggestion; validate experience
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: suggest new functionality; emphasize convenience; propose workflow improvement
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: affirm planned feature; reassure user; confirm alignment with user needs
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquire about classroom internet; consider implementation context; gather additional information
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: explain lack of internet; reference past incident; highlight security concerns; use humor
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Summary: The conversation revolves around practical challenges and suggestions for improving Physics Lab software, focusing on internet access and functionality like exporting experiments. User-4232 shares their experience and suggests features to enhance classroom use, which Designer-1 acknowledges and confirms as planned. The discussion touches on the lack of internet in classrooms due to past incidents, leading designers to consider local export options. The interaction highlights the positive impact of the software on students and gathers user feedback to inform future updates. User-4233 seeks download instructions, and Designer-2 suggests group sharing as a solution.

Notes: The conversation underscores the importance of user feedback in shaping software design, particularly in educational contexts with specific constraints like internet access. The positive reception in classrooms suggests the software's potential for engaging students, while the designers' responsiveness indicates a collaborative approach to development. Future analysis could explore how these interactions influence the community's growth and the software's evolution.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 sharing past experiences with touch screens and browsers in a school setting
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 acknowledging designer 1's comments
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 expressing the need for an export function or the ability to save/import experiments for convenience in different settings
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 confirming the upcoming addition of the requested features
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 inquiring about the availability of internet in the user's class for future feature considerations
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 explaining the lack of internet in the class due to a previous incident with inappropriate content
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Thoughts: In this round of coding, we see users expressing the need for specific features like export functions and offline usability, sharing their experiences using the software in educational settings, and designers responding to user feedback and hinting at upcoming updates. The conversation also touches upon issues related to internet access in schools and the impact of software on student engagement. From a learning sciences perspective, it is interesting to explore how the software is being used in educational settings and its effects on student learning. From a human-computer interaction angle, we can analyze the user requests for new features and the designers' responses. In terms of participatory design, we can observe how users' feedback is being incorporated into the development process.

Interpretations for each message:
1. Sharing past experiences with touch screens and browsers in a school setting.
2. Acknowledging designer 1's comments.
3. Expressing the need for an export function or the ability to save/import experiments for convenience in different settings.
4. Confirming the upcoming addition of the requested features.
5. Inquiring about the availability of internet in the user's class for future feature considerations.
6. Explaining the lack of internet in the class due to a previous incident with inappropriate content.
7. Reacting with laughter.
8. Suggesting the need for local export support.
9. Explaining reasons behind schools disabling internet on classroom computers.
10. Acknowledging user's input.
11. Praising the simulation effect of the software on student engagement.
12. Inquiring about the user's teaching level.
13. Sharing teaching background.
14. Informing about the upcoming release of a new version of Physics Lab.
15. Apologizing for the late-night message.
16. User 4233 inquiring about how to download the software.
17. Politely asking for assistance.
18. Hinting at a feature related to group sharing.

Summary: The conversation revolves around user feedback regarding the need for additional features like export functions and offline usability, experiences of using the software in educational settings, and designers responding to user input and providing updates on the software. Internet access issues in schools and the impact of the software on student engagement are also discussed.

Notes: The dialogue highlights the importance of considering users' needs and contexts in the design and development of educational software like Physics Lab. The incorporation of features like export functions and offline usability can enhance the utility of the software in diverse educational settings with varying technological constraints. The designers' responsiveness to user feedback and their engagement with the online community indicate a participatory approach to software development.

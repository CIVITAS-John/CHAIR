You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (10 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
10. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary phrases: sharing professional background
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
Preliminary phrases: providing development update; managing user expectations
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
Preliminary phrases: apologizing for inconvenience
4. User-4233: How to download?
Preliminary phrases: requesting guidance; expressing confusion
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary phrases: apologizing for interruption
6. Designer-2: Group sharing.
Preliminary phrases: suggesting new feature
7. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
9. User-4234: [Emoji 2-56]
10. User-4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on understanding the context and intent behind each message. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective to identify how users are interacting with the designers and each other, and how the designers are facilitating this interaction. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll examine how the designers are managing user expectations and providing guidance. Finally, from a participatory design perspective, I'll look for instances of co-design and user involvement in the development process.

Interpretations for each message:

1. sharing professional background; establishing credibility
2. providing development update; managing user expectations; setting timeline
3. apologizing for inconvenience; showing empathy
4. requesting guidance; expressing confusion; seeking clarification
5. apologizing for interruption; showing politeness
6. suggesting new feature; exploring possibilities
7. providing guidance; offering solution; directing to resource
8. soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; outlining development plan
9. expressing enthusiasm; showing appreciation; using emotional cues
10. expressing excitement; showing playfulness; using emotional cues

Summary: The conversation begins with a user sharing their professional background, followed by a designer providing an update on the development of Physics Lab. The designer apologizes for a late-night disturbance, and a user requests guidance on how to download the software. The conversation then shifts to suggestions for new features, with a designer soliciting feedback and outlining the development plan. The tone of the conversation is collaborative and polite, with users and designers showing empathy and enthusiasm.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, providing updates and guidance, and soliciting feedback. The users are responding with enthusiasm and politeness, suggesting a positive and collaborative atmosphere. I hypothesize that this online community is emerging as a result of the designers' efforts to involve users in the development process, and that this participatory approach is fostering a sense of ownership and engagement among users.

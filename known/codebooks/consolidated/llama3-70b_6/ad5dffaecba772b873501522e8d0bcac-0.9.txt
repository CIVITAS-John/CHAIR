You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: provided constructive feedback
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

Label: confirmed user's point
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.

3.
Label: user 4232 compares with other software
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

4.
Label: user 4232 advises on development
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

5.
Label: proposed alternative system
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

6.
Label: ensure accuracy
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

7.
Label: explain reasons for the request
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

8.
Label: demonstrated thoroughness
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

9.
Label: explained updates
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

Label: emphasized institutional policy
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

11.
Label: acknowledge provided resources
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

12.
Label: acknowledge receipt
Quotes:
- User: ok

Label: user 4232 explains common school policy
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

14.
Label: user 4232 suggests alternative system
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

15.
Label: prepare for further discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

16.
Label: questioned broader implications
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

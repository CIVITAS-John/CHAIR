You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: prepares interface before coding, constructs code iteratively, engages with coding process
- Participant prepares the interface before coding with AI.
- Participants construct code iteratively, creating code skeletons before interacting with AI.
- Participants engage with the coding process, dictating parameters for AI-generated code.

2.
Concepts: seeking ai assistance
- Participants seek AI assistance for specific tasks or problems.
- Participants seek AI's assistance in formulating mathematical equations.

3.
Concepts: efficiency importance
- Values efficiency
- Prioritizes efficiency in coding tasks.

4.
Concepts: identifying and correcting ai-generated code errors
- Participants identify and correct mistakes or errors in AI-generated code.
- The participant identifies errors in AI-generated code, specifically missing code structures or elements.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: prepares interface before coding, constructs code iteratively, engages with coding process
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they describe a proactive and iterative approach to coding with AI, where participants prepare, construct, and engage with the coding process.
Criteria: Participants prepare and engage with the coding process in an iterative manner, dictating parameters for AI-generated code.
Phrase: Prepares and iteratively constructs code with AI.

2.
Concepts: seeking ai assistance
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants seek AI assistance for specific tasks or problems.
Phrase: Seeks AI assistance.

3.
Concepts: efficiency importance
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants prioritize efficiency in coding tasks.
Phrase: Prioritizes efficiency.

4.
Concepts: identifying and correcting ai-generated code errors
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they describe a quality control process, where participants identify and correct errors in AI-generated code.
Criteria: Participants identify and correct mistakes or errors in AI-generated code.
Phrase: Identifies and corrects AI-generated code errors.

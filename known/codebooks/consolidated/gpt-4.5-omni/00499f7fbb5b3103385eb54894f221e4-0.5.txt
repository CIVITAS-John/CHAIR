You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

3. {Repeat the input 3}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 3}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 3}

1. soliciting feedback, feedback incorporation.
- Instances where designers or developers ask for user suggestions and feedback.
- Instances where user feedback influences design decisions and software development.

2. peer support, peer assistance and information sharing.
- Instances where users provide assistance or encouragement to each other.
- Community members helping each other with information and resources.

3. collaborative decision-making, collaborative problem solving.
- Moments where decisions are made collectively with input from multiple community members.
- Interactions where community members collectively work through issues or propose solutions.

Categories:
* User Interaction
* Community Collaboration
* Participatory Design

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. soliciting feedback, feedback incorporation.
Relationship: Feedback incorporation is a direct consequence of soliciting feedback; both are part of a feedback loop.
Criteria: Instances where user suggestions are actively sought and subsequently influence design decisions and software development.
Label: User Feedback Integration
Category: Participatory Design

2. peer support, peer assistance and information sharing.
Relationship: Peer assistance and information sharing are forms of peer support; they are different expressions of the same concept.
Criteria: Instances where community members provide assistance, encouragement, or share information and resources with each other.
Label: Peer Support and Sharing
Category: User Interaction

3. collaborative decision-making, collaborative problem solving.
Relationship: Collaborative problem solving is a specific form of collaborative decision-making; both involve collective input and resolution.
Criteria: Moments where decisions are made or problems are solved collectively with input from multiple community members.
Label: Collaborative Problem Solving
Category: Community Collaboration

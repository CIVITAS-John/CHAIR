You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: valuing ai assistance, valuing ai-driven interfaces' support
- Participants find AI helpful and value its assistance.
- Participants value AI-driven interfaces' support for task definition.

2.
Concepts: collaborative programming, suggesting ai-assisted collaboration
- Suggests AI as a potential partner in collaborative programming efforts.
- Participants suggest AI as a peer programmer and AI-assisted collaboration.

3.
Concepts: emphasizes collective problem solving, emphasizing human-ai collaboration and augmentation
- The participant emphasizes the importance of collective problem-solving and collaboration between humans and AI.
- The participant emphasizes the importance of human-AI collaboration and augmentation.

4.
Concepts: integrating ai-generated code, customizing ai-generated code
- Participants integrate AI-generated code into their model.
- Participants adapt and customize AI-generated code with AI assistance.

5.
Concepts: notes unhelpful error messages, struggling with unclear error messages
- Participants note that error messages are often unhelpful or incorrect, highlighting a bug in the system.
- Participants get stuck and express frustration due to unclear error messages.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: valuing ai assistance, valuing ai-driven interfaces' support
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as valuing AI assistance implies valuing the support provided by AI-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants value AI-driven interfaces' support for task definition and find AI helpful in their work.
Phrase: Value AI assistance and support.

2.
Concepts: collaborative programming, suggesting ai-assisted collaboration
Relationship: The two concepts are complementary, as suggesting AI-assisted collaboration implies a willingness to engage in collaborative programming with AI.
Criteria: Participants suggest AI as a peer programmer and propose collaborative programming efforts with AI assistance.
Phrase: Suggest AI-assisted collaboration.

3.
Concepts: emphasizes collective problem solving, emphasizing human-ai collaboration and augmentation
Relationship: The two concepts are interchangeable, as emphasizing collective problem-solving implies emphasizing human-AI collaboration and augmentation.
Criteria: Participants emphasize the importance of human-AI collaboration and augmentation for collective problem-solving.
Phrase: Emphasize human-AI collaboration.

4.
Concepts: integrating ai-generated code, customizing ai-generated code
Relationship: The two concepts are sequential, as integrating AI-generated code often requires customizing it to fit specific needs.
Criteria: Participants integrate and adapt AI-generated code with AI assistance to fit their model.
Phrase: Integrate and customize AI-generated code.

5.
Concepts: notes unhelpful error messages, struggling with unclear error messages
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as struggling with unclear error messages often results from noting unhelpful error messages.
Criteria: Participants experience difficulties due to unclear or unhelpful error messages in AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Struggle with unclear error messages.

Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation covers a range of topics related to physics, astronomy, and software development. The participants engage in discussions about the moon, Mars, gravitational waves, and various software and simulations. They share images, ask questions, provide suggestions, and express opinions and humor.
1. P2: It's not a brushless motor that connects to AC.
2. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
3. P14: 
4. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
5. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
6. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
7. P14: [Image]
8. P2: Has it been burned?
9. P4: Just play a rotating animation if you turn on the power, that's it 23333.
10. P2: Do we still need algorithms?
11. P4: 2333, it's simple.
12. P2: Algorithms are not simple.
13. P2: IGDT can also add @Designer 
14. P13: [Image]
15. P13: Are you all fake?
16. P13: Are you from outer space?
17. P13: I don't understand.
18. P2: Transistors can also be used.
19. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do normal experiments like this...
20. P11: 233 is in electronic circuits.
21. P11: I don't understand either.
22. P2: In the CPU.
23. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned some when I took an optional course in circuits.
24. P2: Add a bipolar capacitor.
25. P2: I learned by myself.
26. P11: That's great, if you have hobbies in it.
27. P14: @P11 Are there still distinctions between arts and sciences now?
28. P2: no
29. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
30. P14: [Image]

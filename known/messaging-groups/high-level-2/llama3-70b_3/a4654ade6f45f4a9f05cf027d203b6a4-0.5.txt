Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1

1. P4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. P4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab online message group:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with P4230 requesting a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and vibrations, followed by the Designer's response on prioritizing the electrical section. P4231 asks about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab, and the Designer shares an image and updates on the student power supply component.

* Plan
Analyze the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to understand how the Physics Lab online community emerged. Guiding questions: How do users contribute to the development of Physics Lab? How do designers respond to user requests? What features are prioritized, and why?

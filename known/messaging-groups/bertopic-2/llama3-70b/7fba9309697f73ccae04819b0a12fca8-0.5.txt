You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Reason through the data comprehensively start coding. When coding, also look at the interviewer's observations. Take note of emotions explicitly or implicitly expressed by the interviewee. Try to find multiple codes through the lens of human-computer interaction and learning sciences.

Always follow the output format:
===
Thought: {What is the most common theme among the input quotes? Do not over-interpret the data.}
Phrase: {A single verb phrase that faithfully describes the topic}
===
~~~
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 dictated each of the parameter fields.
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 reads error messages before making a choice.
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 chooses to fix the problem rather than showing the explanation.
Keywords: e01, interviewer, verbal, response, observation

Thought: The interviewee's behavior and actions while interacting with the LLM-driven interface.
Phrase: "Avoids verbal responses"

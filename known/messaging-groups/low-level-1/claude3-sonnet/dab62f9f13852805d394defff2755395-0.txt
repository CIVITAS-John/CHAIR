Summary: This conversation is about clarifying the meaning of the phrase "+1" used to express agreement or having the same opinion in online discussions. Some participants use "+1" to agree, while another participant asks for clarification on its meaning. Other participants then explain that "+1" means "me too" or expressing the same opinion.

Notes: This conversation shows how members of an online community negotiate and establish shared meanings and conventions for communication. The use of "+1" seems to be a shorthand way of expressing agreement, and when a new member is unfamiliar with this convention, others take the time to explain it. This process of clarifying meanings and norms can contribute to the emergence and cohesion of an online community.

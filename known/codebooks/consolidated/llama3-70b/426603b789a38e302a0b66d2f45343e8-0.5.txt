You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
3. {Repeat the input 3}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 3}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 3}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 3}

~~~
1. community roles and contexts, role identification and profiling
- Users or designers identify different roles or types of users in the community.
- Users or designers identify or inquire about each other's roles or affiliations.

2. ease of use, accessibility
- Factors related to the usability and accessibility of the Physics Lab software for users.
- Discussions around the accessibility and compatibility of the Physics Lab software

3. technical constraints, contextual constraints
- Technical limitations or restrictions are discussed or encountered
- This code identifies discussions that highlight specific environmental or contextual constraints that impact the use or deployment of the Physics Lab software in educational settings.

Definitions for each code (3 in total):

1. community roles and contexts, role identification and profiling
Relationship: Inclusive (Concepts are related to each other, with role identification being a part of understanding community roles and contexts)
Criteria: Users or designers identify or discuss roles, types, or affiliations of users in the community
Label: Community Characterization

2. ease of use, accessibility
Relationship: Overlapping (Concepts are related, with ease of use being a factor in accessibility)
Criteria: Users or designers discuss or experience issues related to the usability and accessibility of the Physics Lab software
Label: Software Usability

3. technical constraints, contextual constraints
Relationship: Inclusive (Concepts are related, with technical constraints being a type of contextual constraint)
Criteria: Technical or environmental limitations or restrictions are discussed or encountered in the use of the Physics Lab software
Label: Operational Limitations

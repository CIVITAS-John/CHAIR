You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

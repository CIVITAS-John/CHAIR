You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

* Summary
The conversation involves a user asking for help to upload a high-definition version of an avatar, with a designer offering to assist. The user confirms they are a teacher.

* Plan
In this conversation, we can explore the user's needs and challenges in uploading content, the designer's role in supporting users, and how the interaction reflects the participatory design process. From a learning sciences perspective, we can analyze how the designer facilitates learning through technical support. In terms of human-computer interaction, we can examine the user's experience in interacting with the platform and the designer. Additionally, through the lens of participatory design, we can investigate how users, like the teacher in this case, contribute to the design and development of the online community.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

* Summary
This conversation involves designers of Physics Lab discussing the development of new features, particularly for electricity experiments and circuit diagrams. They seek input from users, especially teachers, about current textbook standards. The designers show openness to feedback and a commitment to improving the product. There's also discussion about upcoming updates across different platforms.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we'll focus on themes related to collaborative design, user engagement, and iterative development. We'll examine how the designers interact with users, incorporate feedback, and communicate about the development process. Key questions to consider: How do designers involve users in the development process? How do they balance different user needs? How do they communicate about updates and changes? How does this interaction contribute to the emergence of the online community?

# Collaborative Design Process
## Seeking User Input
Definition: Designers actively requesting feedback or information from users to inform design decisions
- "Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?"
- "When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group"
- "This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results"

## Incorporating User Feedback
Definition: Designers adapting their plans or designs based on user suggestions or preferences
- "Okay."
- "So, use both?"
- "Thank you all for your support. We will do better!"

# Feature Development
## Planning New Features
Definition: Designers discussing or announcing plans for new functionalities or improvements
- "For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment"
- "We are working on this part"
- "Make it simpler..."

## Iterative Development
Definition: Designers showing a process of gradual improvement and refinement of features
- "This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only..."
- "The update is quite large..."

# Community Engagement
## Transparent Communication
Definition: Designers openly sharing information about development progress and plans
- "Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend."
- "There will be an update."

## User Anticipation
Definition: Users expressing interest or excitement about upcoming changes or updates
- "Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]"

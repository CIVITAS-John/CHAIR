You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Relationship: The concepts are closely related as they both refer to the potential of AI in translating jargon between sub-groups, with one concept focusing on the suggestion and the other on the discussion.
Criteria: Participants suggest or discuss the potential of AI to translate jargon between different sub-groups working in the same system.
Phrase: Suggesting AI-based jargon translation

2.
Concepts: acknowledging ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they all refer to the recognition of limitations in AI capabilities, with different aspects of limitations being highlighted.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge the limitations of AI, including its capabilities in handling large code bases, debugging, and checking generated code with external information.
Phrase: Acknowledging AI limitations

3.
Concepts: requesting ai assistance
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both refer to the desire for AI assistance in specific tasks, with different tasks being mentioned.
Criteria: Participants request AI assistance for specific tasks, such as creating a checkerboard pattern or a neural network.

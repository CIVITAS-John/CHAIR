You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: employing iterative learning and development with ai, incorporating ai for code enhancement and learning
- Users describe an iterative process of learning and developing models with AI assistance.
- Users integrate AI-generated suggestions to iteratively optimize their code and use AI-generated examples as a learning tool.

2.
Concepts: correcting and interacting with ai-generated code, customizing and integrating ai-generated code
- Users independently correct errors and interact with AI-generated code.
- Users selectively use and integrate AI-generated code into their projects, making manual adjustments.

3.
Concepts: syntax support, seeking ai assistance for syntax queries
- Users rely on AI for syntax support and occasionally check the NetLogo dictionary.
- Users make specific queries to AI for NetLogo syntax and functions when they need precise code structures.

4.
Concepts: arguing for ai efficiency, highlighting ai's efficiency and cost-saving benefits
- User argues for the efficiency benefits of using AI.
- Users highlight the time and cost-saving aspects of using AI for documentation searches and other tasks.

5.
Concepts: reflects on novice challenges, addresses novice challenges with ai
- Users reflect on the struggles novices face when dealing with human-AI collaboration.
- Users discuss the needs and challenges faced by novices in using AI.

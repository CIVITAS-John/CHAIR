1. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, and may produce some weird results.
2. Designer: [Image]
3. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
4. P4234: Will there be updates this week? [Emoji]
5. Designer: There will be updates. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version over the weekend.
6. Designer: The update is quite substantial...
7. P4236: [Emoji]
8. P4234: [Emoji]
9. Designer: Don't worry, it will be there, in the final optimization round of the circuit diagram.
10. Designer: Although manual layout adjustments are possible
11. Designer: But it's still better to make the automatically generated one as good as possible
12. P4234: Yes, the spirit of continuous improvement like a skilled craftsman ðŸ¤”
13. Designer: This belongs to the kind of function that ensures long-term stability after it's done... It's actually simpler to add various components.
14. Designer: The Apple Store is still under review, let's upload the PC version first.
15. Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
Enhanced the 3D appearance of various types of meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeters and meter zeroing.
The next version will provide AC waveform display.
The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Adjustments
Dry batteries can now be ideal power sources.
All meters can now switch between ideal and real modes.

# Special Note
The Esc key now minimizes the window.
Ctrl+E can switch between exam and normal modes.
16. P4237: [Emoji]
17. Designer: The new version has been sent in the group.
18. Designer: iOS is waiting for review~
19. P4237: [Emoji]
20. P4237: ok
21. P4232: [Emoji]
22. Designer: The version in the group is for the computer.
23. Designer: Android is expected to be updated tonight.
24. Designer: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch.
25. P4238: Has Android not been updated yet?

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: explaining feature complexity, explaining limitations of a feature or platform
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve designers providing explanations about the platform or features, but they differ in focus, with one highlighting complexity and the other highlighting limitations.
Criteria: Designers provide explanations about the technical challenges or limitations of a feature or platform to users.
Phrase: Explain technical constraints

2.
Concepts: explain focus areas, explaining development process and design goals
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve designers providing explanations about the development process, with one focusing on priorities and the other on the underlying principles.
Criteria: Designers provide explanations about the focus areas, development process, and design goals to users.
Phrase: Clarify design priorities

3.
Concepts: seeking efficiency and simplification, refining design and optimizing features
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both involve designers aiming to improve the design or features, with one focusing on simplification and the other on refinement.
Criteria: Designers aim to simplify or refine design elements or features to improve user experience.
Phrase: Optimize design elements

4.
Concepts: express gratitude
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Users or designers express appreciation or gratitude towards others in the online community.
Phrase: Express appreciation

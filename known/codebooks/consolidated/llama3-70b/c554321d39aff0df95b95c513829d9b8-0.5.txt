You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)

1.
Label: comparison with other applications
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

2.
Label: consideration
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

3.
Label: detailed overview of update
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

4.
Label: user input/feedback/suggestion with justifications
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

5.
Label: response to clarification
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

6.
Label: frustration
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

7.
Label: elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- User: [Image]

8.
Label: design/feature suggestion
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

9.
Label: contextualizing response
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

10.
Label: politeness
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

11.
Label: elaboration of response
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

12.
Label: design rationale
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

13.
Label: user need
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

14.
Label: encouraging elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

15.
Label: design suggestion
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

16.
Label: product gap
Quotes:

17.
Label: current efforts
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

18.
Label: future update
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

19.
Label: elaboration of suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa

20.
Label: user satisifcation
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

21.
Label: explanation
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

22.
Label: expression of interest
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

23.
Label: ethusiasm
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- User: This idea is really good

24.
Label: offering co-designing
Quotes:

25.
Label: teacher-admin interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

26.
Label: teacher response
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- User: Left side

27.
Label: teaching
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

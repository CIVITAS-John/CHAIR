You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Thoughts: When analyzing this conversation, it is essential to look at how community norms and language usage are established and reinforced. The "+1" responses suggest a form of community bonding and minimal input that still conveys agreement and solidarity. The inquiry about the meaning of "+1" and the subsequent explanations highlight social learning and the transmission of community-specific knowledge. It will be crucial to identify how these interactions contribute to the emergence and development of the online community, focusing on aspects like communication norms, social bonding, and the role of humor and self-deprecation.

Summary: The conversation revolves around the use of the term "+1" within the Physics Lab online community. P14 makes a self-deprecating comment, which is met with several "+1" responses from P13, P15, and P16, indicating agreement and community bonding through minimal input. P10 asks for clarification about the meaning of "+1," and P11 and P13 provide explanations, reinforcing community norms and facilitating social learning. P13's additional comments suggest a mix of informal communication and guidance towards self-sufficiency by recommending an external resource (Baidu).

Notes: The repeated use of "+1" indicates a shared understanding and a form of shorthand communication within the community. The inquiry and explanations about "+1" show how new members or less knowledgeable participants learn community norms. P14's self-deprecation and humor may serve as a social bonding mechanism, fostering a sense of camaraderie. The suggestion to use Baidu reflects a norm of encouraging self-sufficiency and leveraging external resources for information.

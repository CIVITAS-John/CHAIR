Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

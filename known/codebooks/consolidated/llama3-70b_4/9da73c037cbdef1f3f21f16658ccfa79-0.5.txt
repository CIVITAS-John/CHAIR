1.
Label: suggesting that users need practice in debugging their own code and need to have exercises before asking ai
Quotes:
- E01: Part of this, the user needs a little practice in debugging their own code. There should be some exercises before you ask GPT to do this.  (interviewer's observation) Users need practice in debugging their own code and need to have exercises before asking AI.

2.
Label: identifying ai's limitation in resolving certain errors
Quotes:
- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.

3.
Label: considers subjective nature of human judgment
Quotes:
- E01: I think the key is to not replace human judgment and ability, but to find a fast way to increase human capability and judgment. (interviewer's observation) Augmentation of human capabilities & building on human judgement. Subjectivity of humanity?

4.
Label: chatlogo ability (positive)
Quotes:
- E04: It includes debugging, it is actually trying to incorporate like a unit test, which is really cool and really helpful, especially for beginners, because they can kind of, you know, check their inputs. Beginners, everyone really. They can debug their code appropriately. (interviewer's observation) Debugging capability.
- E04: It was really nice that it, like with the troubleshooting errors, for example, like at least in principle, I know that we had this one that we couldn't fix. It seemed like it was able to kind of do some better troubleshooting to a certain extent. (interviewer's observation) Better troubleshooting capability.
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.
- E04: It seems to explain things pretty well, it does not seems to be overly technical. (interviewer's observation) Provides clear, less technical explanations.
- E04: It's basically following best practices. It is not trying to ruthlessly create a model. (interviewer's observation) Not "ruthlessly create a model".

5.
Label: learning in fragments
Quotes:
- E01: Depending on what you do and how busy you are and the higher ranking people are, the more busy they are, the longer it is between sessions. So you make some notes on little yellow, sticky cinnamon. And then you go back to your administrator job for two months, and then some other project comes up. And then six months later, you come back. Okay, now, where was I? (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on how professionals learn - they learn in fragments, in fragmented time blocks and need support from the system to remind them where they were.

6.
Label: suggests gradual learning
Quotes:
- E01: And, and they don't, this is an unfamiliar task to them apparently. So they want to ask one question and get the right answer the first time. And I, I don't have that expectation. I'll ask the right question and it'll get me 80% of the way there. (interviewer's observation) Novices might have a too high expectation for ChatGPT (but it cannot achieve that).

7.
Label: unpredictable ai behavior
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

8.
Label: finds ai helpful for syntax reminders
Quotes:
- E04: Because I'll like forget the syntax sometimes and I usually use the netlogo dictionary and just have it like open to the side. (interviewer's observation) E04 still forgets about the syntax and ChatGPT can help.

9.
Label: implies careful decision making
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 reads error messages before making a choice.

10.
Label: and easy to read generated code
Quotes:
- E01: I don't want chat GPT to write 27 operations in one line and show how brilliant it is. I wanted to separate out the code and, and it did a good job of not only did it write the code, but it commented the code. And then in addition to commenting the code externally, it did documentation. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT tends to provide comments and documentation. Generated code is easy to read.

11.
Label: simplifying task for ai
Quotes:
- E04: "Draw a smiley face" / "Drawing on the canvas" (interviewer's observation) E04 switches to a simpler task.

12.

- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

13.
Label: feels stuck with ai errors
Quotes:

14.
Label: utilizing ai for syntax reminders
Quotes:
- E04: Because I'll like forget the syntax sometimes and I usually use the netlogo dictionary and just have it like open to the side. (interviewer's observation) E04 still forgets about the syntax and ChatGPT can help.

15.
Label: finds explanation option annoying
Quotes:

16.
Label: proposing ai powered linting
Quotes:
- E01: So I see this from beginners all the time is they, they just get totally lost. I call it lint program from Unix, you know, it's like it's a little green checkbox looks at you and go, okay, wait, it's just, you've spelled everything correctly, but you have a conceptual error here. If it, if it caught structural problems like that, that would, that would help. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo needs to have linting features that exist in other languages (we are working on that right now). Here, E01 wants the linting to support identifying conceptual mistakes, different from syntax mistakes which most linters work on.

17.
Label: identifies ai misunderstanding
Quotes:
- E01: So set up, move the turtle to go. Increase the size of the turtle by two units. Oh, dear. It's, it's making the turtle bigger.

(interviewer's observation) E01 reads the code and comments, summarizing the code, and thinks about how the AI was understanding the request.

18.
Label: novice's challenge of asking the right question
Quotes:
- E01: And, and they don't, this is an unfamiliar task to them apparently. So they want to ask one question and get the right answer the first time. And I, I don't have that expectation. I'll ask the right question and it'll get me 80% of the way there. (interviewer's observation) Novices might have a too high expectation for ChatGPT (but it cannot achieve that).

19.
Label: states initial task for ai
Quotes:
- E01: So let's say "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square." (interviewer's observation) E01's first task.

20.
Label: mentions need for external validation
Quotes:
- E01: And some of them we still haven't been doing like hive mind, like how we are going to have the machine learning back from the user feedback or just from the compiler, right? You generate some code, but it doesn't work. So we have to tell you that this time, you didn't work. (interviewer's observation) The current ChatGPT implementation cannot check the generated code with external information (compiler, etc.) (partially solved by the Interpreter plugin, but only Python at this time)

21.
Label: requests ai to verify code
Quotes:
- E01: "can you verify that no more names are reserved words in NetLogo?" I don't know if it can do that. (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug after the third iteration, he asks ChatGPT to verify the code and produce no more bug. Unsure if it could do that.

22.
Label: describes ai catching non obvious errors
Quotes:
- E01: I don't know how much it understands about all of the efficiencies of NetLogo... But it (could) catch obvious errors that are not obvious to me. Even if it's relatively dumb, it's an outside observer, which is great. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could serve as an outside observer that points out errors human did not realize.

23.
Label: expresses uncertainty
Quotes:
- E01: "can you verify that no more names are reserved words in NetLogo?" I don't know if it can do that. (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug after the third iteration, he asks ChatGPT to verify the code and produce no more bug. Unsure if it could do that.

24.
Label: communicates modeling needs to ai
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a simple feed-forward neural network in NetLogo with one hidden layer."

25.
Label: provides more details
Quotes:
- E01: "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square, but the square should go larger each time it goes around." (interviewer's observation) Seeing AI's counter question, E01 makes his request more detailed.

26.
Label: shares an incident of ai hallucination
Quotes:
- E01: So maybe the details are wrong and, you know, Michael Tamalo or somebody jumped on me because I posted some answer and it used some function that wasn't available. AI had hallucinated some function. (interviewer's observation) AI might hallucinates.

27.
Label: decides to run ai code
Quotes:
- E04: Oh and you can run it. That's cool. (interviewer's observation) E04 reads the AI output and decides to copy & paste it although he could also run it.

28.
Label: expecting chat gpt to find relevant models
Quotes:
- E04: I know that Perceptron model exists in the NetLogo model library. So it's interesting to me that it didn't pull that up, but it could be that I used like the wrong verbiage, but it doesn't understand what I'm trying to do. (interviewer's observation) E04 expects ChatLogo to find "Perceptron" model from the library but it does not. He evaluates the search results of the AI.

29.
Label: likes the automatic integration of generated code into the model
Quotes:
- E04: I really liked how, like the code that it generates, if you could just kind of place that into the model automatically.  (interviewer's observation) The capability to put into the model automatically.

30.
Label: goal oriented ai usage
Quotes:
- E04: The typical idea that I had was like a very, very simple neural network. (interviewer's observation) Task: a very simple neural network

31.
Label: cost savings through early detection
Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

32.
Label: proposing specific code modifications to ai
Quotes:
- E04: "Can train-perceptron be turned into a reporter" (interviewer's observation) E04 uses "can you fix with my own idea".

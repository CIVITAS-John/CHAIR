You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: highlighting the importance of zero adjustment
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

2.
Label: addressing bug fixes
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

7.
Label: appreciating design philosophy
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

8.
Label: explanation of upcoming features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

9.
Label: provide status update
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: We are working on this part
- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

10.
Label: describing user interactions
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

11.
Label: encourage feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

12.
Label: inquiring about image upload
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

13.
Label: confirming agreement
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

14.
Label: confirming teacher identity
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

15.
Label: verifying understanding
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

16.
Label: sharing new features
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

17.
Label: sharing professional background
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

18.
Label: striving for design perfection
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

19.
Label: providing information about downloading the windows version
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

20.
Label: update on review status
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

21.
Label: thinking about user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

22.
Label: feature request
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

23.
Label: shows consideration for users' time
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

24.
Label: use the metaphor of craftsmanship to refer to app development
Quotes:

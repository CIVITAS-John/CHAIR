Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

* Summary
This conversation is about the meaning of the "+1" expression used in the online message group of Physics Lab. The participants are trying to explain and clarify the meaning of this expression to one of the group members who is unfamiliar with it.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we can draw insights from the learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design perspectives. From the learning sciences, we can examine how the group members engage in knowledge sharing and collaborative learning to help a newcomer understand a common expression used in their online community. From the human-computer interaction angle, we can look at how the participants use various communication strategies, such as brevity and reference to external resources, to convey information effectively in an online setting. Finally, from the participatory design perspective, we can consider how the group's response to the newcomer's question reflects the level of inclusiveness and the dynamics of participation within the online community.

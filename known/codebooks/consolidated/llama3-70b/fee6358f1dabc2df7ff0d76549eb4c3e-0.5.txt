You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: recognize the need for human expertise, recognizing the need for human effort to learn ai-generated code
Relationship: The two concepts are interconnected, as recognizing the need for human expertise implies acknowledging the limitations of AI-generated code and the need for human effort to understand and learn from it.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge the importance of human judgment and expertise when working with AI-generated content and recognize the need for human effort to learn and understand AI-generated code.
Phrase: Acknowledge human expertise limitations

2.
Concepts: appreciate ai's capabilities, appreciating ai's clear explanations
Relationship: The two concepts are complementary, as appreciating AI's capabilities is closely tied to appreciating its ability to provide clear explanations and feedback.
Criteria: Participants value AI's ability to assist with equation development and provide clear and easy-to-understand explanations and feedback.
Phrase: Value AI's explanatory capabilities

3.
Concepts: view ai as beneficial, appreciate ai's time-saving capabilities
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as viewing AI as beneficial is closely tied to appreciating its ability to save time and reduce the learning curve.
Criteria: Participants perceive AI as a time-saving tool with positive abilities and appreciate its ability to save time and reduce the learning curve.
Phrase: Perceive AI as beneficial

4.
Concepts: human-ai (positive): collaboration, ai as a collaborative partner
Relationship: The two concepts are interconnected, as collaboration with AI implies viewing AI as a partner that can provide input and improve code.
Criteria: Participants envision AI as a collaborative partner that can provide input and improve code, and seek to collaborate with AI to optimize code and debugging processes.
Phrase: Envision AI as a collaborative partner

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for it.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
2. {Repeat the input 2}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 2, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 2}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 2}

~~~
1. Label: future plans, development plan
- Discussing plans or goals for future development or implementation.
- Plans or discussions about future development, including timelines or milestones.

2. Label: use case description and expansion, user input/feedback/suggestion with justifications
- Users describe or suggest use cases or scenarios.
- Users providing input, feedback, or suggestions with justifications or explanations

Definitions for each code:

1. Label: future plans, development plan
Relationship: Inclusion (development plan is a type of future plan)
Criteria: Participants discuss or outline goals, timelines, or milestones for future development or implementation of the online community.
Label: Future Development Planning

2. Label: use case description and expansion, user input/feedback/suggestion with justifications
Relationship: Parallel (use case descriptions and user input/feedback/suggestions are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Users provide descriptions or suggestions for use cases or scenarios, and/or offer input, feedback, or suggestions with explanations or justifications.
Label: User-Generated Ideas and Feedback

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P5: It means I need a logic gate exactly, to build a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
2. P6: [Image 14]
3. P6: [Image 15]
4. P7: How to play?
5. Designer: Play by conducting experiments ðŸ˜‚
6. P8: Why suddenly add a wave?
7. P7: Oh
8. P2: [Image 20]

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

15.
Label: seeking to influence development
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

16.
Label: demonstrating long term thinking
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

20.
Label: offer a solution
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

21.
Label: noting for potential bugs

- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

22.
Label: describe students'positive responses in class
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

23.
Label: ensuring relevance to current teaching practices
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

25.
Label: acknowledging the limitations of the auto layout algorithm
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

26.
Label: managing expectations for complex features
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

27.
Label: seeking clarification on circuit diagram style
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

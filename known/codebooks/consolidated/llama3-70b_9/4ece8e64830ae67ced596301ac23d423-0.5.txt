You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: offers a diagnose for the problem
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

22.
Label: acknowledged software quality
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

23.
Label: clarified testing phase
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

24.
Label: suggest educational enhancements
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

25.
Label: user 4237 engages minimally
Quotes:
- User: ok

26.
Label: designer 1 continues problem solving discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

27.
Label: provide android update timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Here is a codebook to analyze the factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research on how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a user requesting features for mechanical waves and optical experiments, and the designer responds by prioritizing other sections before mechanics. The conversation then shifts to a new user asking about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab, and the designer responds with an image and updates about upcoming changes to the platform.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. We will examine how users and designers interact, negotiate, and prioritize features, and how this interaction contributes to the emergence of the online community. Guiding questions include: How do users and designers communicate and negotiate features? How do designers prioritize and respond to user requests? How do users interact with each other and with designers?

# Community Building

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: users and designers collaboratively discuss physics lab features
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

2.
Label: addressing technical challenges and limitations in using physics lab
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

3.

- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
- Designer: The one in the group is the PC version

5.
Label: requesting and discussing features for physics lab platform
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

6.
Label: designers prioritizing and optimizing physics lab development
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

7.
Label: designers facilitating community interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
- Designer: Hello :)
- Designer: Okay.

8.
Label: users seeking software usage guidance and resources
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software
- User: How do you use the PC version?
- User: Is there a user manual?
- User: How to download?

9.
Label: designers strategizing technical compatibility and updates for physics lab
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

10.
Label: users praising software design and functionality
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

11.
Label: designers considering soft keyboard implementation for touch screen devices
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

12.
Label: users and designers collaborate in pursuit of craftsmanship and perfection
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.
- Designer: ðŸ˜‚

13.
Label: users anticipate physics lab's online community development
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji]
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

14.
Label: designing features for bidirectional conversion of circuit diagrams
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

15.
Label: designers and users collaborating on interface layout
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- User: Left side

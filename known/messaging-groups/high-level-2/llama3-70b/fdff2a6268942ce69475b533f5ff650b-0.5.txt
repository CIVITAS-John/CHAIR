76. Designer: Calculated...
77. P2: How to calculate it?
78. P11: Okay.
79. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
80. P11: [Image 152]
81. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but it is an atomic model.
82. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
83. P1: Server?
84. P11: Hahaha.
85. Designer: Standalone.
86. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
87. Designer: Two types of motors.
88. P1: Are you on the server?

93. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
94. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple to follow the method I mentioned @Designer 
95. P14: [Image 168]
96. P2: What if it burns?
97. P4: Just power it on and play a rotating animation, that's it üòÇ
98. P2: Do we still need algorithms?
99. P4: üòÇ Simple and done.
100. P2: Algorithms are not simple.
101. P2: You can also add IGDT @Designer 
102. P13: [Image 175]
103. P13: Are you all fake?
104. P13: Are you from outer space?
105. P13: I don't understand.
106. P2: Transistors can also be used.
107. Designer: You can make some interesting components, but normal experiments shouldn't be done like this...
108. P11: üòÇ That's in electronic circuits.
109. P11: I don't understand either.
110. P2: It's in the CPU.
111. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned some when I took an optional course in circuits.
112. P2: Add a capacitive divider.
113. P2: I learned it by myself.
114. P11: That's great, especially if you have a hobby in it.
115. P14: @P11 Are there still distinctions between arts and sciences now?
116. P2: no
117. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
118. P14: [Image 191]
119. P14: ...Let me pass the exam first.
120. P2: I'm still in the second year of junior high school.
121. P11: Keep it up.
122. P13: From freshman year in high school.
123. P2: What about MOSFETs?
124. P2: @Designer 
125. P17: [Image 198]
126. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used with test tubes?
127. P2: +1

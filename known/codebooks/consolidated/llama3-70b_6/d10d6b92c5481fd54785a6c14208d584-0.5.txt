You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

16.
Label: novice's challenge of asking the right question
Quotes:
- E01: And, and they don't, this is an unfamiliar task to them apparently. So they want to ask one question and get the right answer the first time. And I, I don't have that expectation.

18.
Label: values documentation
Quotes:

Label: e04 expects ai to find specific net logo models
Quotes:
- E04: I know that Perceptron model exists in the NetLogo model library.

(interviewer's observation) E04 expects ChatLogo to find "Perceptron" model from the library but it does not. He evaluates the search results of the AI.

23.
Label: calls for better error messaging
Quotes:

- E04: "Draw a smiley face" / "Drawing on the canvas" (interviewer's observation) E04 switches to a simpler task.

26.
Label: envisioning collaborative ai learning
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

27.
Label: appreciates the value of online user groups for problem solving
Quotes:
- E01: I had a problem and I couldn't figure out how to solve this problem. I finally got online and I discovered there was this user group that would help you for free with problems. And it was stunning. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on seeking help online.

28.
Label: highlights risks for novices
Quotes:
- E04: To me, it seems like you need to have a certain degree of expertise to understand where the errors are and how to fix them. Because otherwise it's like you're going down this path where you're blindly following the ChatGPT and you have no idea what's going on. For less experienced people, I wouldn't like that because it could put you in a worse situation. (interviewer's observation) Requires expertise to understand errors and debug them. Risks to blindly follow ChatGPT, esp. for less experienced people.

29.
Label: limitations (large dataset)
Quotes:
- E01: It's about, let's see, what did I count is 3800 lines of code. Well, first I couldn't feed it all the ChatGPT can only take it 1800 lines at a time. And then I said, you know, can you tell me what this does? And it basically said, no. ... I can live with that again. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT's limitation on reading long code pieces.

30.
Label: identifying errors in ai generated code
Quotes:
- E04: So this is interesting because, you know, obviously it's wrong. So I have to kind of interpret what's going on here. (interviewer's observation) E04 fixes common NetLogo mistakes by himself.

31.
Label: emphasizes not replacing human judgment
Quotes:
- E01: I think the key is to not replace human judgment and ability, but to find a fast way to increase human capability and judgment. (interviewer's observation) Augmentation of human capabilities & building on human judgement. Subjectivity of humanity?

32.
Label: benefit of ai - interpretation of context
Quotes:
- E01: Depending on what you do and how busy you are and the higher ranking people are, the more busy they are, the longer it is between sessions. So you make some notes on little yellow, sticky cinnamon. And then you go back to your administrator job for two months, and then some other project comes up. And then six months later, you come back. Okay, now, where was I? (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on how professionals learn - they learn in fragments, in fragmented time blocks and need support from the system to remind them where they were.

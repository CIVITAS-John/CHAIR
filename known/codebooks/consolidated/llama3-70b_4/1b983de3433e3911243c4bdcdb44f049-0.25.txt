You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Concepts: evaluating ai responses, reasoning through ai responses, and interpreting ai responses
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected, as evaluating AI responses involves reasoning through the responses to identify potential discrepancies, and interpreting the responses is a crucial step in evaluating their accuracy.
Criteria: Participants critically assess and make sense of AI-generated responses to identify potential errors or inconsistencies.
Phrase: Critically evaluating AI responses

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: sample use cases, typical ai use cases
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe scenarios where AI-driven interfaces are utilized, with sample use cases providing specific examples and typical AI use cases describing more general scenarios.
Criteria: Participants provide or describe scenarios where AI-driven interfaces are used.
Phrase: Identifying AI use cases

2.
Concepts: seeking collaborative assistance, seeking ai-driven code assistance
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve seeking help from AI-driven interfaces, with collaborative assistance referring to general help and AI-driven code assistance referring to specific coding tasks.
Criteria: Participants request help from AI-driven interfaces for coding tasks or collaborative work.
Phrase: Requesting AI assistance

1. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
2. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.
3. Designer: Okay. Please give me more suggestions!
4. P4232: How to use the PC version?
5. P4232: [Image]
6. P8: It does not support the XP system.
7. P4232: Oh, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. P4232: Can it run on Win7?
9. P8: Win7 should work.
10. P4232: Thank you.
11. P8: You're welcome. If you encounter any problems during use, feel free to discuss them directly in the group.
12. P4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to do everything and ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer: I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to set up a virtual machine.
14. Designer: In theory, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from around 2008 onwards).

Thoughts: The conversation seems to be about the use and compatibility of a physics simulation software. The messages discuss the software's features, such as the removal of internal resistance and support for both DC and AC power supplies. There are also discussions about the software's compatibility with different operating systems, such as Windows XP and Windows 7. The conversation appears to be between a designer of the software and a user (P4232) who is interested in using the software.

Summary: The conversation discusses the features and compatibility of a physics simulation software, with the designer providing information about the software's capabilities and the user (P4232) asking about its compatibility with different operating systems. The discussion suggests that the software is well-received by the user and that the designer is open to addressing compatibility issues.

Notes: The conversation provides insights into the development and user experience of the physics simulation software. It highlights the importance of software compatibility and the designer's willingness to address user concerns. The discussion also suggests that the online community is actively engaged in providing feedback and seeking support for the software.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. P16: ＋1
2. P10: What does "+1" mean?
3. P11: It means "me too".
4. P13: +1 means the same opinion
5. P13: emmmm
6. P13: You can search on Baidu
7. P10: Oh, I see, thank you.
8. P2: +1
9. P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for.
10. P17: I'm just looking.
11. P4: No problem.

Here is a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research on how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

---
## Social Support
Definition: Instances of users showing agreement, appreciation, or acknowledgement of others' opinions or contributions.
- P16: ＋1
- P2: +1
- P13: +1 means the same opinion

---
## Information Seeking
Definition: Instances of users asking questions or seeking clarification on a topic.
- P10: What does "+1" mean?
- P10: Oh, I see, thank you.
- P13: emmmm (implying uncertainty or seeking clarification)

- P13: You can search on Baidu
- P4: No problem. (implying a response to an unspoken question or concern)

---
## Off-Topic Conversation
Definition: Instances of users introducing unrelated topics or comments that diverge from the main discussion.
- P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for.
- P17: I'm just looking.
(These comments seem unrelated to the initial discussion about the meaning of "+1")

---
## Community Norms
Definition: Instances of users referencing or establishing norms, rules, or expectations within the community.
- P13: +1 means the same opinion (implying a shared understanding within the community)

This codebook provides a starting point for analyzing the interaction and identifying factors that contribute to the emergence of Physics Lab's online community.

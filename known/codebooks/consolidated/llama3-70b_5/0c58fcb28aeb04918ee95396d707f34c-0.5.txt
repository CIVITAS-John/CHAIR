You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: reads generated code
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) Again, he reads the code and selectively copies code to the model.

2.
Label: human-ai: seek help
Quotes:
- E01: "can you verify that no more names are reserved words in NetLogo?" I don't know if it can do that. (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug after the third iteration, he asks ChatGPT to verify the code and produce no more bug. Unsure if it could do that.
- E01: If you know how to ask iterative questions, I think it could do pretty well. (interviewer's observation) E01 thinks ChatGPT would do well if one knows how to ask iterative questions.
- E04: "Can train-perceptron be turned into a reporter" (interviewer's observation) E04 uses "can you fix with my own idea".

3.
Label: observes adherence to best practices
Quotes:
- E04: It's basically following best practices. It is not trying to ruthlessly create a model. (interviewer's observation) Not "ruthlessly create a model".

4.
Label: ai ability (positive): translation
Quotes:
- E01: And you want doctors to use it, nurses to use it and medical transcriptionists to use it. They use a different word for whatever the verb for whatever it is you're saying you want them to do. And so, in some sense, their documentation has to be customized to their context to their user group. ... It's a language system. If you have a learning system that's actually capable of harvesting information, yeah, and a lot of them are not yet, but I think we'll get there. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to translate jargons between different sub-groups working in the same systems and ease the cost of writing customized documentation.

5.
Label: suggests ai generated solutions are better than no help
Quotes:
- E01: The problem I posted was about 100 pages of NetLogo and then 100 pages, 100 lines of NetLogo. And it was a real problem that I had looked at. I would love to help this person, but this is going to take me minimum of two hours to figure out what are they trying to do? (interviewer's observation) Although AI made mistake, E01 still believes in the value in having an AI-generated solution (compared with no solution or no help).

6.
Label: prioritizes efficiency
Quotes:
- E04: It'd be that I just take this and see what this does. This should just be a single node so it'll kind of overwrite what I already did. (interviewer's observation) E04 uses the AI-generated code completely when realizing time constraints.

7.
Label: engages in manual error correction
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E04 manually tries to fix the errors in the AI-generated code and did not choose "explain it".

8.
Label: identifies gaps in ai's code generation
Quotes:
- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

9.
Label: highlight need for better programming environments
Quotes:
- E01: And I got to admit like these days, NetLogo is the only language I use that does not have a smart editor. It doesn't autocomplete it or give me options of these are five variables that begin with those three letters. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's lack of smart code editors (we have one in TU that he would later see).

10.
Label: desires ai to improve learning processes
Quotes:
- E01: I cannot learn like that. I'm sorry. I am not a top left first page to last page. So if AI can help find a good place to start and manage that learning process, then I think that's astounding. (interviewer's observation) Critique on the existing situation of technical documentation and imagine that AI could improve the learning process.

11.
Label: human-ai (negative): human still need to double-check ai's suggestion
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

12.
Label: suggests collaborative learning
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

13.
Label: values clear instructions
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

14.
Label: human-effort (negative): debug. the interesting thing is about "conceptual error"
Quotes:
- E01: So I see this from beginners all the time is they, they just get totally lost. I call it lint program from Unix, you know, it's like it's a little green checkbox looks at you and go, okay, wait, it's just, you've spelled everything correctly, but you have a conceptual error here. If it, if it caught structural problems like that, that would, that would help. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo needs to have linting features that exist in other languages (we are working on that right now). Here, E01 wants the linting to support identifying conceptual mistakes, different from syntax mistakes which most linters work on.

15.
Label: describes confusion caused by vague errors
Quotes:
- E01: I think a lot of people, because they're very subtle, and then the error message is no help whatsoever to the user. You're, you're adding two variables over here and it's complaining about something over there. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's error messages could be unhelpful.

16.
Label: seeks further ai assistance
Quotes:
- E04: "how can I plot the output of this model?" (interviewer's observation) E04 was prompted to follow-up with ChatGPT.

18.
Label: reflects on interaction style
Quotes:
- E01: I speak to (ChatGPT) like a person. I could just walk in the room and go write me code that does X, but I don't, I start with good morning. And it comes back, but it comes back with good morning. How can I assist you today? It's pretty good at figuring out natural language. So in some sense that you might just be better off, just pretend it's not a computer. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how he interacts with ChatGPT like a person.

19.
Label: communicates clear project goals
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a simple feed-forward neural network in NetLogo with one hidden layer."

20.
Label: aims for clarity in instructions
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a simple perception" (interviewer's observation) Thinks a bit about whether to use "in NetLogo" or not.

21.
Label: considers chat gpt an outside observer
Quotes:
- E01: I don't know how much it understands about all of the efficiencies of NetLogo... But it (could) catch obvious errors that are not obvious to me. Even if it's relatively dumb, it's an outside observer, which is great. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could serve as an outside observer that points out errors human did not realize.

22.
Label: support novice
Quotes:
- E04: It includes debugging, it is actually trying to incorporate like a unit test, which is really cool and really helpful, especially for beginners, because they can kind of, you know, check their inputs. Beginners, everyone really. They can debug their code appropriately. (interviewer's observation) Debugging capability.
- E04: It seems to explain things pretty well, it does not seems to be overly technical. (interviewer's observation) Provides clear, less technical explanations.

23.
Label: reflects on ai's usability
Quotes:
- E04: It seems like it's, you know, pretty straightforward to use and like intuitive, which is nice. And it's like, it's easy to interact with. So I feel like if I had like enough time to play around with it, it could be like really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Straightforward to use and intuitive.

24.
Label: emphasizes preparatory exercises
Quotes:
- E01: Part of this, the user needs a little practice in debugging their own code. There should be some exercises before you ask GPT to do this.  (interviewer's observation) Users need practice in debugging their own code and need to have exercises before asking AI.

25.
Label: expresses a desire for tailored solutions
Quotes:
- E04: "Can train-perceptron be turned into a reporter" (interviewer's observation) E04 uses "can you fix with my own idea".

26.
Label: frustration point
Quotes:
- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.

27.
Label: suggests ai could encourage frequent help seeking
Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

28.
Label: recognize potential for overwhelming errors
Quotes:
- E01: I mean, it's like, write a line of code. Are there any errors? But, beginners will start and they write three pages of code and then they hit the green check mark.  (interviewer's observation) Beginners could write chunks of code and then find many errors that they cannot fix.

29.
Label: adopts ai generated code under time pressure
Quotes:
- E04: It'd be that I just take this and see what this does. This should just be a single node so it'll kind of overwrite what I already did. (interviewer's observation) E04 uses the AI-generated code completely when realizing time constraints.

30.
Label: notes the tendency to write large code chunks
Quotes:
- E01: I mean, it's like, write a line of code. Are there any errors? But, beginners will start and they write three pages of code and then they hit the green check mark.  (interviewer's observation) Beginners could write chunks of code and then find many errors that they cannot fix.

31.
Label: ability (positive): translating other progamming languages
Quotes:
- E04: I've found that AI is really helpful for like, translating other models from other languages into NetLogo, for example. (interviewer's observation) Helpful for translating from other languages into NetLogo

32.
Label: express willingness to assist others
Quotes:
- E01: The problem I posted was about 100 pages of NetLogo and then 100 pages, 100 lines of NetLogo. And it was a real problem that I had looked at.

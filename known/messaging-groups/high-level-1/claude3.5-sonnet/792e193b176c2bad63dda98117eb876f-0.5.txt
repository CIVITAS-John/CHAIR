Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label: A label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...
~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Here's a codebook based on the interaction, focusing on factors that could contribute to the emergence of Physics Lab's online community:

---
## User Engagement: Active participation and interest from users
Definition: Users showing enthusiasm, asking questions, or providing feedback about the product.
- "This idea is really good"
- "Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]"
- "But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing"

## Collaborative Design: Designers involving users in the development process
Definition: Designers seeking input, feedback, or preferences from users to inform design decisions.
- "When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group"
- "Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?"
- "So, use both?"

## Transparency: Designers sharing development progress and plans
Definition: Designers openly communicating about their work, upcoming features, or release schedules.
- "For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment"
- "We are working on this part"
- "There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend."

## Iterative Development: Continuous improvement based on feedback and testing
Definition: Designers making incremental changes and improvements to the product.
- "Make it simpler..."
- "This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only..."
- "The update is quite large..."

## Multi-platform Support: Developing for various devices and operating systems
Definition: Designers creating versions of the product for different platforms to reach a wider user base.
- "Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend."

## Visual Communication: Using images to convey ideas and seek feedback
Definition: Designers sharing visual representations of their work to facilitate understanding and discussion.
- "[Image 2-91]"
- "[Image 2-92] This one, right?"
- "[Image 2-102]"

## Gratitude and Commitment: Expressing appreciation and dedication to improvement
Definition: Designers acknowledging user contributions and committing to enhancing the product.
- "Thank you all for your support. We will do better!"

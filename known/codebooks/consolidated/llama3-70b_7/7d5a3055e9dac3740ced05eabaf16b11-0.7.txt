You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- User: Is there a user manual?

3.
Label: personal connection
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

4.
Label: request
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

5.
Label: explain intention of the app design
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

6.
Label: suggesting  checking compatibility of the system
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

7.
Label: make a suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

8.
Label: sharing identity per request
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

18.
Label: internal update
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

19.
Label: development update
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

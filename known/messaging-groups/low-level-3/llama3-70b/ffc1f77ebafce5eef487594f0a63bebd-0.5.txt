You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary tags: bidirectional conversion; diagram connection
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary tags: development approach; incremental refinement
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary tags: acknowledgement; feedback reception
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

Thoughts: In this conversation, I plan to analyze the emergence of Physics Lab's online community through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will examine how designers and users interact, share ideas, and refine concepts. I will explore how the designers' vision and users' feedback shape the development of Physics Lab. Guiding questions: How do designers and users collaborate to shape the direction of Physics Lab? How do they negotiate and refine ideas?

Summary: This conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab, with designers and users discussing ideas, refining concepts, and planning for future development. The designers share their vision, and users provide feedback, leading to a collaborative and iterative design process.

Notes: It appears that the designers are open to user feedback and willing to refine their ideas based on user input. The conversation is characterized by a sense of collaboration and mutual respect. The designers' enthusiasm for physics and chemistry is evident, and they are exploring ways to incorporate these subjects into Physics Lab. The use of visual aids, such as images, facilitates communication and idea exchange.

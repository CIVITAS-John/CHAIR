You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Keywords: electronic, multimeter, ammeter, batteries, meter

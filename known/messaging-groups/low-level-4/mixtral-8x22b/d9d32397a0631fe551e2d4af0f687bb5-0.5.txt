You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary phrases: requesting specific physics demonstrations; suggesting features to enhance the learning experience; engaging in participatory design
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary phrases: prioritizing development tasks; providing insight into the design and development process; managing user expectations
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary phrases: seeking community input on future development; emphasizing the importance of user feedback; demonstrating a commitment to participatory design
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: acknowledging the designers' efforts; expressing gratitude and support for the project
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about the pc/interactive whiteboard version of physics lab; seeking access to the platform; indicating interest in using physics lab
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: expressing gratitude for the provided resources; successfully accessing the desired version of physics lab; preparing to engage with the platform
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

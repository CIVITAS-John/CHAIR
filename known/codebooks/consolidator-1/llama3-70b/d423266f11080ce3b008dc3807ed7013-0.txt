You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

=> design considerations

* collaborative learning
* community formation
=> community development

# Reflection
Upon reviewing the draft merging plan, I noticed that:

* The categories "social atmosphere" and "social structure" are closely related and can be merged into "social dynamics", which concisely covers the aspects of social interactions within the online community.
* The categories "design facilitation" and "hci principles" can be merged into "design considerations", as they both relate to the design aspects of the online community.
* The categories "collaborative learning" and "community formation" can be merged into "community development", which encompasses the emergence of the online community.
* The categories "tool utilization" and "technical exchange" can be merged into "technical interaction", which covers the technical aspects of the online community.

However, I also identified some potential issues:

* The category "community development" might be too broad and could be split into more specific categories in the future.
* The category "design considerations" might benefit from further sub-categorization to distinguish between facilitation and principles.

# Final Merging

=> technical interaction

* social atmosphere
* social structure
=> social dynamics

* design facilitation
* hci principles
=> design considerations

* collaborative learning
* community formation
=> community development

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

2.
Label: development goals
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

3.
Label: apologize for timing
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

4.
Label: promise to make the feature on a later time
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

5.
Label: raise a concern for the new feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

6.
Label: give further information about the convesation

Label: teacher
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
- User: Yes.

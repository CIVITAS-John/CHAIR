You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: showing awareness
Quotes:
- User: ok

2.
Label: reassure users
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

3.
Label: confirm compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

4.
Label: details experimental features

5.
Label: exploring design possibilities
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

6.
Label: inquiring about platform specifics

11.
Label: seeking engagement
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

12.
Label: expand platform scope
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

13.
Label: building anticipation
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

16.
Label: delaying other tasks

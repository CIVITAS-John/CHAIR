2.
Label: notes incomplete ai responses
Quotes:
- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

3.
Label: prioritizes fixing
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 chooses to fix the problem rather than showing the explanation.

4.
Label: suspects bug in ai
Quotes:
- E04: It seems like a bug because I feel like all my parentheses are closed and all of my arguments and syntax are correct. (interviewer's observation) A less-clear error message makes E04 stuck.

5.
Label: reading the code and comments
Quotes:
- E01: So set up, move the turtle to go. Increase the size of the turtle by two units. Oh, dear. It's, it's making the turtle bigger. Oh, that's kind of, that's kind of messed it up a little bit then. (interviewer's observation) E01 reads the code and comments, summarizing the code, and thinks about how the AI was understanding the request.

6.
Label: forgets syntax and uses ai for assistance
Quotes:
- E04: Because I'll like forget the syntax sometimes and I usually use the netlogo dictionary and just have it like open to the side. (interviewer's observation) E04 still forgets about the syntax and ChatGPT can help.

7.
Label: demonstrates dictation of parameters during the coding process
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 dictated each of the parameter fields.

8.
Label: recognizing the cognitive limitations of users
Quotes:
- E01: So I would find it more helpful if it asked the questions one at a time. Before you tell me nine more errors. Just because users are always overfilling their buffer. So smaller requests work better. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests (for novice) only showing one error at a time in the AI-driven system.

9.
Label: learning curve demands high investment of time
Quotes:
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time.

(interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how AI could potentially serve as a pair programmer that questions the learners' motives.

12.
Label: highlighting the need for explicit problem conceptualization
Quotes:
- E01: In terms of learning experiences, like ramping up to using an assistant wrapping up to using ChatGPT might have some sort of evaluates. How well can you write instructions for another person?

18.
Label: proposing improvements for novice ai interaction
Quotes:
- E01: So I would find it more helpful if it asked the questions one at a time. Before you tell me nine more errors. Just because users are always overfilling their buffer.

19.
Label: reflecting on own code structure
Quotes:

Quotes:
- E01: I call it hive feedback system, where if anyone in the world learns a new fact, or like, Oh, if you're a nurse, here's the word. If you're a transcriptionist, here's the word. If anybody learns it, then it goes into the system into the cloud. And now the cloud won't make that mistake anymore. And then the developer doesn't have to solve all these problems, because all the users solve their own problems. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how the human-AI collaborative system could be used to increase general productivity.

24.
Label: critical thinking in ai interactions
Quotes:
- E04: Interesting because it's trying to plot the name, which I know is wrong, but I'm just trying to remember how to... (interviewer's observation) E04 reasons through the responses of ChatGPT.

25.
Label: time sensitive ai usage
Quotes:
- E04: It'd be that I just take this and see what this does. This should just be a single node so it'll kind of overwrite what I already did. (interviewer's observation) E04 uses the AI-generated code completely when realizing time constraints.

26.
Label: hive feedback system
Quotes:
- E01: I call it hive feedback system, where if anyone in the world learns a new fact, or like, Oh, if you're a nurse, here's the word. If you're a transcriptionist, here's the word. If anybody learns it, then it goes into the system into the cloud. And now the cloud won't make that mistake anymore. And then the developer doesn't have to solve all these problems, because all the users solve their own problems. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how the human-AI collaborative system could be used to increase general productivity.
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

27.
Label: indicates familiarity with chat gpt 3.5
Quotes:
- E04: I don't know if I've ever tried 4. I guess it would be 3.5. (interviewer's observation) Only used ChatGPT 3.5 before

28.
Label: early and often
Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

29.
Label: chooses not to use "explain it" option
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E04 manually tries to fix the errors in the AI-generated code and did not choose "explain it".

30.
Label: expressing frustration with ai's problem solving limits
Quotes:
- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.

31.
Label: observing the inconsistent and non deterministic nature of the ai's responses
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

32.
Label: valuing ai as an external observer
Quotes:
- E01: I don't know how much it understands about all of the efficiencies of NetLogo... But it (could) catch obvious errors that are not obvious to me. Even if it's relatively dumb, it's an outside observer, which is great. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could serve as an outside observer that points out errors human did not realize.

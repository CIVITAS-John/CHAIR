You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

* Summary
The conversation revolves around the design and development of Physics Lab, focusing on specific features related to electricity experiments, consultation with the community, and upcoming updates. Designer-1 seeks input on circuit diagram intersections, discusses the layout stability, and shares plans for an upcoming update. Users provide feedback and support throughout the conversation.

* Plan
Analyzing this conversation through the lens of learning sciences involves understanding how the design decisions, such as the simulated experiment assessment, align with educational principles. From a human-computer interaction perspective, examining user feedback on features like circuit diagram intersections and layout stability can provide insights into usability. In terms of participatory design, the consultation with the community and the response to user suggestions demonstrate a collaborative approach to development. Questions to consider include how the features align with educational goals, how users perceive the usability of the platform, and how the participatory design process influences community engagement.

- Contributor 12: The disparity in education between developing and developed countries. I agree that creating an online learning platform could help bridge this gap, offering both professional development for teachers and resources for students. However, I also understand Contributor 8's concern about accessibility and the motives behind technology sources. Governments in some countries might be wary of adopting foreign technology for cultural or political reasons. To truly promote equitable education globally, we need a collaborative approach where educational platforms are designed with input from local educators, respecting cultural differences. It’s not just about providing resources but also ensuring that they are accessible, relevant, and inclusive. Beyond online platforms, we should explore ways to address infrastructure issues in developing countries, such as limited internet access, by incorporating offline solutions or community-based initiatives. I'm thinking of Solar-powered Learning Kits. In areas where electricity is scarce, solar-powered educational kits can provide a sustainable way to access digital learning resources. These kits can include devices like solar-powered tablets with pre-installed educational content. Or focus on traditional media like radio and television to broadcast educational programs. This approach has been used successfully in various countries to reach students in remote areas. -

Label: reflect on ai feedback loop
Quotes:
- Contributor 24: Suggest examples of improvements
The tool can give you some fairly precise critique or suggestions for your work, but it currently does not give you examples of the kinds of improvements it wants. It would be interesting if it was able to do so, and maybe give you a headstart or a point of comparison. Of course, this opens up a whole slew of questions regarding authorship and idea generation.
 
Visibility on back end
The AI tool is not easily understood or interpreted by users in the sense that it makes decisions based on a back-end data set. However, it is difficult right now to trace how our inputs lead to the outputs. Enhancing the interpretability and transparency will help students understand why the output is giving us this feedback, and will probably increase adoption as our trust in the tool leading us in the right direction will increase.
 
Iterative feedback
It would be useful if the AI was able to take into account previous feedback and word/structure its followup feedback against this. For example, it could tell you how many improvements you've addressed or give you some other kind of marker regarding your progress.
 
Scaffold/Principle Specific Feedback
It may be helpful for the AI tool to provide feedback based on specific KB principles or scaffolds in order to narrow down the scope of what’s being talked about.

Label: critique ai facilitated assessment charts
Quotes:
- Contributor 19: Hi team. I've been thinking about our idea of an AI-facilitated, morphing assessment chart, and I'm developing some reservations and doubts about it. Of course, we were exploring the idea in the context that we all find ourselves in, but—in the spirit of improvable ideas—here are some concerns that I have, in relation to the principles of Knowledge Building: Reading up on the principles of KB once more, it looks like there is an emphasis not only on the epistemic agency of students charting their own learning course, but also about co-designing the analytics (and, by extension, some of the assessment) of their work. The notion of a rigid achievement chart hidden behind a adaptive lens is perhaps not the most intuitive.
   This second question of mine is perhaps a bit of a perpendicular reading of the KB principle, but I can't help but see a contradiction with the notion of community knowledge being informed by a generalist AI, trained on massive, globally proliferatted data. Would the AI be giving similar advice to students, regardless of their local (cultural, etc.) context? If so, does that take away from the community-level knowledge building?
Anyway, those are some of my thoughts on the matter! I'm sure I'll feel differently after a bit more thought, I was just in a critical mood today, I think!

I'm also interested in this subject. Children are shaped and impacted by their social surroundings; parents are, after all, their children's primary educators. Combining institutional and family initiatives is important to better promote KB. Involving parents improves their comprehension of successful learning techniques and fortifies the bond between the home and the school. By working together, we can create an atmosphere where kids flourish academically and personally, setting them up for success in a world that is always changing. 
   I have two additional issues that I would want to share after reading your proposals:

After the workshops, how can parents continue to discuss and put knowledge-building tactics into practice through a support network?
How could we guarantee that all families in the neighborhood, regardless of background or educational attainment, may participate in and benefit from these workshops?

- Contributor 11: To build on this group's discussions, it is imperitive to address the condition in which the groups are formed.

One way to extend this, would be to provide students with an opportunity to explore each topic before deciding on a group to ensure that they make an informed decision.    is that some students may choose a topic based on a friend's choice in order to work together.    having students submit their group choice privately, by having each student write down their group choice on paper and hand it to their teacher.  I believe that this should support    as students interact with each other in new ways, or interact with students they have not worked with before as . the division of topics, what if some groups are larger than others, what is some topics are not selected by any students.    students rank their topic choices and an algorithm develops the groups to ensure an even distruibution of students between the topics, while considering the student preferences?

Label: propose student engagement
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: Hi everyone,
This weekend I met the Indigenous artist Travis Shilling while visiting a friend in Orillia.  His father was Arthur Shilling, another prominent Indigenous artist.  It was an inspiring meeting, as I learned about a project that Travis has been working on in the Orillia area.  He has designed stainless steel easels that are set up at six different sites.   They are both sculptures and invitations to engage with the land through artistry.  You can read about Travis Shilling and see images of the easels at the website 'Sacred Site Easels (Link -> https://www.sacredsiteeasels.com/)'.
Travis passed along a couple of documents that also represent the project and I have attached images of those to this post.
I would really like to engage students with Travis' work, and hope that the Sacred Site Easels would inspire idea work, and take us deeper with respect to the idea of Indigenous relationships with the land, and potential innovation around that.
I welcome any ideas with respect to how to integrate this art initiative within our KB community.  I also wonder if it might inspire other ideas related to how to bring Indigenous perspectives into our work.

Label: reflect on project time constraints
Quotes:
- Contributor 19: Hi Contributor 31. Thanks for your feedback on our note, and for the follow up question. You are right, we perhaps didn't manage our time terribly effectively so we spent most of it writing out our thoughts on what was 'wrong' with the original project, from KB standpoint.
To your point about how students could be asked to iterate through their ideas in the project, I'm left thinking with what Prof. Scardamalia was mulling during the lecture: Can it be done in four days? There are different tools and approaches that can be used to make best use of that time, but I'm actually thinking about pushing back against that time constraint.
   In the spirit of this week's reading on interdisciplinary crisscrossing, the proposed project/topic might benefit from being spaced out over a long period of time. Integrating more subjects/curricula explicitly could help allocate more classroom time to it, but it might also be beneficial to simply spread out the same number of hours to shorter and periodic work sessions, while also tooling students to think, research, and design in between sessions. To me, such a setup would be much more fertile for iterative idea exploration. Broadening the scope of the project (or at least spacing out the structure a little bit) probably has more than a few implications, including specifically for the KB principle of Improvable Ideas: . Of course, all of this is easier said than done! Take for example the fact that many years ago I introduce a somewhat similar project on the development of the Portlands in Toronto (back when Google / Sidewalk Labs was still talking with the city). Since we were in a high school Geography class, the timetable basically dictated that this would be primarily/exclusively a geography assessment. There are stills ways to work within those confines, but sometimes we make the best of what we are given!

Improvement (KB Principles: Rise Above, Epistemic Agency):

Beyond simply linking sources, we could explore a collaborative learning space within the tool where users can annotate AI feedback, adding their own research insights or even collectively improve upon it. This creates a feedback loop where learners don't just passively receive information but actively build upon it. In addition, providing customizable checklists or templates for various types of responses would give users a scaffolded approach to self-assessment, fostering epistemic agency by encouraging users to think critically about what constitutes a 'complete' answer.

  Adding more scaffolds, such as 'compare perspectives' : The scaffold Compare perspectives encourage us to compare our ideas or notes with those of other classmates. We could use questions like 'What unique insights do your classmates provide?' or 'How does your interpretation differ from others?', which allows us to have meaningful conversations that foster critical thinking and a diversity of opinions.

Your group already touched on this when listing your wonderings however, I too, had the same wondering after reading your idea. I wonder if there is a way to offer the tool in multiple languages/ having a diverse team of educators such as the course we are taking right now. Having a team of diverse instructors with various backgrounds, will allow students to connect someone and see themselves respresented in their learning journey. Further, providing educators with extensive professional development training would allow them to follow a more culturally relevant and responsive approach to their teaching. is its potential ability to monitor student engagement. As educators, it is important to acknowledge that students have a variety of different learning preferences and some may not be very vocal in class. Offering a way for students to participate, while being able to monitor their engagement and interaction with peers through the use of AI/ other online technology could be amazing. When you mentioned , I agree that this is true however, during my own practicum placements, one of my associate teachers did use AI technology to create individualized success criteria for students. It did take time however, she took the time throughout the year to build relationships with her students, take notes on their progress and then she was able to input her notes and ask the AI to generate success criteria for each student based on their individual level and goals. when doing this individualized AI feedback, how can we ensure that the feedback/ the goals that students have, meet the standards in the Ontario curriculum. Overall, I really like all of the ideas that you presented and an 'invention' that I have which builds off of your post is to use an AI tool to generate feedback in multiple languages and mulitiple levels, taking into account the individual needs of students.

Quotes:
- Contributor 3: Sustainability in education and technology could refer to many different practices and strategies that ensure educational practices and technological systems are maintained in ways that benefit current and future generations without depleting resources or causing long-term harm to society, or even the environment. Our group had many different interpretations of what this could mean:Contributor 35: My mind immediately went to Data Privacy and Security. With the increase of digital platforms and online learning tools, student data privacy and security have become major concerns in schools and in fact, a concern for anyone using technology. There are serious concerns around data privacy and ethical usage, as we see more discourse on where we draw the lines, deeper conversation about digital literacy, and AI readiness. These concerns are particularly significant because education involves sensitive information about minors and vulnerable populations.Solution:
   In Knowledge Building, the community shares responsibility for advancing knowledge ('Collective Responsibility for Advancing Community Knowledge' (From Proto to Systemic Knowledge Building by Marlene Scardamalia). This principle can be applied as a solution by encouraging collective efforts across teams (e.g., AI developers, security experts, teachers, data scientists, and policymakers) to continuously update and refine AI security protocols.Encouraging collective efforts across different experts, to continuously update and refine AI and other learning tools is a sustainable way to leverage expert knowledge, and build these tools with human well-being and pedogogy in mind.  
Contributor 37: From a designer’s perspective, the educational sustainability issue that first comes to mind is the use of eco-friendly materials in the classroom. Contributor 28 has also mentioned the knowledge and ways of thinking needed to achieve economic prosperity. Building on this, technology could serve as a powerful solution for reducing the physical costs of classroom activities by transitioning to digital resources that minimize paper waste and energy consumption. 
In addition, I think accessibility in education also involves considering social sustainability and ensuring that learning tools and environments are inclusive of different languages, cultural perspectives, and learning needs.
Solution: using technology, the knowledge could be built into dynamic, recyclable and expandable learning modules/communities.  And from this perspective we could use encourage students to share diverse viewpoints on sustainability practices and design solutions that cater to different needs.
Yuqi:Technology and education involve the interaction between humans and computers. When considering sustainability in technology and education, we should consider both the sustainable use of technology and the sustainability of human resources and societal systems.
Contributor 30:    During our conversation about technology and school sustainability, we touched on a number of crucial topics. The growing worry over data privacy was one important factor, especially in light of the increased use of digital platforms in education. We also discussed the necessity of responsible tech use in the classroom, meaning pupils use it for meaningful learning rather than just busy work, and the shift to digital materials to cut down on waste. Another hot topic was accessibility, since not every student has equal access to technology, which might make it difficult to create a fair learning environment. When taken as a whole, these observations show how important it is to approach the sustainable integration of technology in education with caution and moderation.Contributor 28: Technology in Education; can refer to many facets of teaching/learning provided that technology is present is some shape or form. EX the SAMR model (Substitution, Aumentation, Modification, Redefinition) once youve figured out your discourse and how to use your technology responsibly I beelive that it can be a huge support in teaching. Furthermore the sustainability comes to reposnible usage of the tech in the classsroom and the preparedness of the students to use if responsibly. Some possible drawbacks to technology in education would strictly be due to accessibility issues. how available is the tech, are there pay walls and can each and every student use it regardless of economic background.    the SAMR model was shared acroos the board and not just in educational fields allowing for anyone implementing tech in educations to really thing about the way the use technology in an educational format that can support students and not just 'busy work' Contributor 10: Professional development immediately comes to mind. I believe that we must first equip educational practitioners in order to achieve the sustainability of education and technology. If they could not successfully incorporate these theories and have access to ongoing technologies and practices, how could they pass this to their students in learning process?

Quotes:
- Contributor 9: I really like this groups idea of incorporating music into physical education class in order to increase students engagement. I agree that by playing popular songs, this might increase students energy levels and interest if they like that particular song. I also agree that students might become more engaged by incorporating gamified learning. This is a very interesting concept, however, I think the student themselves need to be interested in this way of learning, otherwise it will not increase their engagement. Furthermore, I think the most important way to increase students engagement would be as this group mentioned, building a relationship with the students. Typically, students will not engage if they are not interested in what they are learning or the activity they are doing. The way to learn about these interests is through building a relation with the student and learning what they enjoy. This way, they can create personalized plans to help encourage each student to participate.

A select number of teachers can participate in these types of workshops. Also a traveling group can also go to different schools to provide resources for schools if that is deemed helpful for them.  -

Label: advocate for culturally inclusive curricula
Quotes:
- Contributor 8: In order to make a consideration for pedagogical approaches for sustainability, the designs should, above all, promote a long-term, flexible and reliable educational practices. The ways of approaching these sustainable goals in pedagogy could include the following:

 Adopting cultural inclusive currila.    this could be done by ensuring that the content in the curriculum is culturally accomodative inrorder to promote inclusivity and equity. This is important since diverse students get a sense of belonging by klnowing they are seen and felt through the rep[resentation of their norms in the content taught.This would promte longterm engagement.

Label: suggest team formation adjustments
Quotes:
- Contributor 32: Here are our thoughts on what aspects of the STEM challenge are at odds with Knowledge Building, and some toughts on how to address these issues.

'Learn first, produce later' assumption

Both      and      are relevant here. In true Knowledge Building, learning happens through the authentic production of new knowledge.
   Students should be determine and adjust what are the important concepts, rather than being told what is crucial knowledge. True Knoweldge Building must creative knowledge work, contribute to communcal knowledge.
Reflect meaningfully and in dialogue with others on the integration of Indigenous knowledge.


team formation only happens after original learning takes place

   Team-building should happen in the initial stages, and there should be a mix of achievement levels. teams are assigned a specifc aspect of urban design

   We would prefer students to have more epistemic agency when it comes to narrowing down what aspect they want to work on. all the work is segmented, everyone is assigned a specific roles; no opportunistic collaboration

   Everything should be shared, and everyone should have equal access to what is being produced. Knowledge building in a group setting should involve contributions from all members, the learning is mutually beneficial. Students should be able to improve on each other's ideas, instead of being confined to one subject matter. Assessment should reflect the group, and not individual contributions. We suggest having touchstones and crosstalks between groups mediated/modelled by teacher as needed.

Further, this could be implemented through . For example, having students go into their community and interviewing community members/ Indigenous elders (if this is an option) in order to gain insights from people who have lived through these experiences.could also be to introduce . This would look like introducing students to . Students could examine articles that are already produced by experts and then challenge and look for 'gaps' that they could work on filling in the expert work. Encouraging students to  will also be useful in other areas of their schooling and beyond school as well. Examining information and literature critically will provide students with the opportunity to be critical about what they are actually using from what they have access to. In order to do this, students could take notes as they read and document any questions they may have, any suggestions that arise and annotate the literature they are examining. This may be more beneficial for older students unless younger students are given simpler texts/articles to annotate. Annotations allow students to record their thoughts and ideas in that moment which is beneficial to Knowledge Building. is also something that could apply in this project because as mentioned by Contributor 25, . I think this is a fantastic idea and it would allow the knowledge and ideas that students develop to become more widespread. Posting the student presentations on an online database so that community members have access to viewing the ideas presented by students could be an effective way to foster new ideas within a community and share knowledge. Students and Parents could join a 'communtiy' and even use a platform like Knowledge Forum where they would be able to build off of the ideas of students and contribute to the collective goal. -

Label: address educational disparity
Quotes:
- Contributor 12: The disparity in education between developing and developed countries. I agree that creating an online learning platform could help bridge this gap, offering both professional development for teachers and resources for students. However, I also understand Contributor 8's concern about accessibility and the motives behind technology sources. Governments in some countries might be wary of adopting foreign technology for cultural or political reasons. To truly promote equitable education globally, we need a collaborative approach where educational platforms are designed with input from local educators, respecting cultural differences. It’s not just about providing resources but also ensuring that they are accessible, relevant, and inclusive. Beyond online platforms, we should explore ways to address infrastructure issues in developing countries, such as limited internet access, by incorporating offline solutions or community-based initiatives. I'm thinking of Solar-powered Learning Kits. In areas where electricity is scarce, solar-powered educational kits can provide a sustainable way to access digital learning resources. These kits can include devices like solar-powered tablets with pre-installed educational content. Or focus on traditional media like radio and television to broadcast educational programs. This approach has been used successfully in various countries to reach students in remote areas. -

Label: suggest customized feedback
Quotes:
- Contributor 21: One weakness with this AI feedback tool is that it does not fully understand the specific details or personal perferences. This can lead to responses which might not be fully aligned with our personal needs or expectations for a response. It also does not have any emotional understanding or empathy which one may find in a human feedback provider. This can limit the effectiveness of its' responses to the individual. Contributor 9 Razaiy Contributor 28   AI Often have several limitations and do not always have all the answers. Having the AI link where it pulled its information from allowing you access it and further research on your own would be a great improvemnet. Also when generating feedback provide examples of what a 'complete answer may look like or a checklist of what may be missing from your answer. Examining how the AI might adjust to individual tastes by gaining knowledge from user input over time and providing more customized feedback is a fresh perspective on this. Additionally, it might offer direct connections to the information's original sources, enabling readers to go further and independently confirm the data. A set of guidelines or checklist that provides examples of strong responses would also be helpful in providing more precise suggestions on how to get better. By including these functions, the AI may be able to encourage a more deliberate and introspective learning process rather than just providing rapid feedback. Ting I can receive quick feedback from AI to see how my assignment is coming along. You can also examine the issues that surface in other students' schoolwork at the same time.
  I notice that there are three scaffolds: 'How do I start?', 'Reflect on our discourse', and 'Plan for deeper work'. we add more to better guide us in thinking and make the feedback more productive? For example, to contrast or compare different notes, etc.  so that it could also be used to boost more exchange between the ideas.

Label: draw environment analogy
Quotes:
- Contributor 19: Hi folks. Just wanted to make a quick note on how interesting I think your definition of (lack of) sustainability is: 
I would imagine most people would associate the term sustainability first-and-foremost (and perhaps exclusively) with the environment. I might have a bit of a bias here given my background in Biology, but I would say that's also the case in my other background: Political Science.
I find it interesting not only that you include the idea of avoiding harm to society, but also that you put it first. I feel like we can run with that analogy/comparison even further. Like the environment, there will still be an environment left no matter how poorly we manage the globe, it might just be a polluted, toxic wasteland. Similarly, there will certainly be society in the future, but we may do lasting harm to it if we are not careful.
Sorry I'm not building on your designs, but I thought that was fascinating! Thanks for that!

Label: implement an adaptable achievement chart
Quotes:
- Contributor 1: An achievement chart in most flexible implementation, allowing multi-faceted feedback to connect directly to the principle of addressing challenges as a knowledge-building community. In using Artificial Intelligence in such a way, the rubric criteria are slowly introduced as the student pro-actively engages with their own learning process, to allow them to find and meet their own challenges in real time. This dynamic procedure nurtures not only a sense of community, but also assures that students are constantly engaged in reflections and improvements of their contributions toward an advance in group knowledge. Nowadays, the achievement charts is that there very restrictive and narrow-minded. These are requested and expected in the educational processes in the classrooms.  the achievement chart was adaptable the student's progress? A question we still have is how can this idea can work in a group setting? Would all student receive the same feeback and guidelines?
 
After our first brainstorm iteration, we have gone back and thought about such a tool from a sustainability perspective. Two wonderings came from this:

Could such a tool help students who are otherwise 'invisible' or missed by teachers to get prompt and useful feedback. In a classroom of 30 students, some students's needs will inevitably get more attention than others.
Could such a tool re-entrench access issues, if it is not culturally responsive/diverse, and thus is more adapted to interface with certain students?

Label: emphasize real world challenges
Quotes:
- Contributor 34: Encourage students to represent their ideas in multiple forms—drawings, models, graphs, and narratives—to expand the problem space. Have students create diverse artefacts, such as concept maps of sustainable city features, infographics about energy sources, or artistic depictions of future cities. Use these artefacts to explore contrasting ideas and perspectives, driving collective understanding forward. Let students decide on the specific aspects of sustainable cities they want to explore, such as green energy, waste management, or building materials. Allow them to monitor their progress, set new directions, and share their findings with the class and the broader community. Introduce a “Sustainable City Symposium” where students regularly present their evolving ideas, receive critical feedback, and reflect on progress. Encourage them to connect their discussions to historical, cultural, and Indigenous perspectives on land use and urban development. Encourage students to look beyond superficial solutions to explore the deeper, interacting systems involved in urban sustainability, such as energy use, building materials, and cultural beliefs. Students might research how urban design affects the environment and connect building rocks and minerals to energy sources utilized in cities.
   Use collaborative digital tools (like a shared online forum) where every student can post their thoughts, questions, and resources.  Make it a classroom norm to engage thoughtfully with each contribution, magnifying the value of diverse perspectives.
   Move from static project designs to a dynamic and evolving inquiry in which students' ideas are treated as improvable, by having them develop initial designs for sustainable cities, then revisiting and refining them in light of new insights, peer feedback, and research on energy and environmental resources. This could also enable them to use Indigenous knowledge and traditional ecological wisdom to rethink aspects of their design entailing material use, energy consumption, and land stewardship.
   Frame the exploration in real-world challenges that cities are facing today, such as urban sprawl, energy consumption, and access to sustainable materials. Allow students to research and bring in case studies from Indigenous perspectives on land use and resource management.Students may explore questions like, 'How can we use city energies without harming the environment?' or 'What might we learn from traditional Indigenous ways in regard to using rocks and minerals sustainably?

Label: discuss parental involvement in education
Quotes:
- Contributor 10: Thank for your share. 
I'm also interested in this subject. Children are shaped and impacted by their social surroundings; parents are, after all, their children's primary educators. Combining institutional and family initiatives is important to better promote KB. Involving parents improves their comprehension of successful learning techniques and fortifies the bond between the home and the school. By working together, we can create an atmosphere where kids flourish academically and personally, setting them up for success in a world that is always changing. 
   I have two additional issues that I would want to share after reading your proposals:

After the workshops, how can parents continue to discuss and put knowledge-building tactics into practice through a support network?
How could we guarantee that all families in the neighborhood, regardless of background or educational attainment, may participate in and benefit from these workshops?

Label: encourage student interest expression
Quotes:
- Contributor 33: Encouraging students to express their interests on the first day, rather than presenting predefined sustainability problems, enhances epistemic agency. Having students work in their groups of interest will allow them to focus on different aspects of the curriculum while also learning about something that they are very passionate about. This approach empowers students to take ownership of their learning by allowing them to choose areas of focus that resonate with them. It fosters greater engagement, as students are more likely to invest in topics they feel connected to. This type of work also shows students that their ideas are valued and that they have control over their learning. This strategy not only aligns with knowledge building principles but also helps cultivate a more dynamic and participatory classroom environment. Another important aspect to emphasize is the principle of constructive use of authoritative sources during student research. Encourage students not to avoid complex knowledge sources and to appreciate expert opinions. However, they should also recognize the value of personal experiences and insights that may not be readily available online. This approach fosters a more holistic understanding of sustainability, allowing students to integrate various forms of knowledge and perspectives into their projects, ultimately enriching their learning experience and community discussions.
 Incorporating diverse perspectives, such as those of elders or Indigenous communities, into the study of sustainable practices encourages students to look beyond immediate sources of information. It is essential that we look to authentic sources for information and not try to retell their lived experiences through our own perspectives. This aligns with the principle of idea diversity and promotes a deeper understanding of how to use the land sustainably. Additionally, valuing peer feedback allows students to reflect on their own viewpoints, fostering a collaborative learning environment where multiple ideas can coexist and enhance the community's overall knowledge base.
 Encouraging students to tackle real ideas and authentic problems within their own community, rather than focusing on a random city, significantly enhances engagement and relevance. This approach allows them to apply their learning directly to their surroundings, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility. By addressing local challenges, students can explore sustainable practices that impact their lives and the lives of those around them, leading to meaningful contributions and a deeper understanding of community dynamics. This alignment with local issues promotes both motivation and practical knowledge application. Further, having students think of ideas and how to enhance and work with Indigenous communities could be a great way to get them more involved with learning how to preserve the land and be more cautious




 Through an approach such as this one, students have to take ownership of their own learning and their contributions to the broader community. Having students then present their findings and ideas to the class or other small groups in a seminar type of formation in the class. -

Label: address parental involvement
Quotes:
- Contributor 4: Workshops: Schools can host knowledge building information workshops which emphasize the importance of knowledge building. The goal is to raise awareness on what knowledge building is, foster an environement at home where knowledge can be built. Teach parents teaching for learning vs teaching for understanding. Different institutions can also host these workshops where learning is happening for children. 
Applicable to real life situation: challenge in schools in China parents want academic improvement in children, they do not put importance on extracirricular activities. They are not aware of how these activities can help them with holistic growth (another way of knoweldge buikding). Knowledge building is not restricted to school environements, it can happen in various environments where children need to go. 
Sustainability of Workshops: We must make sure the workshops can go on for a long period of time. They should not just end after a short period of time. Ways we can achieve this would be to offer these workshops using different delivery methods (in person, online). It could also be something that is brought up in student/teacher interviews. This is applicable if teachers are also involved in the knowledge building process. It is important that the workshops themselves are presented using knowledge building and not traditional teaching.

Label: discuss indigenous artist project
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: Hi everyone,
This weekend I met the Indigenous artist Travis Shilling while visiting a friend in Orillia.  His father was Arthur Shilling, another prominent Indigenous artist.  It was an inspiring meeting, as I learned about a project that Travis has been working on in the Orillia area.  He has designed stainless steel easels that are set up at six different sites.   They are both sculptures and invitations to engage with the land through artistry.  You can read about Travis Shilling and see images of the easels at the website 'Sacred Site Easels (Link -> https://www.sacredsiteeasels.com/)'.
Travis passed along a couple of documents that also represent the project and I have attached images of those to this post.
I would really like to engage students with Travis' work, and hope that the Sacred Site Easels would inspire idea work, and take us deeper with respect to the idea of Indigenous relationships with the land, and potential innovation around that.
I welcome any ideas with respect to how to integrate this art initiative within our KB community.  I also wonder if it might inspire other ideas related to how to bring Indigenous perspectives into our work.

Quotes:
- Contributor 9: I really like this groups idea of incorporating music into physical education class in order to increase students engagement. I agree that by playing popular songs, this might increase students energy levels and interest if they like that particular song. I also agree that students might become more engaged by incorporating gamified learning. This is a very interesting concept, however, I think the student themselves need to be interested in this way of learning, otherwise it will not increase their engagement. Furthermore, I think the most important way to increase students engagement would be as this group mentioned, building a relationship with the students. Typically, students will not engage if they are not interested in what they are learning or the activity they are doing. The way to learn about these interests is through building a relation with the student and learning what they enjoy. This way, they can create personalized plans to help encourage each student to participate.

Quotes:
- Contributor 17: Your proposal for workshops to promote knowledge building is an exciting approach that addresses the essential need for parental engagement in education. As we know, not all parents are able to be extremely involved with what their children are doing at school.
  To progress this initiative, I propose a Knowledge Sharing Community App designed to allow parents to engage from the comfort of their own homes/spaces and on their own time. This app could be used on smartphones, tablets and online websites. It would foster continuous involvement from the community. Think of it as a very large group chat of sorts where parents and other community members can share videos, events, extracurricular activity ideas, and the recordings of those workshops that you spoke about in your post. This could allow parents to watch these recordings on their own time. Additionally, following these workshops, parents could leave feedback about the session and suggestions for future sessions. This promotes knowledge building as it allows for a multitude of different perspectives. An app that encompasses all of these different facets of education, has the potential to increase engagement and motivation from the wider parental community. A potential limitation with this could be that parents could still opt to not participate in the app however, having it on a mobile app could really increase engagement from parents because it is more accessible. -

- Contributor 31: What are people's thoughts about ways to integrate AI into a Knowledge Building process related to designing a sustainable city?
Over the past few years I have used ChatGPT to generate a source related to topics we are working on in class.  I find that some of the advanced vocabulary of other sources alienates some readers, and even though we want them to work through challenging texts, there seems to be a sweet spot for the extent of challenge that works without losing engagement.
When I asked ChatGPT to tell me about strategies for creating sustainable urban design using vocabulary suitable for a 9 year old, it provided this response:
Cities around the world are making changes to be more environmentally friendly and protect nature. Here are some ways they are doing it:
 
 **Building Green Spaces**: Cities are creating more parks, gardens, and areas with trees and plants. These green spaces help clean the air, provide homes for animals, and give people a place to enjoy nature.

 **Using Renewable Energy**: Instead of using fuels that pollute the air, some cities are using *renewable energy* sources like wind, water, and sunlight to power homes and buildings. This helps reduce pollution.


 **Encouraging Public Transportation**: Cities are making it easier for people to take buses, trains, or ride bikes instead of using cars. This reduces the number of cars on the road, which means less pollution and cleaner air.

 **Creating Bike and Walking Paths**: Many cities are building safe paths for people to bike and walk. This encourages people to get around without using cars, which is better for the environment.


 **Installing Rooftop Gardens**: Some buildings have gardens on their rooftops! These *rooftop gardens* help keep the buildings cooler, save energy, and provide a nice place for insects and birds.

 

 **Collecting Rainwater**: Some cities have special systems to collect and store rainwater. This water can be used for things like watering gardens or cleaning streets, which saves drinking water.

 
These features help cities take care of the environment, making them better places to live for people, animals, and plants.

What do people think of using a text like this?  Could each section be used as an area for idea improvement? On the other hand is it too prescriptive to start with something like this?
I am also wondering what other applications of AI might work in our context.  We have experimented a bit with schoolai.com, where students can discuss topics with AI.  I am not sure how we could cite that as a source, or use it intentionally in the process.
Any ideas related to using AI in our design are welcome!

Label: propose annotation process
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: I like the suggestion of annotating sources, and this could work with Grade 4 and 5 students, depending on the source.  I am thinking of starting with something simple and then moving to more expert sources as we progress, and as the students find them.  (One of the students is already coming to chat with me at recess about Stanley Meyer, who he says invented a hydrogen car and died mysteriously.  I am not sure how 'mysteries' like this will fit into this work but there is probably a place for critically analyzing them!)
To start I might create a note like this, which has a copy of the text from this website 
Knowledge Forum has an annotation feature, which I am showing in this screenshot:

Hopefully you can see how some text is highlighted near the bottom and there is space for an annotation.
We will use other sources as well but they can't all be pasted into a note like this, particularly if they are from hard copy books or even digital books.  
I am thinking that annotation could support this facet of the Proto-to-Systemic KB principles: 

I also think the students could work in a view where they cite the reading material and use it to improve designs, like we do in this course.  
I would love to hear any suggestions about how to structure the annotation process or about any possible scaffolds to support reading for design, or constructive use of authoritative sources with this age group.
Thanks for the inspiration!

Quotes:
- Contributor 12: I completely agree that a field trip would be an excellent way to make the concept of sustainability more tangible for the students. Engaging with eco-friendly spaces and participating in hands-on activities like gardening or tree planting would definitely give them a deeper, more personal connection to the subject.  It would also be a great opportunity for students to see how their learning can make a real difference in their community.

Quotes:
- Contributor 19: That sounds like fun! I'll take this opportunity to make a brief aside about the potential benefits for teachers to think along the lines of KB... it certainly seems like it would be a bit revitalizing and a nice change of pace! Of course, it's easier to assume things going well than things not going well. I would imagine some growing pains, but again, it's exciting just to hear your ideas on how students could be zipping around!

Label: emphasize relationship building
Quotes:
- Contributor 2: Main problem: students are having a hard time staying engaged and have trouble finding motivation to complete and interact with the course content.
Solutions
1. Part of my research for the MT program at OISE looks at increasing student motivation and engagement specifically in Physical Education classes via the use of music integration. I believe that by using music in the class while facilitating games or exercises for your students can greatly increase their motivation and make the class more fun. This increases their engagement especially if they are listening to music that they like. Think of it like going to the gym to workout most people go to workout and listen to music at the same time.
2. Another way to improve student engagement and motivation would be to incorporate gamified learning. Students can begin to learn by playing games that aim to touch on the learning goal for that period. Students can be offered points or rewards for adopting sustainable behaviours or solving problems. This can foster friendly and healthy competition and promote fun in learning new things
3. Another method to increase student engagement is through relationship building. Teachers need to actively try to engage with students and make efforts to get to know them so that they know how to best guide each student on their learning journey. Taking the time to get to know students is acccessible and sustainable to all and goes a long way :)
We also think that this problem relates to this facet . This is because we believe that one of the key factors to improving student engagement and motivation is to build strong relationships with students and safe classroom environments. This will help students feel comfortable in their learning environment and more welcome in the classroom.

Quotes:
- Contributor 32: Here are our thoughts on what aspects of the STEM challenge are at odds with Knowledge Building, and some toughts on how to address these issues.

'Learn first, produce later' assumption

Both      and      are relevant here. In true Knowledge Building, learning happens through the authentic production of new knowledge.
   Students should be determine and adjust what are the important concepts, rather than being told what is crucial knowledge. True Knoweldge Building must creative knowledge work, contribute to communcal knowledge.
Reflect meaningfully and in dialogue with others on the integration of Indigenous knowledge.


team formation only happens after original learning takes place

   Team-building should happen in the initial stages, and there should be a mix of achievement levels. teams are assigned a specifc aspect of urban design

   We would prefer students to have more epistemic agency when it comes to narrowing down what aspect they want to work on. all the work is segmented, everyone is assigned a specific roles; no opportunistic collaboration

   Everything should be shared, and everyone should have equal access to what is being produced. Knowledge building in a group setting should involve contributions from all members, the learning is mutually beneficial. Students should be able to improve on each other's ideas, instead of being confined to one subject matter. Assessment should reflect the group, and not individual contributions. We suggest having touchstones and crosstalks between groups mediated/modelled by teacher as needed.


formative feedback rolling throughout
   students are not given an opportunity to iterate through their ideas -

Quotes:
- Contributor 31: Hello team!
Your note is a substantial critique of the original project, keeping KB principles in mind.
I noticed that when you addressed Improvable Ideas you mentioned that 
I wonder what sort of specific classroom structues you would imagine can support an iterative process in the context of Knowledge Building.  How could this be supported in the context of addressing sustainable urban design?  What tools or routines might be put in place to highlight iterations and support their advancement towards new designs?

Label: emphasize inquiry groups
Quotes:
- Contributor 8: I loved the question from Contributor 9 about the traditional filed trip in the sustainability and I thought about the need for learners to get facilitation from the teachers on the need to brainstorm the expactations of the traditional filed trip with a focus on curriculum related issues while generating ides and setting the golas ahead of their trip by forming inquiry groups that are tasked with research topics on respective group's goals.
During the traditional trip this is where the students exercise the principle of    by actively answering their pre-trip questions through discussing in their previously formed groups.

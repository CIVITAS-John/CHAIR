1. P2: What about superconductors?
Preliminary tags: superconductors; curiosity; exploration
2. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
Preliminary tags: chemistry experiments; simulation; computational power
3. P1: If you can create a comprehensive and free software, it should be very popular.
Preliminary tags: comprehensive software; popularity; potential
4. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's game over.
5. P11: If you include all these, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
7. P11: Hey, good idea
8. P2: Hehe
9. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
10. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
11. Designer: The question is
12. Designer: Where does the light come from?
13. P11: What about light?
14. Designer: Are you shining a light bulb on a photosensitive resistor?
15. P2: Touch by hand
16. P14: I think there's no problem
17. Designer: Then it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
18. P2: With Xiaodeng
19. Designer: Microtransactions...
20. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
21. P2: ï¼Ÿ
22. P14: [Image 245]
23. Designer: Let's talk about it later
24. Designer: Can watch ads even without money
25. Designer: The practice of a conscience game
26. P1: Put up ads
27. Designer: Hmm.
28. P2: It doesn't conduct electricity when you touch it
29. Designer: Oh
30. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (...)
31. P11: ðŸ˜‚
32. P11: Just wanted to say
33. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but I simply don't know how to top up
34. P11: Can also adapt to 3D Touch
35. Designer: Can you top up directly on the app store?

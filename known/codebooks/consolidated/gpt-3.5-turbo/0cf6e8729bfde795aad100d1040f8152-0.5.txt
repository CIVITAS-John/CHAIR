You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not write repetitive ones.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

- I saw the files in the group, thank you.

6.
Label: software development
Quotes:
- Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to install a virtual machine.

7.
Label: participatory design
Quotes:
- We will also update the multimeter and energized screwdriver this week. If there are any features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group. We will try our best to consider them. Saving experiments to the cloud/local storage, as mentioned before, is also in the plan. Thank you all!
- If there could be an export function, or save and import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set the parameters in the office and import them directly in class.
- Okay. Please give more suggestions!

- # New Features
Electronic components will now be damaged after a brief process, rather than immediately. 
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface. 
Support for undoing wire and component creation and deletion. 
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current. 
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.
- Hmm... I'll add that in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, there might be another round this weekend.
- Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been uploaded to the group files, with the following updates:

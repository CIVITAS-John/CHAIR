You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: development roadmap, development timeline
- Discussion of software development roadmap or timeline.
- Timelines or schedules for development or release.

2.
Concepts: information seeking, information inquiry
- Users asking questions to gain knowledge or resources related to the software.
- Users ask questions to seek information or clarification, seeking guidance on downloading specific versions.

3.
Concepts: feature requests, content request
- User proposes a new feature or functionality, suggesting or requesting new features or functionalities.
- A user makes a request or suggests a feature for the project, requesting new content, features, or functionalities.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: development roadmap, development timeline
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts refer to the planning and scheduling of software development)
Criteria: Discussion of software development roadmap or timeline, including timelines or schedules for development or release.
Label: Development Planning

2.
Concepts: information seeking, information inquiry
Relationship: Inclusion (information inquiry is a type of information seeking)
Criteria: Users ask questions to gain knowledge or resources related to the software, seeking guidance or clarification on specific topics.
Label: Information Gathering

3.
Concepts: feature requests, content request
Relationship: Inclusion (content request is a type of feature request)
Criteria: Users propose new features or functionalities, requesting new content, features, or functionalities for the project.
Label: Feature Suggestion

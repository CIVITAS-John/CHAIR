You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: explain educational focus
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

2.
Label: highlight user needs for modern technology
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

3.
Label: confirm understanding of design elements
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

4.
Label: open to alternatives
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

5.
Label: affirm community knowledge about circuit diagram styles
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

6.
Label: request assistance with avatar customization
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

7.
Label: designer 1 inquires about user's profession
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

8.
Label: product gap
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

9.
Label: confirm successful navigation of shared files
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

10.
Label: acknowledgement
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- User: [Emoji]
- User: This idea is really good
- Designer: There will be.

11.

14.
Label: explain limitations of current input methods
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

15.
Label: raise considerations for software interface
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

16.
Label: sought technical support
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

17.
Label: request user manual
Quotes:
- User: Is there a user manual?

18.
Label: express urgency
Quotes:
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?

19.
Label: contribute knowledge about circuit diagram styles
Quotes:
- User: Left side

20.
Label: list bug fixes
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

21.
Label: consider local export functionality

Label: designer 1 acknowledges user
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
- Designer: Hello :)

23.
Label: encouraged user suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

24.

25.
Label: provided affirmation
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

26.
Label: engaged in non verbal communication
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

27.
Label: validate user assumptions
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

28.
Label: user 4232 considers touch screen usability

30.
Label: requested specific content
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference?

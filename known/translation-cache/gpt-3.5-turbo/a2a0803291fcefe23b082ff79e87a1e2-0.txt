~~~
1. 因为试管坏了
---
2. 怎么说？
---
3. 试管比较好，受热快，用料省。但是这个也没问题，土豪一点拿个鱼缸上面盖起来接个管子也可以嘛😂
---
4. 冷凝的液体不会倒流的么
---
5. 因为体积大，回流时候的液体已经被加热，不容易破裂
---
6. 噢噢噢
---
7. chemist应该没太考虑器具
---
8. 不过化学事情太多，估计下半年之前不可能去碰..
---
9. 事实上也不必要和书本中完全相同，虽然考试的时候...
---
10. 目前还没有什么比较真实的化学软件吧
---
11. 记得有个专业软件还好
---
12. 但有机神仙都解决不了
---
13. 所以要做主要还是从考试角度考虑了
---
14. 非标准的操作支持，但会标记出来（电学下一段就会有，比如带电操作）
---
15. 好
---
16. 超导体呢
---
17. 我猜想化学实验变量太多，所以模拟起来需要更大的运算量...
---
18. 你如果有能力搞个不付费又很全的应该很受欢迎淫
---
19. CPU不好就玩完了
---
20. 加你说的这些进去，就不是“Physics Lab”了😂
---
21. 实验课系列嘛
---
22. 诶好主意
---
23. 呵呵
---
24. ...难道你不知道说呵呵是很欠揍的吗
---
25. @3 光感元件能加吗
---
26. 问题是
---
27. 光从哪里来
---
28. 光呢
---
29. 你用小灯泡照光敏电阻吗
---
30. 手点
---
31. 我觉得没毛病
---
32. 那不就是一个滑变，除了曲线不一样（……）
===
1. Because the test tube is broken
---
2. How do you say?
---
3. Test tubes are better, heat up quickly, and are cost-effective. But it's also fine, you can be a bit extravagant and cover a fish tank with a tube on top 😂
---
4. Will the condensed liquid not flow back?
---
5. Because of the large volume, the liquid that flows back has already been heated, so it's less likely to cause breakage.
---
6. Oh oh oh
---
7. The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much.
---
8. But there are too many chemistry-related things, I probably won't be able to touch them before the second half of the year...
---
9. In fact, it's not necessary to be completely identical to the textbook, even during exams...
---
10. There doesn't seem to be any really realistic chemistry software available yet.
---
11. I remember there was a professional software that was good.
---
12. But even the organic fairy can't solve it.
---
13. So, the main focus should still be on the exam perspective.
---
14. Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section will be on electricity, such as operations involving electricity).
---
15. Okay
---
16. What about superconductors?
---
17. I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
---
18. If you can create a comprehensive and free software, it should be very popular.
---
19. If the CPU is not good, then it's game over.
---
20. If you include all these, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore 😂
---
21. It's a series of lab classes.
---
22. Hey, good idea
---
23. Hehe
---
24. ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
---
25. @3 Can light-sensitive components be added?
---
26. The question is
---
27. Where does the light come from?
---
28. What about light?
---
29. Are you shining a light bulb on a photosensitive resistor?
---
30. Touch by hand
---
31. I think there's no problem
---
32. Then it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)

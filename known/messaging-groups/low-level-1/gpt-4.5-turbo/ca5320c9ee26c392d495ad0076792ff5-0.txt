1. P4233: May I ask?
2. P8: Group sharing.
3. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
4. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
5. P4234: [Emoji]
6. P4232: [Emoji][Emoji]
7. P4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer: Hello :)
9. P4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer: [Image] Updates in progress
11. Designer: This one is more complicated, so it will take some more time... Hopefully it will be ready for release this week
12. Designer: There will be: multimeter; energized screw tube; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem solving and middle school teaching)
13. P4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer: Have you encountered any problems during your use?
15. Designer: We try to design it to be usable without additional instructions, or we will provide some tips when you first open it based on feedback
16. P4235: Mainly for schools to build information technology schools
17. P4235: Need a user manual for this software
18. Designer: Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?
19. P4232: This is great, hoping it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams. Also, it would be great to have a function to hide the background grid with one click, making it easier for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no convenient software for drawing circuit diagrams for circuit-related questions.
20. Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later
22. P4235: You can also include mechanics experiments
23. Designer: For example, after connecting the physical diagram, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics is figured out; it will take some time
25. P4232: Oh, that's good
26. Designer: I hope to figure out electromagnetics before the end of the year
27. P4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do exercises in the application
29. P4234: It's starting to take shape [Emoji]
30. Designer: For example, connecting the circuit diagram to see the physical diagram, or vice versa

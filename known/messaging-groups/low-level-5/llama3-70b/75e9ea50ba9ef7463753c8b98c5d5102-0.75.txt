You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (19 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
19. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: proposing simulated experiment assessment; outlining experimental details; highlighting usability concerns
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: expressing enthusiasm; validating designer's idea
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: promising inclusive decision making; consulting with the group; ensuring collective input
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: seeking feedback; consulting teachers; exploring textbook conventions
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: seeking confirmation; sharing visual examples; illustrating intersection types
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: validating common practice; sharing knowledge; highlighting persistence of old styles
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Thoughts: In this initial coding round, I aim to focus on the language and tone used by the designers and users in the conversation. I'll explore how they interact with each other, share ideas, and negotiate meanings. From the lens of learning sciences, I'll examine how the designers and users co-construct knowledge and understanding. Through the lens of human-computer interaction, I'll analyze how the designers present and refine their ideas, and how users respond to these ideas. Finally, from the lens of participatory design, I'll investigate how the designers involve users in the decision-making process and how users influence the design.

Interpretation phrases for each item:

1. proposing simulated experiment assessment; outlining experimental details; highlighting usability concerns
2. expressing enthusiasm; validating designer's idea
3. promising inclusive decision making; consulting with the group; ensuring collective input
4. seeking feedback; consulting teachers; exploring textbook conventions
5. seeking confirmation; sharing visual examples; illustrating intersection types
6. validating common practice; sharing knowledge; highlighting persistence of old styles
7. clarifying intersection type options
8. signaling work in progress
9. providing specific input
10. acknowledging user input
11. simplifying design elements
12. suggesting alternative design approach
13. considering multiple design options
14. explaining design limitations; offering workarounds
15. sharing visual examples
16. expressing gratitude; committing to improvement
17. inquiring about update schedule; expressing eagerness
18. providing update schedule; outlining release plan
19. emphasizing update significance

Summary: The conversation revolves around the design and development of Physics Lab's online community, specifically focusing on the creation of a function for simulated experiment assessment. The designers actively involve users in the decision-making process, seeking feedback and input on various aspects of the design. Users respond with enthusiasm and provide valuable insights, influencing the design direction.

Notes: A key theme emerging from this conversation is the collaborative nature of the design process. The designers prioritize user input and feedback, which suggests a participatory design approach. The conversation also highlights the importance of usability concerns and the need for simplicity in design elements. Additionally, the designers' language and tone convey a sense of inclusivity and gratitude, which may contribute to building a strong online community.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Summary of previous conversation: This conversation reveals the emergence and development of the Physics Lab online community, where designers and users are actively engaged in a collaborative process. The designers are responding to user feedback, incorporating new features, and planning for future updates. Key areas of focus include user needs, an iterative design process, collaborative and social aspects, alignment with educational contexts, and technical capabilities such as bidirectional conversion between physical and circuit diagrams. The community is actively shaping the development of the software, and the designers are committed to addressing user concerns and incorporating their suggestions.
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary phrases: reiterating the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary phrases: suggesting a focus on categorization and refinement rather than completeness
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary phrases: acknowledging the previous message
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

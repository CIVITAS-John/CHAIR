You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: enhance community satisfaction
Quotes:
- User: Updated

2.
Label: announcement of plans
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

3.

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- Designer: We are working on this part

14.
Label: foster a sense of ownership among users
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

15.
Label: linked to educational utility
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

16.

Quotes:
- Designer: Okay.

17.
Label: seek usage instructions
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

18.
Label: encourage thoughtful refinement
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

19.
Label: provided detailed information
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

20.
Label: announce future consultation
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

21.
Label: emphasize user experience
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

22.
Label: initiate greeting
Quotes:
- User: Hello everyone

23.
Label: describe use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

24.
Label: provide technical information
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

25.
Label: support design integrity
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

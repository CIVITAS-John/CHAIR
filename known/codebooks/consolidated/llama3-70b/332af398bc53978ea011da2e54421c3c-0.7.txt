You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

2.
Label: seek confirmation
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

3.
Label: invite suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

4.
Label: appreciated community help
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

5.
Label: personal connection
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

6.
Label: expand community interests
Quotes:
- User: Can you also include mechanics experiments?

7.
Label: user 4232 suggests export function
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

8.
Label: support effective use of the platform
Quotes:
- Designer: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch

9.
Label: user 4232 acknowledges designer's input
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

10.
Label: prepare users for substantial changes in the platform
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

11.
Label: provide input on design preferences
Quotes:
- User: Left side

12.
Label: highlight user centered design effectiveness
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

13.
Label: hypothesize compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

14.
Label: highlight its effectiveness in educational contexts
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

15.
Label: user 4234 suggests improvement
Quotes:
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

16.
Label: provide details
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

17.
Label: reinforce commitment to user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

18.
Label: share visual update
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

19.
Label: motivate community involvement
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

20.
Label: support diverse experimental applications
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

21.
Label: designer 1 invites suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

22.
Label: provide visual reference
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

23.
Label: emphasize importance of user guidance
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

24.
Label: suggest alternative system
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

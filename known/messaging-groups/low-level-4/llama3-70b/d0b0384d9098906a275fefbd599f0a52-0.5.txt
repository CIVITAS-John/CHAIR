You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: @ morning tea moonlight how can i upload a high definition; uncensored version of this crappy avatar?; seeking technical assistance; frustration with current avatar limitations
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about platform compatibility; potential interest in accessibility
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: offering assistance; showing interest in user's profession
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: yes; confirming profession; establishing credibility
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

Thoughts: 
In this initial coding phase, I will focus on understanding the context and intent behind each message. I will explore the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will examine how the designers and users interact, share information, and collaborate. I will also look for signs of community building, technical assistance, and feedback mechanisms.

Interpretations for each message:

1. Image sharing; introductory gesture
2. Seeking technical assistance; frustration with current avatar limitations; addressing a community member
3. Inquiring about platform compatibility; potential interest in accessibility
4. Offering assistance; showing interest in user's profession; establishing rapport
5. Confirming profession; establishing credibility
6. Providing information; community engagement; setting expectations
7. Encouraging feedback; participatory design
8. Requesting features; demonstrating expertise; shaping the development process
9. Prioritizing development; managing expectations; acknowledging feedback
10. Gathering opinions; participatory design; community engagement
11. Expressing gratitude; community building
12. Seeking information; technical inquiry; community support
13. Expressing appreciation; community engagement; finding resources

Summary:
The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community, with designers and users interacting, sharing information, and collaborating. The designers provide technical assistance, gather feedback, and set expectations for the development process. Users request features, demonstrate expertise, and express gratitude. The conversation is characterized by a sense of community building, participatory design, and technical inquiry.

Notes:
The conversation suggests that the Physics Lab online community is in its early stages, with designers and users establishing relationships and setting expectations. The designers seem to be open to feedback and willing to collaborate with users. The users are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the subject matter, and they are shaping the development process through their requests and suggestions.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
3. {Repeat the input 3}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 3}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 3}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 3}

1. minimal response
- Brief or minimal responses, often acknowledging or agreeing.
- A response that is brief or lacks substantial content.

2. responsive design
- Adaptation of the platform to different devices or screen sizes.
- The adaptability or responsiveness of a platform or tool to different devices or environments.

Definitions for each code:

1. minimal response
Relationship: The two concepts are parallel, describing the brevity and lack of substantial content in a response.
Criteria: A response that is brief and lacks substantial content, often acknowledging or agreeing.
Label: Brief Response

2. responsive design
Relationship: The two concepts are synonymous, describing the adaptability of a platform or tool to different devices or environments.
Criteria: The adaptability or responsiveness of a platform or tool to different devices or screen sizes.
Label: Responsive Design

3. inclusive design
Relationship: The two concepts are synonymous, describing design approaches that prioritize accessibility and inclusivity for diverse users.
Criteria: Design approaches that prioritize inclusivity and accessibility for diverse users.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P4232: Thank you.
2. P8: You're welcome. If you encounter any problems during use, feel free to discuss them directly in the group.
3. P4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to do everything and ends up being inconvenient to use.
4. Designer: I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to set up a virtual machine.
5. Designer: In theory, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from around 2008 onwards).
6. Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, with the following updates:
7. Designer: # New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a brief process, rather than immediately. 
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface. 
Support for undoing wire connections, component creation, and deletion. 
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current. 
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key. 

# New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter. 
Added a student power supply (AC/DC ideal power supply). 

# Adjustment of Component Properties
Dry cells now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources. 
Incandescent light bulbs now have voltage-current characteristics parameters and are no longer ideal resistors. 
The resistor law experiment now uses real formulas for calculation with adjustable parameters. 
Hidden terminals 3 and 4. 

# Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue caused by unit conversion when editing properties in the editor. 
Terminal arrows no longer display jumping animations. 
There may be calculation errors in certain circuit connections.
8. P4232: It is suggested to add an exit button function for the PC version, as many regions now use all-in-one touch screen computers without physical keyboards.
9. Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, and there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. P8: In that case, shouldn't a virtual keyboard be added to every input field?
11. Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input field, probably like that.
13. Designer: I tried it in junior high last time. Now there is a clever way to click on the link button in the upper right corner, pop up the browser, and it won't be full screen anymore... = =
14. P4232: @Designer Yes, that's right.
15. P4232: It would be convenient to have an export function, or save and import experiments. We can set the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer: It will be available.
17. Designer: Is there a network in the classroom?
18. P4232: Generally not, since one time during a city-level public class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

Summary: The conversation demonstrates the emergence of an active online community around the Physics Lab software. The community members provide feedback, feature requests, and suggestions to the software designer, who responds with updates and explanations. The discussion covers a range of topics, including software functionality, usability, and compatibility, as well as the practical considerations of using the software in a classroom setting. The community members exhibit a collaborative and supportive dynamic, working together to improve the software and address any issues that arise.

Notes: The conversation highlights the importance of user feedback and community engagement in the development of educational software. The designer's responsiveness and willingness to incorporate suggestions from the community members contribute to the overall positive dynamics within the group. The discussion also touches on the technical challenges and considerations involved in deploying the software in a classroom environment, such as compatibility with older hardware and the need for network access. The community's focus on improving the software's usability and practicality for educational purposes suggests a strong commitment to the shared goal of enhancing the learning experience.

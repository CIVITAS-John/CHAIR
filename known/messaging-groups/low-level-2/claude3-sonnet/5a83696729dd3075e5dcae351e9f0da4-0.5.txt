1. P8: [Image]
2. Designer: @早茶月光 How can I upload a high-resolution image without the watermark?
3. P4229: Is it for the PC version?
4. Designer: How about I upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.
6. Designer: 
7. Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download link are in the group announcement.
8. Designer: Feel free to share any suggestions and needs.
9. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
10. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
11. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
12. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
13. P4231: [Emoji] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
14. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.

Summary: The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community, where users interact, share information, and make requests or suggestions. A designer or developer is actively involved, responding to queries, sharing updates, and gathering feedback. Users express appreciation for the work being done and make specific requests for features or demonstrations. The community seems to be focused on developing educational resources, with a collaborative approach involving input from various members.

Notes:
- The community appears to be centered around the development of an educational physics application or platform called "Physics Lab."
- Users are interested in obtaining high-resolution images and downloading the application for different platforms (PC, interactive whiteboards).
- There is a sense of respect and appreciation for the experts or developers involved in the project.
- Users are encouraged to share suggestions and needs, indicating a collaborative and inclusive approach.
- The developer acknowledges requests and plans to prioritize certain areas (electricity, magnetism) before moving on to others (mechanics).
- Overall, the conversation highlights the emergence of an online community focused on creating educational resources, with active participation from both developers and users.

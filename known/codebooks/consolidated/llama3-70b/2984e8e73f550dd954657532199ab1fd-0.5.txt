You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: emphasizing ai's efficiency, valuing time-saving solutions
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as valuing time-saving solutions is a direct result of emphasizing AI's efficiency.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge AI's efficiency and value its time-saving capabilities.
Phrase: Value AI's efficiency.

2.
Concepts: identifying ai limitations, recognizing limitations of ai-assisted learning
Relationship: The concepts are complementary, as identifying AI limitations leads to recognizing the limitations of AI-assisted learning.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge AI's limitations and recognize their impact on learning.
Phrase: Identify AI limitations.

3.
Concepts: referring to error messages and line numbers, discussing error messages and feedback
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as referring to error messages and line numbers is a specific aspect of discussing error messages and feedback.
Criteria: Participants discuss and evaluate error messages and feedback in NetLogo.
Phrase: Discuss error messages.

4.
Concepts: exploring netlogo commands, exploring system functionality
Relationship: The concepts are complementary, as exploring NetLogo commands is a part of exploring system functionality.
Criteria: Participants explore and learn about NetLogo commands and system functionality.
Phrase: Explore system functionality.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. User-4232: Thank you.
Preliminary codes: user 4232 expresses gratitude
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary codes: designer 2 encourages open feedback; community support
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary codes: user 4232 provides positive feedback; software usability
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary codes: designer 1 considers xp compatibility; potential solution with virtual machine
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary codes: designer 1 provides theoretical compatibility information; system requirements
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary codes: designer 1 announces new version release; update notification
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

Thoughts: 
In this conversation, I plan to explore the emergence of the online community around Physics Lab. I'll analyze the interactions between designers and users, focusing on how they exchange feedback, provide support, and discuss the development of the software. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective, examining how the community facilitates knowledge sharing and collaboration. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll investigate how users interact with the software and provide feedback on usability. Finally, I'll examine the participatory design approach, looking at how designers engage with users and incorporate their feedback into the development process.

Codes for each message:

1. User-4232 expresses gratitude
2. Designer 2 encourages open feedback; community support

5. Designer 1 provides theoretical compatibility information; system requirements
6. Designer 1 announces new version release; update notification
7. Designer 1 lists new features, components, and bug fixes in version 1.01
8. User 4232 requests exit button function for PC version; highlights need for touch screen support
9. Designer 1 agrees to add exit button function in next update
10. Designer 2 suggests adding soft keyboard for numeric input
11. Designer 1 mentions on-screen keyboards for touch screens
12. Designer 1 notes limitations of on-screen keyboards
13. Designer 1 shares personal experience with on-screen keyboards
14. User 4232 agrees with Designer 1
15. User 4232 requests export or save/import functions for experiments
16. Designer 1 confirms export function will be added
17. Designer 1 inquires about internet access in classrooms
18. User 4232 explains internet access is generally not available in classrooms due to past incidents

Summary: 
The conversation revolves around the development and use of Physics Lab software. Designers engage with users, providing updates, and soliciting feedback. Users express gratitude, provide positive feedback, and request new features. Designers respond to user requests, offering solutions and considering user needs.

Notes: 
The conversation highlights the collaborative nature of the online community, with designers and users working together to improve the software. The designers' participatory approach is evident in their responses to user feedback and requests. The discussion also touches on the importance of considering the context in which the software will be used, including the limitations of classroom technology infrastructure.

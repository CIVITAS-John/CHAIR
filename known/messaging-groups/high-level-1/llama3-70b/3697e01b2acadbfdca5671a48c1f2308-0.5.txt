Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. P4230: Okay okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
3. P4231: I saw the files in the group, thank you.
4. Designer: [Image 14]
5. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.
7. Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. P4232: How to use the PC version?
9. P4232: [Image 19]
10. P8: It does not support the XP system.

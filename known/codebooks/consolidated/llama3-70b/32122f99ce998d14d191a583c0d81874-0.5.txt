You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between sub-codes. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. explaining intentions, explain intention of the app design.
- Explaining the intention or goal behind a question or design decision.
- Explaining the intention or purpose behind the app's design.

2. discussing limitations, explain current version's limitation.
- Discussing limitations of a solution or system constraints.
- Explaining limitations or constraints of the current version.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Relationship: Inclusion (explaining intentions is a broader concept that includes explaining the intention of the app design)
Criteria: Statements that clarify the purpose or goal behind a design decision or feature.
Label: Explaining Intentions
Category: Design Rationale

2.
Relationship: Parallel (discussing limitations and explaining current version's limitation are parallel concepts)
Criteria: Statements that acknowledge or describe the constraints or limitations of a system or solution.
Label: Discussing Limitations
Category: System Constraints

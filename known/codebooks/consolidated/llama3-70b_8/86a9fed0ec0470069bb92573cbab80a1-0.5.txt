You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

17.
Label: considering implications of touch interface
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
- Designer: Hmm hmm.

23.
Label: providing flexibility

24.
Label: demonstrating educational relevance
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

25.
Label: praise software design
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

26.
Label: provide positive reinforcement
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

27.

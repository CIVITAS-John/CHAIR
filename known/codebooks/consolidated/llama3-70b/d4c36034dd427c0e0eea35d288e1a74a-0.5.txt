You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate verb phrase as label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated verb phrase of code 1}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: describes updates, releases software updates
Relationship: Inclusion (describes updates is a part of releasing software updates)
Criteria: Designer provides information about software updates or releases, including descriptions, changelogs, or notes.
Label: Reports updates

2.
Concepts: shares development progress, provide development updates
Relationship: Parallel (sharing development progress and providing development updates are two related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Designers provide information about the development process, including progress, challenges, or new features.
Label: Shares development insights

3.
Concepts: implements feedback, iterative development based on user feedback
Relationship: Inclusion (iterative development is a part of implementing feedback)
Criteria: User feedback is acknowledged and incorporated into the design process, influencing design decisions.
Label: Incorporates user feedback

4.
Concepts: informal interaction, engage in informal communication
Relationship: Inclusion (engaging in informal communication is a part of informal interaction)
Criteria: Users or designers engage in casual conversations, using colloquial language or emojis, indicating a relaxed communication style.
Label: Engages informally

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: engage community curiosity
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

2.

- Designer: 7 is okay.

3.
Label: inquiring about the availability of internet in the class
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

4.
Label: explaining technical requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

5.
Label: seeks clarification on the preferred side for circuit diagram intersections
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- User: Left side

6.
Label: designer 1 values community input
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

Label: gives a semi-promise of its completion date
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

8.
Label: define project scope
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

9.
Label: designer 1 responds to user 4229

12.
Label: acknowledging that the on screen keyboard may not be accessible without touching the input field
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

17.
Label: confirming design direction
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay.

18.
Label: reaction to feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

19.
Label: invite feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

20.
Label: seeks continued support
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

21.
Label: explain functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

22.
Label: limitation of the team
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

23.
Label: use humor to maintain engagement
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

24.
Label: expresses approval and enthusiasm for the proposed idea of simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

25.
Label: emphasize need for offline capabilities
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

26.
Label: adapting to user suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

27.
Label: emphasizing categorization and prioritization
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

28.
Label: indicate collaborative approach
Quotes:

Quotes:
- User: How to download?

32.
Label: seeks specific features for demonstrations
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

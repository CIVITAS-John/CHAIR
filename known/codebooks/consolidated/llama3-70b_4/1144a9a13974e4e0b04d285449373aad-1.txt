You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

- Users prefer having options for clear explanations and fixes in AI-driven interfaces.

2.
Concepts: seeks human-ai collaboration, collaborates with ai as a pair programmer
- Envisions AI as a collaborative partner in the coding and learning process.
- Imagines AI as a collaborative programmer, providing real-time feedback.

3.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: clarifying parameters, preferring clear ai explanations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both concern the user's desire for transparency and control in AI-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Users value the ability to clarify parameters and receive clear AI explanations for their inputs.
Phrase: Seeking transparent AI interactions.

2.
Concepts: seeks human-ai collaboration, collaborates with ai as a pair programmer
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both envision AI as an active partner in the coding and learning process.
Criteria: Users seek collaboration with AI as a pair programmer, receiving real-time feedback and guidance.
Phrase: Collaborating with AI as a coding partner.

3.
Concepts: ai response, solicits user input
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve user-AI interaction, where the AI responds to user input or solicits feedback.
Criteria: Users respond to AI-driven interfaces' prompts or questions, providing input or feedback.
Phrase: Interacting with AI through feedback loops.

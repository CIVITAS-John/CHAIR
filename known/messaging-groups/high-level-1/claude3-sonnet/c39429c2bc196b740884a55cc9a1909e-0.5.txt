Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label: A label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...

1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

## Label: User Support
Definition: Designers providing support, responding to user questions/issues, and gathering user feedback.
- "No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group."
- "Okay. Please give more suggestions!"
- "Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:"

## Label: User Engagement  
Definition: Users actively using the software, providing feedback, and engaging with the designers.
- "This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use."
- "How do you use the PC version?"
- "[Image 2-19]"

## Label: Iterative Development
Definition: Designers continuously updating and improving the software based on user feedback and their own insights.
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate)."
- "The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component."
- "XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine."

## Label: Compatibility Considerations  
Definition: Designers considering compatibility with different operating systems and hardware configurations.
- "It does not support the XP system."
- "Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old."
- "Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards)."

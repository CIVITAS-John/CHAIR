Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the community's emergence.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...

1. Designer: Done.
2. P5: Good ðŸ˜‚
3. P8: @Designer  we need an admin here.
4. P13: Are all the members in this group top students?
5. P14: Except me.
6. P13: ï¼‹1
7. P15: Plus one more.
8. P16: ï¼‹1
9. P10: May I ask what does "+1" mean?
10. P11: It means "me too".

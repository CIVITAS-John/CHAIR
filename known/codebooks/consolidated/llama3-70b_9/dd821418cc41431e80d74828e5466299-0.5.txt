You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: expressing positive user experience
Quotes:
- E04: It seems like it's, you know, pretty straightforward to use and like intuitive, which is nice. And it's like, it's easy to interact with. So I feel like if I had like enough time to play around with it, it could be like really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Straightforward to use and intuitive.

2.
Label: behavioral change - get in the habit of asking questions
Quotes:
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

3.
Label: e04 experiences tension between novice and expert oriented design
Quotes:
- E04: Like in this type of, like, like I was saying with this window, for example, where it's giving you the options and basically there was that one time where the only option was for it to explain itself.  Which makes sense, but it'd be nice if I could just kind of like forego that and just keep doing, you know, But you know, for someone that's probably not as useful for someone who's like still learning, but like, I guess for someone who's more experienced, it's nice to be able to just like skip over things that you already know. (interviewer's observation) Options too limited; tension between a novice-oriented/expert-oriented design.

4.
Label: expresses interest in learning gis extensions within a limited time frame
Quotes:
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time. (interviewer's observation) AI could potentially save time for learning new extensions (compared with core concepts) of NetLogo.

5.
Label: showcasing expertise and willingness to assist
Quotes:
- E04: So maybe I didn't prove it today, but I feel like I'm pretty competent with NetLogo. (interviewer's observation) Prefers helping others learn NetLogo.

6.
Label: emphasizing importance of strategic questioning
Quotes:
- E01: I've observed when I tried to suggest ChatGPT to other people, they're, um, they are amazed at the output that I can get. And that's because I know how to ask six questions in a row to zero in on what I'm after. (interviewer's observation) To maximize the capability of ChatGPT, one needs to know how to iteratively ask questions.

7.
Label: faces challenges with the interface getting stuck in a loop and inability to fix errors
Quotes:
- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.

8.
Label: frustration with error messages marking correct syntax as wrong
Quotes:
- E04: maybe you saw something that I didn't, but from my perspective, it seemed as though the code was set up appropriately, but it was marking the syntax as wrong. So maybe I was missing something, but I didn't see anything missing. So that was kind of frustrating. (interviewer's observation) Shows error messages even when it seems to be correct (that's a bug identified)

9.
Label: demonstrating a clear, established process of building agent based models
Quotes:
- E04: I just like being able to kind of, like, iteratively build it. The thing that I always do when I create a model is I do, like, the initial command. I'll set up and go here. I'll go ahead and after I kind of set up the buttons, I'll put the functions behind them back here in the interface. (interviewer's observation) E04 creates the code skeleton before asking ChatGPT. He has a clear idea & established process of building ABMs.

10.
Label: but only python at this time)
Quotes:
- E01: And some of them we still haven't been doing like hive mind, like how we are going to have the machine learning back from the user feedback or just from the compiler, right? You generate some code, but it doesn't work. So we have to tell you that this time, you didn't work. (interviewer's observation) The current ChatGPT implementation cannot check the generated code with external information (compiler, etc.) (partially solved by the Interpreter plugin, but only Python at this time)

11.
Label: limited experience with llm driven interfaces
Quotes:
- E04: I don't know if I've ever tried 4. I guess it would be 3.5. (interviewer's observation) Only used ChatGPT 3.5 before

12.
Label: reading ai output and deciding to copy & paste
Quotes:
- E04: Oh and you can run it. That's cool. (interviewer's observation) E04 reads the AI output and decides to copy & paste it although he could also run it.

13.
Label: encountering ai limitations
Quotes:
- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.

14.
Label: expressing desire for code assistance features
Quotes:
- E01: And I got to admit like these days, NetLogo is the only language I use that does not have a smart editor. It doesn't autocomplete it or give me options of these are five variables that begin with those three letters. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's lack of smart code editors (we have one in TU that he would later see).

15.
Label: chooses problem solving
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 chooses to fix the problem rather than showing the explanation.

16.
Label: lack of consistency in output - not sure what to expect
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

17.
Label: considers excluding r extension
Quotes:
- E04: "How about without the R extension" (interviewer's observation) E04 evaluates the AI response and decides that he does not need to use the R extension.

18.
Label: interviewee suggesting that ai should show only one error at a time for novices
Quotes:
- E01: So I would find it more helpful if it asked the questions one at a time. Before you tell me nine more errors. Just because users are always overfilling their buffer. So smaller requests work better. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests (for novice) only showing one error at a time in the AI-driven system.

19.
Label: maintaining a light hearted approach
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 laughs when he sees ChatGPT making a classical error.

20.
Label: mentions ai's potential to make errors
Quotes:
- E01: So maybe the details are wrong and, you know, Michael Tamalo or somebody jumped on me because I posted some answer and it used some function that wasn't available. AI had hallucinated some function. (interviewer's observation) AI might hallucinates.

21.
Label: compares ai suggestions to early navigation apps' inaccuracies
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

22.
Label: honoring chat gpt's own intuition even though it might be different from the convention
Quotes:
- E01: That's okay. Go is a convention. It's not really a requirement of the language that you use the word go. You can say banana to banana and have a button on the interface. It's a banana button. (interviewer's observation) E01 honors ChatGPT's own intuition even though it might be different from the convention.

23.
Label: experiences gaps in ai assistance
Quotes:
- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

24.
Label: questions ai capabilities
Quotes:
- E04: So if I can talk to it in NetLogo, does that mean I could give it in the logo command and then it would like turn that into code on the backend or? (interviewer's observation) Initial confusion over what the system could do.

25.
Label: highlights ai's promptness
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

26.
Label: finds interface helpful
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

27.
Label: novice
Quotes:
- E04: Like in this type of, like, like I was saying with this window, for example, where it's giving you the options and basically there was that one time where the only option was for it to explain itself.  Which makes sense, but it'd be nice if I could just kind of like forego that and just keep doing, you know, But you know, for someone that's probably not as useful for someone who's like still learning, but like, I guess for someone who's more experienced, it's nice to be able to just like skip over things that you already know. (interviewer's observation) Options too limited; tension between a novice-oriented/expert-oriented design.
- E01: And I find what I have trouble with and certainly what beginners have trouble with is "scope".   You know, when you go from one point to another and all of a sudden you're, you're not no longer in ask turtles to do something you're in, ask links to do. But you know, so all of a sudden you've shifted, you've shifted your variable space and this happens implicitly and all of a sudden you're writing code and then it gives you an error that of the nature X Y Z doesn't operate in a turtle context. (interviewer's observation) AI needs to support learning of the "scope" concept in NetLogo.
- E04: To me, it seems like you need to have a certain degree of expertise to understand where the errors are and how to fix them. Because otherwise it's like you're going down this path where you're blindly following the ChatGPT and you have no idea what's going on. For less experienced people, I wouldn't like that because it could put you in a worse situation. (interviewer's observation) Requires expertise to understand errors and debug them. Risks to blindly follow ChatGPT, esp. for less experienced people.
- E01: I'm not sure that any beginner wouldn't necessarily know that unless they'd ever practiced. And so some of the users of NetLogo have never programmed anything. So, (they might lack) the whole concept of debugging or maybe starting with a design outline. They start typing and then they get frustrated because they don't know how to debug code. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how novices might get stuck during the human-AI collaboration process.
- E01: In terms of learning experiences, like ramping up to using an assistant wrapping up to using ChatGPT might have some sort of evaluates. How well can you write instructions for another person? Some people just don't know how to conceptualize a problem. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how "writing instructions" is a capability that is missing on many people, and that is key to work with AI.

28.
Label: seeks easier ai interaction
Quotes:
- E04: "Draw a smiley face" / "Drawing on the canvas" (interviewer's observation) E04 switches to a simpler task.

29.
Label: e04 prefers helping others learn net logo
Quotes:
- E04: So maybe I didn't prove it today, but I feel like I'm pretty competent with NetLogo. (interviewer's observation) Prefers helping others learn NetLogo.

30.
Label: trying chat gpt with the same prompt
Quotes:
- E01: "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square, but the square should go larger each time it goes around in NetLogo." (interviewer's observation) Interviewer proposes to try ChatGPT with the same prompt.

31.
Label: suggesting a potential area for education and training
Quotes:
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time. (interviewer's observation) AI could potentially save time for learning new extensions (compared with core concepts) of NetLogo.

32.
Label: seeking ai assistance for reporter creation
Quotes:
- E04: "Can train-perceptron be turned into a reporter" (interviewer's observation) E04 uses "can you fix with my own idea".

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: provide detailed planned feature; show commitment to user needs
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: validate idea; express endorsement
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: plan user consultations; reiterate participatory design
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: consult on circuit diagram standards; seek specific educational input
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: confirm and provide visual reference; clarify details
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: affirm standard usage; agree on common practices
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation reflects a collaborative approach to developing and refining features for Physics Lab. The designer outlines plans for a simulated experiment assessment function, which garners positive feedback from a user, validating the idea. The designer emphasizes the participatory aspect by consulting the group and teachers about preferred circuit diagram standards, facilitating a dialogue that includes clarifications and suggestions. Continued work on the circuit diagram and other details, alongside expressions of support and inquiries about updates, underscores a cooperative and iterative development process, culminating in announcements about significant upcoming updates to the application across multiple platforms.

Notes: It is evident that the designers are deeply committed to involving users in the development process, particularly teachers who use the platform in educational contexts. This approach not only ensures that the tool meets user needs but also fosters a sense of community ownership and engagement. The responsiveness of the designers to user suggestions and feedback is integral in shaping the functionality and usability of Physics Lab, promoting a user-centered design culture.

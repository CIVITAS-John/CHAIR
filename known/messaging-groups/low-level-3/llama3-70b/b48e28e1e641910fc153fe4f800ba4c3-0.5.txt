You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (5 in total):
1. {an interpretation of message 1}
...
5. {an interpretation of message 5}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on understanding the context and intent behind each message. I'll consider the tone, language, and content of each message to identify patterns and themes. I'll also keep in mind the research question, "How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?" and look for clues about the community's early days. I'll draw on theories from learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to inform my coding.

Codes for each message:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0] -> **Initial Engagement**: The designer shares an image, likely an avatar or a logo, which could be a community-building attempt or a test of the platform's functionality.

2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar? -> **Technical Inquiry**: Designer-1 seeks help with uploading a high-definition avatar, possibly indicating a desire for customization or self-expression within the community.

3. User-4229: PC version? -> **Platform Inquiry**: User-4229 asks about a PC version, which might imply interest in accessing the community or resources through a desktop application.

4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher? -> **Technical Assistance** and **Role Identification**: Designer-1 offers to upload the avatar and inquires about User-4229's role, possibly to understand their needs or to establish a connection.

5. User-4229: Yes. -> **Role Confirmation**: User-4229 confirms their role as a teacher, which could influence their expectations and interactions within the community.

Summary: This conversation appears to be an early exchange between designers and a user, focusing on technical aspects, such as uploading avatars and accessing the community through different platforms. The designers seem to be engaged in community-building and technical troubleshooting, while the user is inquiring about the community's features and functionality.

Notes: It's interesting to see the designers taking an active role in engaging with users and addressing technical issues. The mention of a "crappy avatar" might indicate a lighthearted or humorous tone within the community. The role of teachers within the community is also an important aspect to explore further.

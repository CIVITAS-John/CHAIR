Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. P2: [Image 30]
2. P2: Just press the button with the wire
3. P7: Oh
4. P9: [Image 33]
5. P9: How to make it work
6. Designer: ï¼Ÿ
7. P9: [Checkin 37]
8. P9: [Checkin 38]
9. P10: Hello everyone, I am a new member. Nice to meet you all. Thank you.
10. P11: Seeking advice on a question.
11. P11: [Image 41]
12. P11: This is a rectifier circuit.
13. P11: The verification should be correct.
14. P11: However,
15. P11: [Image 45]
16. P11: The image is not as expected.
17. P11: Not sure if it's a circuit problem or a software bug, seeking advice.
18. P11: [Image 48]
19. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
20. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
21. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits, so I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know, so please enlighten me in the future. Thank you.
22. P4: Has it been updated?
23. P11: It's not ideal...
24. P11: I will consider the impedance.

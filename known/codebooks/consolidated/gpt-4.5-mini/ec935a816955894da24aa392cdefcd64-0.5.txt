You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (1 in total):
1. 
Concepts: learn to ask right questions repeatedly, value iterative questioning for improvement
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as both emphasize the importance of continuous questioning to enhance the effectiveness of AI interactions; one focuses on the learning process while the other highlights the value of this process for improvement.
Criteria: Users engage in a process of learning to formulate better questions through repeated practice, which they believe enhances their interactions with AI.
Phrase: Optimize AI interactions through iterative questioning

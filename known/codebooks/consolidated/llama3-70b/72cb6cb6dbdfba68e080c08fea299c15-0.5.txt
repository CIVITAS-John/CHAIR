You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Label: invite feedback
Quotes:
- Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?
- Have you encountered any problems during your use?
- Feel free to share any suggestions and needs.

Label: developer response
Quotes:
- Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, and there will probably be another round this weekend.
- I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to set up a virtual machine.
- Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.

3.
Label: progress update
Quotes:
- There will be updates. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version over the weekend.
- I found the files in the group, thank you.
- The update is quite substantial...

4.
Label: feature request
Quotes:
- First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
- This is great, hoping it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams. Also, it would be great to have a function to hide the background grid with one click, making it easier for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no convenient software for drawing circuit diagrams for circuit-related questions.
- It would be convenient to have an export function, or save and import experiments. We can set the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

- We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

11.
Label: future design plan
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
- Don't worry, it will be there, in the final optimization round of the circuit diagram.

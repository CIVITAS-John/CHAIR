You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: setting the tone
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

2.
Label: probes if user 4229 is a teacher
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

3.
Label: the conversation indicates an iterative development process influenced by user feedback and educational needs
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

4.
Label: providing reassurance of intuitive interface
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

5.
Label: interesting thought: use of special characters "~"
Quotes:
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

6.
Label: consider technical requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

7.
Label: community need
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

8.
Label: demonstrating educational relevance
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

9.
Label: setting new standards
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

10.
Label: give reasons for why the future perfection is not necessarily needed
Quotes:
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

11.
Label: suggests adding an export function or the ability to save/import experiments for enhanced convenience in educational settings
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

12.
Label: providing technical specifications
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

13.
Label: defining the scope of physics lab
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

14.
Label: recognizing attention to detail
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

15.
Label: showing interest in user context
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

16.
Label: providing insight into educational norms
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

17.
Label: exploring functionality
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

18.
Label: commits to uploading new avatar version
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

19.
Label: managing limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

20.
Label: if there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. we could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

21.
Label: plan for iterative feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

22.
Label: personal anecdote
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

23.
Label: providing development timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

24.
Label: seeking information
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: problem complexity
Quotes:
- E01: The problem I posted was about 100 pages of NetLogo and then 100 pages, 100 lines of NetLogo. And it was a real problem that I had looked at. I would love to help this person, but this is going to take me minimum of two hours to figure out what are they trying to do? (interviewer's observation) Although AI made mistake, E01 still believes in the value in having an AI-generated solution (compared with no solution or no help).

2.
Label: advocates for peer programming
Quotes:
- E01: I'm an advocate of peer programming. It's about 10 times more efficient than single programming...

5.
Label: notes discrepancies in ai understanding
Quotes:
- E04: I know that Perceptron model exists in the NetLogo model library.

(interviewer's observation) E04 expects ChatLogo to find "Perceptron" model from the library but it does not. He evaluates the search results of the AI.

6.
Label: code-quality
Quotes:
- E01: You know, so in point of fact, I considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can.

Plain / not-tricky code's advantage in maintenance.

7.
Label: argues for ai efficiency
Quotes:
- E01: But if a tool can do your, can do most of your work in five minutes, why would you spend two weeks? ... I would never hire someone who spent two weeks solving a problem that they could do in five minutes. (interviewer's observation) AI might be able to save people's time.

8.
Label: evaluates ai search results
Quotes:
- E04: I know that Perceptron model exists in the NetLogo model library.

Quotes:
- E01: And, and they don't, this is an unfamiliar task to them apparently. So they want to ask one question and get the right answer the first time. And I, I don't have that expectation. I'll ask the right question and it'll get me 80% of the way there. (interviewer's observation) Novices might have a too high expectation for ChatGPT (but it cannot achieve that).

11.
Label: highlights cognitive load
Quotes:
- E01: So I would find it more helpful if it asked the questions one at a time. Before you tell me nine more errors. Just because users are always overfilling their buffer. So smaller requests work better. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests (for novice) only showing one error at a time in the AI-driven system.

12.

And I say, Can you fix that?

25.
Label: usability
Quotes:
- E01: I don't want chat GPT to write 27 operations in one line and show how brilliant it is.

29.
Label: ability
Quotes:
- E01: I think the key is to not replace human judgment and ability, but to find a fast way to increase human capability and judgment. (interviewer's observation) Augmentation of human capabilities & building on human judgement. Subjectivity of humanity?

30.
Label: critiques improper help requests
Quotes:
- E01: if you approach the user group politely, graciously, and instead of dropping your entire code on it, you go, I narrowed it down to this. I read this documentation.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation covers a range of topics including educational backgrounds, technical components, laboratory materials, community engagement, exam perspectives, challenges in simulating experiments, and the need for realistic educational software.
1. P2: What about superconductors?
Preliminary tags: technical components; superconductors
2. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
Preliminary tags: simulation challenges; computational power
3. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
Preliminary tags: educational technology; software development
4. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
5. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
6. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
7. P11: Hey, good idea.
8. P2: Hehe.
9. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
10. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
11. Designer: The question is,
12. Designer: Where does the light come from?
13. P11: What about light?
14. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
15. P2: Touch it with your hand.
16. P14: I think there's no problem.
17. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
18. P2: And a small light.
19. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
20. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
21. P2: ï¼Ÿ
22. P14: [Image 245]
23. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
24. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
25. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
26. P1: Let's put up some ads.
27. Designer: Hmm.
28. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
29. Designer: Oh.
30. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).
31. P11: 23333
32. P11: I was just about to say.
33. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
34. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
35. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?

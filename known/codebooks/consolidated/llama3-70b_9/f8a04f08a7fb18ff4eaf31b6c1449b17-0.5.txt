You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: learning curve with ai, human-effort (negative): learning curve
Relationship: The concepts are related as the learning curve with AI is perceived as requiring human effort, which is viewed negatively.
Criteria: Users experience and express frustration with the learning curve when working with AI.
Phrase: Experience frustration with AI learning curve.

2.
Concepts: proposing ai assistance, advocating for ai-assisted problem-solving
Relationship: The concepts are related as proposing AI assistance is a way of advocating for AI-assisted problem-solving.
Criteria: Participants propose and advocate for AI assistance to optimize code and problem-solving for efficiency.
Phrase: Advocate for AI-assisted problem-solving.

3.
Concepts: seek help from ai, ai supporting users in seeking assistance
Relationship: The concepts are related as seeking help from AI is enabled by AI supporting users in seeking assistance.
Criteria: Participants seek help and clarification from LLM-driven interfaces or online resources, which support users in seeking assistance.
Phrase: Seek help from AI.

4.
Concepts: discusses ai capacity
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants discuss and identify the capacity and limitations of the AI system, including its performance and feedback limitations.

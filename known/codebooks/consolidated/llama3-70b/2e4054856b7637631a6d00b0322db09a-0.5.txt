You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: request ai code, request ai verification, evaluate ai code
Relationship: These concepts are related as they all involve participants seeking assistance or feedback from AI in the code development process.
Criteria: Participants request and evaluate AI-generated code and verification for error-free code.
Phrase: Seek AI assistance in code development.

2.
Concepts: proposes ai-powered linting, compares ai to a linting tool
Relationship: These concepts are related as they both involve the idea of using AI for code review and comparison to traditional linting tools.
Criteria: Participants propose and compare AI-powered linting to traditional linting tools for identifying conceptual mistakes.
Phrase: Envision AI-powered code review.

3.
Concepts: generate successful code, recognizes ai's code generation effectiveness
Relationship: These concepts are related as they both involve the successful generation of code by AI and the recognition of its effectiveness.
Criteria: Participants report successful AI code generation experiences and recognize AI's ability to generate accurate code.
Phrase: Experience AI-driven code success.

4.
Concepts: evaluating ai responses
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants evaluate AI responses to reflect on AI's understanding and inform decision-making.
Phrase: Assess AI response quality.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: introducing a new feature for simulated experiment assessment
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: expressing enthusiasm for the idea
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: promising community involvement in the development process
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: seeking feedback from teachers on circuit diagram notation
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: providing an example of a circuit diagram notation
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirming the common notation style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

4. Seeking feedback from teachers on circuit diagram notation;
5. Providing an example of a circuit diagram notation;
6. Confirming the common notation style;
7. Seeking clarification on notation style;
8. Providing development status update;
9. Providing feedback on notation style;
10. Acknowledging feedback;
11. Requesting simplification;
12. Providing alternative notation style;
13. Considering multiple notation styles;
14. Providing testing version of circuit diagram;
15. Sharing image of circuit diagram;
16. Expressing gratitude for support;
17. Inquiring about update schedule;
18. Providing update schedule;
19. Describing the scope of the update.

Summary: This conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab's online community, particularly the introduction of a new feature for simulated experiment assessment. The designers engage with users, seeking feedback on circuit diagram notation and involving them in the development process. Users respond with enthusiasm and provide valuable input, which the designers acknowledge and incorporate.

Notes: The designers seem to prioritize community involvement and user feedback, which may contribute to the emergence of the online community. The conversation is characterized by a sense of collaboration and mutual respect. I'll continue to explore how this dynamic evolves throughout the conversation.

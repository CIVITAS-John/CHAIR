Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation revolves around a software or application for physics experiments and simulations, particularly focused on circuit diagrams and the ability to convert between physical and circuit diagrams. The designer shares updates, planned features, and timelines, while community members provide feedback, suggestions, and reactions. There is a discussion about including a user manual, mechanics experiments, and interface improvements. The overall tone is positive and collaborative, with the designer actively engaging with the community and soliciting feedback.
1. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
2. Designer: Hmm.
3. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
4. P4232: Indeed
5. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
6. Designer: I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
7. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
8. P4232: This is a really good idea
9. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
10. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

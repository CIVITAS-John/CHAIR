Thoughts: 
In this conversation, I plan to analyze the emergence of the Physics Lab online community through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will examine how participants interact with each other, share knowledge, and collaborate. I will also explore how the designer's role influences the community's development. Guiding questions include: How do participants use online resources to facilitate learning? How do they provide guidance and support to one another? How does the community foster a sense of cohesion and social politeness?

1. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
2. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.
3. Designer: Okay. Please give me more suggestions!
4. P4232: How to use the PC version?
5. P4232: [Image]
6. P8: It does not support the XP system.
7. P4232: Oh, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. P4232: Can it run on Win7?
9. P8: Win7 should work.
10. P4232: Thank you.
11. P8: You're welcome. If you encounter any problems during use, feel free to discuss them directly in the group.
12. P4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to do everything and ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer: I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to set up a virtual machine.
14. Designer: In theory, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from around 2008 onwards).

Summary: The conversation revolves around a physics lab software or simulation tool, with discussions about system requirements, compatibility with different Windows versions, and feedback on the usability of the software. Community members ask questions, provide information, share opinions, and engage with the designer, who acknowledges feedback and plans future improvements.

Notes: The conversation highlights the emergence of an online community around the physics lab software, with members seeking information, providing feedback, and engaging with the designer. The designer actively responds to questions, acknowledges feedback, and plans future improvements based on community input. This interaction between the community members and the designer fosters a collaborative environment for improving the software and addressing user needs.

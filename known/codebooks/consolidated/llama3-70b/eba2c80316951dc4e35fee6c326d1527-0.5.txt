1.
Label: summarizing the code and thinking about how the ai was understanding the request
Quotes:
- E01: So set up, move the turtle to go. Increase the size of the turtle by two units. Oh, dear. It's, it's making the turtle bigger. Oh, that's kind of, that's kind of messed it up a little bit then. (interviewer's observation) E01 reads the code and comments, summarizing the code, and thinks about how the AI was understanding the request.

2.
Label: ai creativity
Quotes:
- E01: That's okay. Go is a convention. It's not really a requirement of the language that you use the word go. You can say banana to banana and have a button on the interface. It's a banana button. (interviewer's observation) E01 honors ChatGPT's own intuition even though it might be different from the convention.

3.
Label: reasoning through ai responses
Quotes:
- E04: Interesting because it's trying to plot the name, which I know is wrong, but I'm just trying to remember how to... (interviewer's observation) E04 reasons through the responses of ChatGPT.

4.
Label: finding them non deterministic
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that. It is random in that regard, it's not deterministic in terms of what result you're going to get. (interviewer's observation) E04 regularly evaluates the AI responses and thinks that it is not deterministic.

5.
Label: requesting to plot the output of the model
Quotes:
- E04: "how can I plot the output of this model?" (interviewer's observation) E04 was prompted to follow-up with ChatGPT.

6.
Label: recognizing the need for improvement
Quotes:
- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.

7.
Label: struggling with debugging concepts
Quotes:
- E01: I'm not sure that any beginner wouldn't necessarily know that unless they'd ever practiced. And so some of the users of NetLogo have never programmed anything. So, (they might lack) the whole concept of debugging or maybe starting with a design outline. They start typing and then they get frustrated because they don't know how to debug code. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how novices might get stuck during the human-AI collaboration process.
- E04: So maybe I didn't prove it today, but I feel like I'm pretty competent with NetLogo. (interviewer's observation) Prefers helping others learn NetLogo.

8.
Label: recognizing the importance of syntax guidance
Quotes:
- E04: I think that it's nice that it's, it clarifies error codes. I think that's probably where people who are new get stuck the most is trying to figure out the syntax and all the different errors. (interviewer's observation) The capability to clarify the errors.

9.
Label: individualistic working culture
Quotes:
- E01: But you know, again, you have this culture, especially in the US of do your own work. People get a little too obsessive about doing their own work.  (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on U.S. individualistic working culture.

10.
Label: using ai generated code completely when realizing time constraints
Quotes:
- E04: It'd be that I just take this and see what this does. This should just be a single node so it'll kind of overwrite what I already did. (interviewer's observation) E04 uses the AI-generated code completely when realizing time constraints.

11.
Label: recognizing the need for fine tuning the design for experts
Quotes:
- E04: Part of the issue that I'm having now is just kind of like the learning curve, just trying to figure out how everything works. (interviewer's observation) E04 mentions a learning curve, likely because our current design is not fine-tuned for experts.

12.
Label: using stack exchange and net logo listserv
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

13.
Label: chat gpt's suggestions
Quotes:
- E01: So if I'm writing long NetLogo code now, I'd probably have ChatGPT just open on the side. And I write a block of code and then I handed ChatGPT. Say, could I have done this better? And it would go, yeah, you could rearrange this like that. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could help E01 optimize his code.

14.
Label: searching for specific syntax structures
Quotes:
- E04: "how to define breeds in netlogo" (interviewer's observation) E04 tries to find certain syntax structures from the AI-generated code and ask for it when it is not there.

And then six months later, you come back. Okay, now, where was I? (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on how professionals learn - they learn in fragments, in fragmented time blocks and need support from the system to remind them where they were.

17.
Label: limited experience with chat gpt
Quotes:
- E04: I don't know if I've ever tried 4. I guess it would be 3.5. (interviewer's observation) Only used ChatGPT 3.5 before

18.
Label: manual code writing
Quotes:
- E04: (Throughout this phase. He uses generated code only for reference when writing his own.) (interviewer's observation) E04 writes code manually with the steps given by ChatGPT, rather than copy & paste code.

19.
Label: and the line number
Quotes:
- E01: I have I found with with playing with with ChatGPT. And I was something at Python, I think I tried to give it the code. And I tried to run it generated error. And then I would go back to the next prompt and ChatGPT. And I go, that code is good. But it generates the following error. And I list the error online on this line, and I'd quote the line. And I say, Can you fix that?  (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug in the generated code, he refers to his previous practice with asking ChatGPT to debug with the code, the error message, and the line number. Interviewer did what E01 said.

20.
Label: recognizing the importance of iterative learning
Quotes:
- E04: It includes debugging, it is actually trying to incorporate like a unit test, which is really cool and really helpful, especially for beginners, because they can kind of, you know, check their inputs. Beginners, everyone really. They can debug their code appropriately. (interviewer's observation) Debugging capability.

21.
Label: challenges for novices
Quotes:
- E01: I couldn't (help the novice) because when a beginner just posts a big block of code, it says there's something wrong with this. (interviewer's observation) Challenges for novices to seek help: they simply post chunks of code without background information.

22.
Label: conceptual error detection
Quotes:
- E01: So I see this from beginners all the time is they, they just get totally lost. I call it lint program from Unix, you know, it's like it's a little green checkbox looks at you and go, okay, wait, it's just, you've spelled everything correctly, but you have a conceptual error here. If it, if it caught structural problems like that, that would, that would help. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo needs to have linting features that exist in other languages (we are working on that right now). Here, E01 wants the linting to support identifying conceptual mistakes, different from syntax mistakes which most linters work on.

23.
Label: ai effectiveness
Quotes:
- E01: If you know how to ask iterative questions, I think it could do pretty well. (interviewer's observation) E01 thinks ChatGPT would do well if one knows how to ask iterative questions.

24.
Label: critiquing net logo's unhelpful error messages
Quotes:
- E01: I think a lot of people, because they're very subtle, and then the error message is no help whatsoever to the user. You're, you're adding two variables over here and it's complaining about something over there. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's error messages could be unhelpful.

25.
Label: net logo's lack of smart editors
Quotes:
- E01: And I got to admit like these days, NetLogo is the only language I use that does not have a smart editor. It doesn't autocomplete it or give me options of these are five variables that begin with those three letters. (interviewer's observation) NetLogo's lack of smart code editors (we have one in TU that he would later see).

26.
Label: interface benefits
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

27.
Label: writing code in older versions of net logo
Quotes:
- E04: I guess, in their databases, they still have like, NetLogo 5 in there and stuff. So like, for example, you know, the anonymous functions, they still use like, the old, sometimes I'll get like, the old functionality for the anonymous functions. (interviewer's observation) Writing code in older versions of NetLogo

28.
Label: exploring chatgpt's limitations

29.
Label: expectations from ai
Quotes:
- E04: I know that Perceptron model exists in the NetLogo model library. So it's interesting to me that it didn't pull that up, but it could be that I used like the wrong verbiage, but it doesn't understand what I'm trying to do. (interviewer's observation) E04 expects ChatLogo to find "Perceptron" model from the library but it does not. He evaluates the search results of the AI.

30.
Label: asking chat logo to create a checkerboard pattern
Quotes:
- E01: "please write a netlogo program that produces a checker board with black and white squares?" (interviewer's observation) E01 asks ChatLogo to create a checkerboard pattern.

31.
Label: time constraints
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the, one of the things which I have observed, as I'm bouncing from like, because I do a lot of different languages and potentially, so I don't have that much time to spend in anyone. (interviewer's observation) As an expert, E01 knows many languages but does not have much time for each one.
- E04: It'd be that I just take this and see what this does. This should just be a single node so it'll kind of overwrite what I already did. (interviewer's observation) E04 uses the AI-generated code completely when realizing time constraints.

32.
Label: feedback loop
Quotes:
- E01: And some of them we still haven't been doing like hive mind, like how we are going to have the machine learning back from the user feedback or just from the compiler, right? You generate some code, but it doesn't work. So we have to tell you that this time, you didn't work. (interviewer's observation) The current ChatGPT implementation cannot check the generated code with external information (compiler, etc.) (partially solved by the Interpreter plugin, but only Python at this time)

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: lack of consistency in output, experiences variability in ai outputs
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both describe the uncertainty or unreliability of AI outputs.
Criteria: Participants experience uncertainty or inconsistency in AI's output or responses, leading to variability in AI outputs.
Phrase: Expresses uncertainty about AI outputs.

2.
Concepts: appreciates context understanding, praises ai's contextual understanding
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both describe the participant's positive view of AI's contextual understanding.
Criteria: Participants appreciate and praise AI's ability to understand context and infer user needs.
Phrase: Praises AI's contextual understanding.

3.
Concepts: ai effectiveness, emphasizes iterative questioning
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both describe the participant's view of how to effectively use AI.
Criteria: Participants discuss the effectiveness of AI and emphasize the importance of iterative questioning with AI.
Phrase: Emphasizes iterative questioning with AI.

4.
Concepts: uses ai for debugging, suggests ai debugging
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both describe the use of AI for debugging purposes.
Criteria: Participants use AI to assist with debugging and suggest using AI for debugging, providing specific error messages and line numbers.
Phrase: Uses AI for debugging.

5.
Concepts: analyzes and fixes errors, evaluates and debugs ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they all describe the participant's process of reviewing and refining AI-generated code.
Criteria: Participants analyze and manually fix errors in AI-generated code, evaluate and debug AI-generated code, and read and review AI-generated code in detail.
Phrase: Manually refines AI-generated code.

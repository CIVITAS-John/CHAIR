You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (19 in total):
1. {interpretation of message 1}; {another}; ...
...
19. {interpretation of message 19}; {another}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary codes: introducing new feature; enhancing simulation; experimental details
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary codes: expressing enthusiasm; appreciating innovation
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary codes: involving users; collaborative development; community engagement
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary codes: seeking input; consulting experts; textbook analysis
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary codes: sharing visual aids; facilitating discussion; circuit diagrams
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary codes: confirming understanding; shared knowledge; common practices
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Thoughts: For this first round of coding, I will focus on describing each message with low-level codes, exploring the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will examine how the designers and users interact, share ideas, and collaborate on the development of Physics Lab's online community.

Codes for each message:

1. Introducing new feature; enhancing simulation; experimental details
2. Expressing enthusiasm; appreciating innovation
3. Involving users; collaborative development; community engagement
4. Seeking input; consulting experts; textbook analysis
5. Sharing visual aids; facilitating discussion; circuit diagrams
6. Confirming understanding; shared knowledge; common practices
7. Seeking clarification; circuit diagram specifics
8. Development status update
9. Providing input; circuit diagram preference
10. Acknowledging user input
11. Simplification request; design iteration
12. Providing alternative; design suggestion
13. Considering multiple options; design flexibility
14. Providing context; testing and debugging
15. Sharing visual aids; facilitating discussion; circuit diagrams
16. Expressing gratitude; community appreciation
17. Inquiring about updates; release schedule
18. Providing updates; release schedule; platform support
19. Highlighting update significance; scope of changes

Summary: The conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab's online community, with designers and users collaborating on the design and features of the platform. The designers introduce new features, seek input from users, and share visual aids to facilitate discussion. Users provide feedback, suggestions, and enthusiasm for the project. The conversation highlights the participatory design approach, where designers and users work together to shape the online community.

Notes: The conversation suggests a strong emphasis on community engagement, collaborative development, and user-centered design. The designers' willingness to involve users and incorporate their feedback may contribute to the emergence of the online community. The use of visual aids, such as images, facilitates discussion and understanding among participants. The conversation also touches on the importance of simplicity, flexibility, and user input in the design process.

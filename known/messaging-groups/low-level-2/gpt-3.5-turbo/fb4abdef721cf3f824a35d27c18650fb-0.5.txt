You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. Designer: I tried it in junior high last time. Now there is a clever way to click on the link button in the upper right corner, pop up the browser, and it won't be full screen anymore... = =
2. P4232: @Designer Yes, that's right.
3. P4232: It would be convenient to have an export function, or save and import experiments. We can set the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
4. Designer: It will be available.
5. Designer: Is there a network in the classroom?
6. P4232: Generally not, since one time during a city-level public class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
7. Designer: 2333333333
8. Designer: Looks like we need to support local export now.
9. P4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid software downloads that may slow down the computers.
10. Designer: Mm-hmm.
11. P4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were all amazed.
12. Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. P4232: I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available on the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
15. Designer: Sorry for the midnight crowing :)
16. P4233: How to download?
17. P4233: May I ask?
18. P8: Group sharing.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* educational resources
* technical aspects
* expertise
* software development
* design considerations
* feedback and interaction
* user engagement
* community dynamics
* learning outcomes
* emotional response
* communication challenges
* organizational aspects
* user-generated content
* ethical design
* experimental procedures
* design optimization
* co-design processes
* human-computer interaction
* research outcomes

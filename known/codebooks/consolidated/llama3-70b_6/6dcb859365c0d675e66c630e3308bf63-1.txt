You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: elaborate on a point, encourage elaboration
Relationship: These concepts are logically related as one (elaborating on a point) is facilitated by the other (encouraging elaboration).
Criteria: Designers facilitate users to provide more information or clarify their thoughts.
Phrase: Encouraging elaboration.

2.
Concepts: respond to feedback, reaction to feedback
Relationship: These concepts are logically related as responding to feedback is a form of reaction to it.
Criteria: Designers acknowledge or address user concerns with a plan to implement changes.
Phrase: Responding to feedback.

3.
Concepts: classroom environment, explain internet restrictions
Relationship: These concepts are logically related as explaining internet restrictions is a characteristic of describing the classroom environment.
Criteria: Users describe their educational setting, including limitations on technology use.
Phrase: Describing classroom environments.

4.
Concepts: practical application, discuss classroom application
Relationship: These concepts are logically related as discussing classroom application is a form of exploring practical application.
Criteria: Users explore the implementation of Physics Lab in educational settings.
Phrase: Discussing practical applications.

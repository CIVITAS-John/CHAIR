You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (7 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Relationship: Inclusion (design adaptation is a way to achieve design flexibility)
Criteria: Designer or user discusses or implements customization options or adapts a design to meet user needs or hardware configurations.
Label: Design Adaptability

2.
Concepts: collaborative learning, mutual learning and design
Relationship: Intersection (collaborative learning and mutual learning occur simultaneously during the design process)
Criteria: Designer or user promotes collaborative learning, shares knowledge, or learns from each other during the design process.
Label: Collaborative Design Learning

3.
Concepts: release announcements, software announcements and releases
Relationship: Inclusion (software announcements and releases are a type of release announcement)
Criteria: Designers announce updates or releases of Physics Lab, or discuss sharing software information or releasing new software versions.
Label: Software Release Communication

4.
Concepts: design constraints, technical constraints
Relationship: Parallel (design constraints and technical constraints coexist and are related)
Criteria: Designers or users discuss or work within limitations, such as usability or technical constraints, related to the platform, system, or tool.
Label: Design Limitations

5.
Concepts: uncertainty, design uncertainty
Relationship: Inclusion (design uncertainty is a type of uncertainty)
Criteria: Expressing uncertainty, hesitation, or doubt about a topic, idea, or design.
Label: Design Uncertainty

6.
Concepts: development transparency, transparent developer discussion

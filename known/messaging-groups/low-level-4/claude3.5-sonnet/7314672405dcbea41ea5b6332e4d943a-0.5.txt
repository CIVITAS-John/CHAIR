You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: sharing personal experience; providing workaround solution; demonstrating familiarity with educational context
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: confirming agreement; engaging in dialogue
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: requesting additional feature; explaining use case scenario; providing insight into teaching practices
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: confirming future implementation; acknowledging user request
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about user environment; seeking contextual information for development
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: sharing institutional context; explaining technical limitations; providing insight into educational challenges
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Summary: This conversation builds upon previous discussions, focusing on the implementation and development of Physics Lab in educational settings. A teacher (User-4232) shares their experience using the software in class, highlighting positive student reactions and requesting an export function for offline use. The designer inquires about classroom internet availability, leading to a discussion about school technology policies and the need for offline functionality. The teacher's extensive experience in both middle and high school provides valuable context for the software's application. The designer announces an upcoming update and addresses inquiries about software access.

Notes: 
1. School technology policies significantly impact software design and implementation, necessitating offline functionality.
2. Teachers are actively engaging in the development process, providing valuable feedback and use case scenarios.
3. The software appears to be well-received by students, suggesting its effectiveness in engaging learners.
4. The designers show responsiveness to user feedback and willingness to adapt the software to meet educational needs.
5. There seems to be growing interest in the software among teachers, as evidenced by new users asking about access.
6. The development process appears to be iterative, with regular updates based on user input and app store requirements.

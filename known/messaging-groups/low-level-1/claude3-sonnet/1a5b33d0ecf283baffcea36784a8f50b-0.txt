Summary of the conversation until now: This conversation involves members of the Physics Lab online community discussing updates, features, and plans for a software application related to physics experiments and circuit diagrams. The designer shares information about upcoming updates, including new features like a multimeter, powered screwdriver, and support for circuit diagram conversions. Members provide feedback, request additional features like user manuals and mechanics experiments, and express excitement about the progress. The designer seeks user feedback, clarifies requests, and shares future plans for bidirectional conversion between physical and circuit diagrams, as well as plans to tackle electromagnetics and mechanics in the future.
1. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
2. Designer: Hmm.
3. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
4. P4232: Indeed
5. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
6. Designer: I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
7. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
8. P4232: This is a really good idea
9. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
10. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

11. Designer: [Image]This one.
12. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.

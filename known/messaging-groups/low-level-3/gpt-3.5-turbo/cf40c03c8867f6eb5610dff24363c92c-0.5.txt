You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Haha
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: After the official release of the new version, there will be more people here.
5. Designer: I guess it's because the teacher finds it annoying when people talk too much.233
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image 6]
8. P5: 233 By the way, let's see if there are any good designs to learn from.
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: Like a microcomputer.
===
Thoughts: The conversation seems to revolve around the designer's input and the community's response to the new version release. It might be interesting to explore how the community perceives good design and if they are actively seeking to learn from it. Additionally, the mention of a microcomputer could be a potential avenue to explore the technical interests of the community.

Tags for each message:
1. Disapproval
2. Humor
3. Introduction
4. Announcement
5. Speculation
6. Greeting
7. Image sharing
8. Design inspiration
9. Inquiry
10. Technical interest

Summary: The conversation starts with expressions of disapproval and humor, followed by the designer's introduction and announcement of an upcoming increase in community members. There is speculation about the reason for the increase, with a mention of annoyance towards excessive talking. The community shows interest in good design and seeks inspiration, particularly in the context of a microcomputer.

Notes: The designer's role in shaping the community's dynamics is evident, and there is a keen interest in design and technical aspects among the members. Further exploration could shed light on how the community's interactions are influenced by the designer's presence and the perceived value of good design.

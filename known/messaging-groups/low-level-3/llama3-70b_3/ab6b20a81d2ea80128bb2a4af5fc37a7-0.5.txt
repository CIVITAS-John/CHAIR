You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...

9. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary tags: feature request; content suggestion; educational focus
2. Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary tags: development roadmap; prioritization; designer response
3. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: feedback gathering; community engagement; participatory design
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; community response; designer acknowledgement
5. P4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary tags: platform inquiry; resource request; community engagement
6. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary tags: resource access; community response; gratitude
7. Designer: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: For this conversation, I'll be looking at how the online community of Physics Lab is emerging through the interactions between the designer and users. I'll be analyzing the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I'll be paying attention to how the designer responds to user requests, how users engage with the designer, and how the community is shaping the development of Physics Lab.

Tags for each message:
1. feature request; content suggestion; educational focus; mechanical waves; mechanical vibrations; wave propagation
2. development roadmap; prioritization; designer response; electrical section; magnetism
3. feedback gathering; community engagement; participatory design; user opinions; mechanics
4. appreciation; community response; designer acknowledgement; gratitude
5. platform inquiry; resource request; community engagement; PC version; interactive whiteboard
6. resource access; community response; gratitude; group files
7. image sharing; designer response; community engagement
8. update announcement; component change; ideal components; dry batteries
9. component introduction; student power supply; DC and AC support; ideal component

Summary: The conversation starts with a user requesting features for mechanical waves and optical experiments, which sets the tone for the community's engagement with the designer. The designer responds by outlining the development roadmap, prioritizing the electrical section and magnetism. The designer also expresses the need for user opinions before starting mechanics. The conversation then shifts to a user inquiring about downloading the PC version of Physics Lab, and another user expressing gratitude for accessing group files. The designer shares an image, announces an update, and introduces a new component, the student power supply.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the designer is actively engaging with the community, gathering feedback, and prioritizing development based on user input. The community is also actively participating, requesting features and resources, and expressing gratitude. This participatory design approach seems to be fostering a sense of community and collaboration.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: praising the simulation effect of the software
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

2.
Label: encourages user feedback for future development
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

3.
Label: acknowledging the workaround
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

Quotes:
- User: PC version?

5.

7.
Label: respond to developer's earlier information on feature development
Quotes:
- User: Oh, this is nice

8.
Label: development goals
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

9.
Label: adapting to user suggestions

Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

14.
Label: propose another feature
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

15.

16.
Label: asking for permission to ask that question

- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

18.
Label: proposing compromise in design choices
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

19.
Label: engaged in community support
Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

20.
Label: explain development process
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

21.
Label: ask for resources
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- User: Is there a user manual?

22.
Label: offering manual adjustment options

- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

23.
Label: upload image
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

24.
Label: encouraged user suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

25.
Label: reflect on past experience
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

26.
Label: linked to electromagnetism progress
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

27.
Label: indicating the software's appeal to a broad range of educators
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

Label: apologized for late night communication
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

29.

32.
Label: expanding on user suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

6.
Label: consideration
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

7.
Label: detailed overview of update
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

8.
Label: user input/feedback/suggestion with justifications
Quotes:

9.
Label: response to clarification
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

10.
Label: frustration
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

11.
Label: elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

12.
Label: design/feature suggestion
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

13.
Label: contextualizing response
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

14.
Label: elaboration of response
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

15.
Label: encouraging elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

16.
Label: product gap
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

17.
Label: current efforts
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

18.
Label: future update
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

19.
Label: elaboration of suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa

20.
Label: explanation
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

21.
Label: expression of interest
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

22.
Label: ethusiasm
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- User: This idea is really good

23.
Label: offering co-designing
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

24.
Label: teacher-admin interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

25.
Label: teacher response
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- User: Left side

26.
Label: teaching
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

27.
Label: comparison
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

Label: platform access
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.
- User: How to download?
- User: PC version?

Label: user type
Quotes:
- User: PC version?
- User: Yes.

31.
Label: experimental design
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

32.
Label: component simulation
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (14 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: asking for permission to ask that question
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

2.
Label: elaboration of response
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

3.
Label: ethusiasm
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- User: This idea is really good

4.
Label: communicating progress
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight
- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

5.
Label: "respect to the experts"
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

6.
Label: acknowledging community needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

7.
Label: elaboration of suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa

8.
Label: sharing info about old computer systems in school
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

9.
Label: share potential solutions
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

10.
Label: encourage future discussion or questions
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

11.
Label: compliment
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: This idea is really good

12.
Label: give a suggestion about taking the development slow
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

13.
Label: design question
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

14.
Label: confirmation/agreement of collaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

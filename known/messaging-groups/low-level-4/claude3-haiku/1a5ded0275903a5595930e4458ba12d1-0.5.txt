You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary phrases: sharing the user's teaching experience; providing more context about the target user group
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
Preliminary phrases: informing the user about the upcoming version release and the review process; demonstrating transparency
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
Preliminary phrases: apologizing for the late night disturbance; showing consideration for the user
4. User-4233: How to download?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about how to download the application; indicating interest in accessing the product
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary phrases: polite request for information; possibly following up on the previous message

Thoughts: The conversation so far provides insights into the development and release process of the Physics Lab application, as well as the engagement and feedback from the user community. The messages cover aspects such as the upcoming version release, the review process, transparency in communication, consideration for the users, and the potential for collaborative features. To further analyze the emergence of this online community, it would be helpful to consider the following theoretical perspectives:

1. Learning Sciences: Understand how the users (teachers) are engaging with the application and the potential for collaborative learning and knowledge-sharing within the community.
2. Human-Computer Interaction: Examine the design decisions and communication strategies employed by the designers to foster a positive user experience and encourage community participation.
3. Participatory Design: Explore the extent to which the users are involved in the development process and how their feedback and needs are being incorporated into the product roadmap.

9. expressing enthusiasm or positive sentiment through an emoji
10. expressing enthusiasm or positive sentiment through multiple emojis

Summary: The conversation so far suggests that the Physics Lab community is actively engaged, with both users and designers participating. The designers are demonstrating transparency in their communication, informing users about the development and release process, and showing consideration for their needs and experiences. The potential for collaborative features and the incorporation of user feedback into the product roadmap are also being discussed. The users are expressing interest in accessing the application and providing feedback, indicating a desire to be involved in the development process.

Notes: The conversation highlights the importance of clear and transparent communication between the designers and the user community, as well as the potential for collaborative learning and knowledge-sharing within the community. The designers' efforts to solicit feedback and incorporate user needs suggest a participatory design approach, which could contribute to the emergence and growth of the online community. Further analysis of the community's dynamics and the designers' strategies over time would provide additional insights into the community's evolution.

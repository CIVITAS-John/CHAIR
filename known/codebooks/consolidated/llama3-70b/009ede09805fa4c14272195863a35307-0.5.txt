You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not write repetitive ones.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Label: elicit feedback
Quotes:
- We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Feel free to share any suggestions and needs.
- Okay. Please give me more suggestions!

Label: announcement of update
Quotes:
- # New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a brief process, rather than immediately. 
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface. 
Support for undoing wire connections, component creation, and deletion. 
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current. 
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key. 

# New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter. 
Added a student power supply (AC/DC ideal power supply). 

# Adjustment of Component Properties
Dry cells now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources. 
Incandescent light bulbs now have voltage-current characteristics parameters and are no longer ideal resistors. 
The resistor law experiment now uses real formulas for calculation with adjustable parameters. 
Hidden terminals 3 and 4. 

# Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue caused by unit conversion when editing properties in the editor. 
Terminal arrows no longer display jumping animations. 
There may be calculation errors in certain circuit connections.
- Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available on the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).

Label: teacher
Quotes:
- First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
- I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
- Oh, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

- It would be convenient to have an export function, or save and import experiments. We can set the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- It is suggested to add an exit button function for the PC version, as many regions now use all-in-one touch screen computers without physical keyboards.

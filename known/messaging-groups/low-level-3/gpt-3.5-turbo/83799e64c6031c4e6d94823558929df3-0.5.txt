You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation delves into technical discussions on components like superconductors, light-sensitive components, and pressure-sensitive resistors, alongside challenges in simulation and software development. Community engagement is evident through interactions with the Designer, humor, and discussions on educational software features. Monetization ideas and community norms also surface, indicating the diverse interests and contributions shaping Physics Lab's online community.
1. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
Preliminary tags: community engagement; financial literacy
2. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
Preliminary tags: technical components; touch sensitive components
3. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?
Preliminary tags: software development; monetization
4. P14: It seems a bit troublesome.
5. P2: ……
6. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now.
7. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.
8. Designer: That's true.
9. Designer: Let's just click on ads, hh.
10. P14: Yes, that's fine.
11. P2: What's wrong with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
12. P2: A middle schooler is better than you.
13. P11: I just hope that ads won't take up too much space on the interface.
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood.
15. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method.
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: The ads won't be permanent.
19. Designer: We just want you to click on ads to earn points, and then use the points to unlock new content.
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come and hit me along the network cable.
21. P2: I know how to code.
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 280]
24. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is really annoying.
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen isn't big and it's still got psoriasis.
27. P2: It even forces you to click.
28. P2: What do you need ads for, @Designer 
29. Designer: Health...
30. Designer: Doing this requires hiring people...
31. P1: It's free.
32. Designer: Actually, it's similar to charging money, but if you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay...
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do more of it.
35. Designer: There are some other ways as well.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: values documentation in ai-generated code, value ai's code documentation and functionality
- The interviewee values the role of AI in generating well-documented and commented code.
- Users appreciate the AI's ability to provide comments and documentation for generated code and express satisfaction with the AI's ability to generate functional and well-documented code.

2.
Concepts: prefer more direct explanations from ai, express frustration with ai interactions
- Interviewees express frustration with the AI's limited options for error resolution.
- Interviewees express frustration with the AI's failure to resolve specific errors and identify points of contention, as well as express frustration with AI's error messages that do not align with their expectations.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: values documentation in ai-generated code, value ai's code documentation and functionality
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both emphasize the importance of documentation and functionality in AI-generated code, highlighting user appreciation for these aspects.
Criteria: Interviewees value the role of AI in generating well-documented and functional code, expressing satisfaction with its documentation capabilities.
Phrase: Appreciate AI's documentation and functionality.

2. 
Concepts: prefer more direct explanations from ai, express frustration with ai interactions
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both reflect user dissatisfaction with the AI's communication and error resolution capabilities, indicating a desire for clearer interactions.
Criteria: Interviewees express frustration with the AI's limited options for error resolution and prefer more direct explanations to improve their interactions.
Phrase: Desire clearer explanations from AI.

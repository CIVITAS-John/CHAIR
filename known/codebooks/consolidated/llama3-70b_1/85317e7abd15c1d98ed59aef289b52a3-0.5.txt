You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

3.
Label: user 4232 praises idea
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

4.
Label: request enhancement
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

5.
Label: provided practical advice
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

6.
Label: expressed educational need
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

7.
Label: suggest focused development
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

8.
Label: express frustration with current limitations

10.
Label: answer a concern
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

11.
Label: explanation of upcoming features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

12.
Label: share positive classroom experience
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

13.
Label: demonstrated transparency
Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

14.
Label: designer 1 provides ideal component

- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

15.
Label: designer 1 provides alternative instructions
Quotes:
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

16.
Label: highlight technical constraints
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

17.
Label: justify optimization efforts
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

18.
Label: introduce feature functoins
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

19.
Label: provide technical limitation
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

20.
Label: user 4230 contributes to content development
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

21.
Label: discuss design implications
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

22.
Label: designer 2 engages in problem solving
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

23.
Label: user 4235 reiterates need for manual
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

24.
Label: communicated ongoing optimization
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

25.
Label: indicated need for guidance
Quotes:
- User: Is there a user manual?

26.
Label: confirming teacher identity
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

27.
Label: referenced a specific user
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

28.
Label: clarified technical detail
Quotes:
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

Label: share development plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

30.
Label: set development scope
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

31.
Label: give examples of feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify low-level descriptive codes for each message.
Codes should attempt to interpret events, actors, and intents.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary codes: update announcement; feature modification; simulation enhancement
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary codes: component introduction; simulation realism; educational content development
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary codes: call for user feedback; participatory design; community engagement
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary codes: technical inquiry; pc version usage inquiry
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary codes: technical limitation; system compatibility; platform constraint
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

Thoughts: In this conversation, I'll be looking for codes that highlight the emergence of the online community around Physics Lab. I'll be considering how designers and users interact, share knowledge, and collaborate. From a learning sciences perspective, I'll examine how users are learning from each other and from the designers. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll analyze how the software is being used and the limitations that are being encountered. From a participatory design perspective, I'll investigate how users are influencing the design and development of the software.

Codes for each message:

1. update announcement; feature modification; simulation enhancement
2. component introduction; simulation realism; educational content development
3. call for user feedback; participatory design; community engagement
4. technical inquiry; pc version usage inquiry
5. image sharing
6. technical limitation; system compatibility; platform constraint
7. technical context sharing; school infrastructure description
8. system compatibility suggestion
9. system compatibility confirmation
10. gratitude expression
11. problem reporting encouragement; community support
12. software appreciation; usability feedback
13. technical solution suggestion; compatibility discussion
14. technical explanation; hardware requirement discussion
15. update announcement; version release notification

Summary: This conversation revolves around the online community of Physics Lab, where designers and users interact to discuss updates, features, and technical limitations of the software. The designers announce updates, introduce new components, and encourage user feedback, while users ask technical questions, share their experiences, and provide appreciation and feedback on the software.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with the users, encouraging feedback and suggestions. The users, on the other hand, are actively seeking help, sharing their technical contexts, and providing feedback on the software. This interaction suggests a collaborative and participatory approach to the development of Physics Lab.

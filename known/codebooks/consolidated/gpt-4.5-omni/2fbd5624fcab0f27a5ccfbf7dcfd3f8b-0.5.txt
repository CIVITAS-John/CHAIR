You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate verb phrase as label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated verb phrase of code 1}

1.
Concepts: announce updates, announce new version updates
- Designers communicate updates and announcements about changes and new components in the software to the community.
- Designers announce the release of new software versions, features, and updates.

2.
Concepts: share development plan, share development updates
- Designers share or inform users about the development plan or future updates.
- Designers share information about the current status, updates, and future plans for the software.

3.
Concepts: gather user input, solicit community input
- Designers indicate the need to gather user input before starting a new project or for future iterations.
- Designers seek and request feedback, help, consultation, or additional input from the community before starting new phases of development.

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: announce updates, announce new version updates
Relationship: Inclusion (new version updates are a specific type of updates)
Criteria: Designers communicate updates and announcements about changes and new components in the software to the community, including the release of new software versions, features, and updates.
Label: Announce software updates

2.
Concepts: share development plan, share development updates
Relationship: Parallel (both involve sharing information, but one is about plans and the other about current status)
Criteria: Designers share or inform users about the development plan or future updates, and share information about the current status, updates, and future plans for the software.
Label: Share development information

3.
Concepts: gather user input, solicit community input
Relationship: Intersection (both involve seeking input from users)
Criteria: Designers indicate the need to gather user input before starting a new project or for future iterations, and seek and request feedback, help, consultation, or additional input from the community before starting new phases of development.
Label: Solicit user feedback

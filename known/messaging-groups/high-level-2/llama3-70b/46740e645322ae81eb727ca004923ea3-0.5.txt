Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1

- "Example quote 2"

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with Designer-2 sharing an image, followed by Designer-1 asking how to upload a high-definition avatar. User-4229 asks if it's for the PC version, and Designer-1 responds, asking if User-4229 is a teacher.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to understand how Physics Lab's online community emerged. Guiding questions include: How do designers and users interact in this online space? How do they negotiate meaning and establish roles? What are the power dynamics at play?

# Community Building
## Shared Goals
Definition: Instances where community members work together towards a common goal.

- (Implicit goal of sharing knowledge and resources)

## Role Establishment
Definition: Instances where community members establish or negotiate their roles.
- "Are you a teacher?" (Designer-1)
- "Yes." (User-4229)
- (Implicit establishment of Designer-1 as a facilitator)

# Technical Affordances
## Platform Features
Definition: Instances where community members discuss or use platform features.
- "How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?" (Designer-1)
- "PC version?" (User-4229)
- (Implicit discussion of avatar upload feature)

# Social Dynamics
## Addressivity
Definition: Instances where community members address or respond to each other.
- "@Morning Tea Moonlight" (Designer-1)
- "Yes." (User-4229)
- (Implicit response to Designer-1's question)

Note: This is just an initial codebook, and you may need to refine or add codes as you continue to analyze the conversation.

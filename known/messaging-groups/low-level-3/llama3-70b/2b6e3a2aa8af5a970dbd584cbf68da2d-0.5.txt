You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (9 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...
...
9. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary codes: feature request; subject matter expertise; optical experiments
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary codes: development prioritization; electrical section focus
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary codes: feedback gathering; community involvement
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary codes: appreciation; designer acknowledgement
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary codes: platform inquiry; pc version request
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary codes: file access; group file acknowledgment
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: In this first round of coding, I will focus on describing each message with low-level codes, exploring the emergence of the online community of Physics Lab. I will consider the learning sciences perspective, examining how users and designers interact and negotiate the development of the platform. I will also draw on human-computer interaction principles to analyze the design decisions and feature requests. Finally, I will apply participatory design lens to identify instances of community involvement and feedback gathering.

Codes for each message:

1. User-4230: feature request; subject matter expertise; optical experiments; specific demonstration request
2. Designer-1: development prioritization; electrical section focus; roadmap sharing
3. Designer-1: feedback gathering; community involvement; mechanics section planning
4. User-4230: appreciation; designer acknowledgement; gratitude expression
5. User-4231: platform inquiry; pc version request; software availability question
6. User-4231: file access; group file acknowledgment; resource utilization
7. Designer-1: image sharing; visual communication; design update
8. Designer-1: component update; ideal component removal; simulation enhancement
9. Designer-1: component introduction; student power supply feature; DC/AC support

Summary: The conversation begins with a user requesting specific features for mechanical waves and optical experiments. The designer responds by outlining the development roadmap, prioritizing the electrical section. The user expresses gratitude, and another user inquires about downloading the PC version of Physics Lab. The designer shares an image, and later announces updates to components, including the removal of ideal components and the introduction of a student power supply feature.

Notes: It appears that the online community is already engaged in negotiating the development of Physics Lab, with users requesting specific features and designers sharing their roadmap and updates. The designers seem to value community involvement, gathering opinions and sharing their plans. The conversation is characterized by a sense of collaboration and mutual respect.

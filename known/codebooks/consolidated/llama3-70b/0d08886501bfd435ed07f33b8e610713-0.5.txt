You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Relationship: {The logical relationship between sub-codes in code 1}
Criteria: {Consolidated criteria of code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

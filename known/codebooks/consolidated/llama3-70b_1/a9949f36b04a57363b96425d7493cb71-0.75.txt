You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: ai limitation, describes ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as describing AI limitations implies identifying shortcomings of AI.
Criteria: Participants identify and describe limitations of AI.
Phrase: Identifying AI limitations.

2.
Concepts: evaluates ai-generated code, conducts detailed evaluation
Relationship: The concepts are complementary, as evaluating AI-generated code involves conducting a detailed assessment.
Criteria: Participants conduct thorough assessments of AI-generated code quality.
Phrase: Evaluating AI-generated code.

3.
Concepts: shares positive debugging experiences, collaborates with ai through iterative debugging
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected, as sharing positive experiences implies collaboration with AI through iterative debugging.
Criteria: Participants collaborate with AI through iterative debugging, leading to positive experiences.
Phrase: Collaborating with AI for debugging.

4.
Concepts: expressing frustration with ai-generated code
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Participants express frustration with AI-generated code or limitations.
Phrase: Expressing frustration with AI-generated code.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

22.
Label: highlighting application benefits
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

23.
Label: some users demonstrate self reliance and problem solving skills
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

24.
Label: takes leadership role
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

25.
Label: demonstrating subject knowledge
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

26.
Label: uses emojis to convey feelings or reactions
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

27.
Label: explain focus areas
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

28.
Label: with new versions addressing user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

29.
Label: suggesting development approach
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

30.
Label: justifying development decisions
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

31.

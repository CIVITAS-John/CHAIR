Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P16: ï¼‹1
2. P10: May I ask what "+1" means?
3. P11: It means I feel the same way.
4. P13: +1 means having the same opinion
5. P13: emmmm
6. P13: You can check Baidu
7. P10: Oh, got it, thanks.
8. P2: +1
9. P14: Some things inside the beaker also require payment.
10. P17: I'll take another look.
11. P4: No problem at all.

* Summary
The conversation involves participants in the Physics Lab's online message group discussing the meaning of the term "+1." Participant P10 asks for clarification, and P11 and P13 explain that "+1" signifies agreement or having the same opinion. P13 also suggests checking Baidu for more information. The conversation then shifts to other topics, including a comment about requiring payment for something inside a beaker and a participant indicating they will review something again.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we should consider how shared language and norms develop within the community (learning sciences), how the platform facilitates interaction (human-computer interaction), and how participants contribute to shaping the community (participatory design). Guiding questions might include: How do participants establish and share common understandings? What features of the platform support or hinder these interactions? How do participants' contributions shape the community's norms and practices?

# Emergence of Shared Language
## Clarification Requests
Definition: Instances where participants ask for explanations or definitions of terms or concepts.
- Example quote 1: "May I ask what '+1' means?" (P10)
- Example quote 2: "Oh, got it, thanks." (P10)
- Example quote 3: "You can check Baidu." (P13)

## Agreement Indicators
Definition: Expressions used by participants to indicate agreement or shared opinions.
- Example quote 1: "+1" (P16)
- Example quote 2: "+1" (P2)
- Example quote 3: "It means I feel the same way." (P11)

# Platform Interaction Features
## Facilitation of Quick Responses
Definition: Features or behaviors that enable rapid and efficient communication among participants.
- Example quote 1: "+1" (P16)
- Example quote 2: "+1" (P2)
- Example quote 3: "No problem at all." (P4)

## Use of External References
Definition: Recommendations or mentions of external sources for additional information.
- Example quote 1: "You can check Baidu." (P13)

# Participatory Design Elements
## Contributions Shaping Norms
Definition: Instances where participants' actions or explanations help establish community norms or practices.
- Example quote 1: "It means I feel the same way." (P11)
- Example quote 2: "+1 means having the same opinion" (P13)
- Example quote 3: "Some things inside the beaker also require payment." (P14)

## Community Support
Definition: Instances where participants offer help or express willingness to assist others.
- Example quote 1: "No problem at all." (P4)
- Example quote 2: "I'll take another look." (P17)
- Example quote 3: "Oh, got it, thanks." (P10)

By applying this codebook, we can systematically analyze how the Physics Lab's online community emerges through shared language, platform features, and participatory actions.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning names for categories based on the merging results.
Make sure those names are concise, accurate, and related to the research question. Use 2-4 words and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Names for each category (13 in total):

1. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a lot of computational power...
2. P1: If you can create a free and comprehensive one, it should be very popular.
3. P2: If the CPU is not good, then it's over.
4. P11: If you add all these things you mentioned, it won't be a "Physics Lab" anymore. 23333
5. P1: It's a series of lab classes.
6. P11: Hey, good idea.
7. P2: Hehe.
8. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is asking for trouble?
9. P2: @Designer Can light-sensitive components be added?
10. Designer: The question is,
11. Designer: Where does the light come from?
12. P11: What about light?
13. Designer: Do you use a small light bulb to shine on the light-sensitive resistor?
14. P2: Touch it with your hand.
15. P14: I think there's no problem.
16. Designer: So, it's just a potentiometer, except the curve is different (...)
17. P2: And a small light.
18. Designer: Maybe a small fee...
19. Designer: Six yuan per month for a wallet = =
20. P2: ï¼Ÿ
21. P14: [Image]
22. Designer: Let's talk about it later.
23. Designer: You can click on ads even if you don't have money.
24. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
25. P1: Let's put up some ads.
26. Designer: Hmm.
27. P14: 
28. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
29. Designer: Oh.
30. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).

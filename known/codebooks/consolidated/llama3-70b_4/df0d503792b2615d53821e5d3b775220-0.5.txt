You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: engage with suggestions, provide design support and feedback
Relationship: The concepts are closely related as they both describe users' active participation in the design process, with "engage with suggestions" being a more general concept and "provide design support and feedback" being a more specific way of doing so.
Criteria: Users contribute to the design process by engaging with suggestions and providing support and feedback.
Phrase: Providing design input.

2.
Concepts: share development insights
Relationship: The concepts are closely related as they both describe designers' actions of sharing information with users, with "share development process and plans" being a more general concept and "share information about development plans and provide resources" being a more specific way of doing so.
Criteria: Designers inform users about development plans and processes by sharing insights and resources.
Phrase: Sharing development updates.

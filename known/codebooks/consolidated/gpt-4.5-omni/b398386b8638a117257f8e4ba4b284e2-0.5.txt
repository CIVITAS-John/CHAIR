You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1. feature requests, feedback and suggestions.
- Instances where users suggest new features or improvements to the software.
- Users provide feedback and suggestions to improve the software.

2. feedback loop, designer responsiveness.
- Instances where users provide feedback and the designer acknowledges or responds to it.
- Instances where the designer responds to and incorporates user feedback.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Relationship: The sub-codes are parallel as they both deal with user input aimed at improving the software.
Criteria: Instances where users suggest new features or improvements, or provide feedback and suggestions for the software.
Label: User Input
Category: User Participation

2.
Relationship: The sub-codes are parallel as they both involve the interaction between users providing feedback and designers responding to it.
Criteria: Instances where users provide feedback and the designer acknowledges, responds to, or incorporates this feedback.

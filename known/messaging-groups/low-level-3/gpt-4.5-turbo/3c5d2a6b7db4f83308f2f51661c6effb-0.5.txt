You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Hello
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: There will be more people here once the official version is released.
5. Designer: Probably because the teacher finds too much talking annoying ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image 1-6]
8. P5: ðŸ˜‚ By the way, I'm here to see if there are any good designs to reference.
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: For example, a microcomputer.

Thoughts: Analyzing this conversation involves looking at the stages of community formation and interaction within Physics Lab's online platform. From a learning sciences perspective, it's essential to consider how participants are engaging with each other and the content. In human-computer interaction, the use of emojis and images could indicate non-verbal communication methods adapted to the digital environment. Lastly, from a participatory design viewpoint, the exchange about design references suggests that users are involved in co-creating or providing feedback on the platform's development. Key questions include: How are participants interacting with each other and the designer? What does the use of informal communication (emojis, casual greetings) say about the community culture? How are users contributing to the platform's design?

Tags for each message:
1. expressing disapproval; non-verbal cues; initiating interaction
2. greeting; initiating conversation; community engagement
3. designer response; greeting; interaction
4. community growth anticipation; designer communication; user engagement
5. humor in communication; designer-user interaction; community culture
6. greeting; participant response; community engagement
7. sharing resources; visual communication; participant contribution
8. seeking inspiration; community collaboration; design interest
9. seeking clarification; designer engagement; interactive questioning
10. specific design example; participant contribution; design discussion

Summary: The conversation starts with a mix of casual greetings and light-hearted remarks among the participants and the designer. The designer actively participates, hinting at future community growth and the current social norms (e.g., limited talking due to teacher preferences). Participants are not only engaging socially but are also starting to touch upon the core purpose of the platform, which revolves around design and learning. The use of an image and emojis suggests that the platform supports various forms of communication, enhancing user interaction. One participant explicitly mentions looking for design references, indicating a collaborative and participatory approach to learning and design within the community.

Notes: The use of casual language and emojis might suggest a relaxed community atmosphere that could encourage more open and frequent interactions. The mention of a microcomputer by a participant highlights the technical and design-oriented nature of discussions expected on the platform. This early stage of community interaction could be crucial for setting the tone and expectations of the community culture. It would be important to monitor how these interactions evolve with the official release and increased user base.

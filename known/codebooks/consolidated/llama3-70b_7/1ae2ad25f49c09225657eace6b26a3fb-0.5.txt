You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: ðŸ˜‚

2.
Label: providing user feedback
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
More realistic 3D appearance for various meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeter and meter zeroing.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments
Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal/realistic modes.

# Special Tips
The Esc shortcut key will now minimize the window.
The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

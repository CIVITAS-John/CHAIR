1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: propose advanced features for user assessment; enhance educational utility; indicate thoughtful design considerations
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: validate positive feedback; reinforce community support for ideas; encourage ongoing dialogue
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: commit to consulting the community; promote participatory design; ensure user involvement in decision making
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Preliminary phrases: seek expert input from community educators; engage users in relevant discussions; validate teacher perspectives
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: confirm understanding of design elements; promote clarity in communication; ensure alignment with user needs
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: validate user input on common practices; reinforce community knowledge; support collaborative decision making
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

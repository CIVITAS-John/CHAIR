You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (15 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...
...
15. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary codes: component update; ideal component removal; simulation enhancement
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary codes: component introduction; student power supply feature; dc/ac support
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary codes: feedback solicitation; community engagement
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary codes: usage inquiry; pc version guidance
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary codes: system compatibility; xp system limitation
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

Thoughts: 
For this first round of coding, I will focus on describing each message with low-level codes, exploring the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will examine the interactions between designers and users, identifying key events, actors, and intents. I will also consider how the online community is emerging and how the designers are engaging with users.

6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
system compatibility; xp system limitation

7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
school computer system; outdated infrastructure

8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
alternative system suggestion

9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
system compatibility confirmation

10. User-4232: Thank you.
politeness; appreciation

11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
problem reporting encouragement; community support

12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
software appreciation; usability praise

13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
xp compatibility consideration; potential solution

14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
compatibility explanation; system requirement clarification

15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
version update announcement; community notification

Summary:
The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community, where designers and users interact. Designers introduce new components, solicit feedback, and provide guidance on using the software. Users ask questions, share images, and express appreciation for the software. The conversation touches on system compatibility issues, with designers and users discussing XP system limitations and potential solutions.

Notes:
The designers seem to be actively engaging with users, encouraging feedback and providing support. The community is emerging as a collaborative space where users can share their experiences and receive guidance. The conversation highlights the importance of system compatibility and the designers' efforts to address these issues.

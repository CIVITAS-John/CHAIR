1. P4230: Okay okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
3. P4231: I saw the files in the group, thank you.
4. Designer: [Image 14]
5. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.
7. Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. P4232: How to use the PC version?
9. P4232: [Image 19]
10. P8: It does not support the XP system.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label: A label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Here is a codebook to analyze the factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research on how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

## Participatory Design
Definition: Instances where the designers actively seek input and feedback from the community members to inform the design process.
- "When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group"
- "Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?"
- "Thank you all for your support. We will do better!"

## Community Engagement
Definition: Instances where the community members actively participate and provide feedback to the designers.
- "This idea is really good"
- "Yes, the common one is still the old style"
- "But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing"

## Iterative Development
Definition: Instances where the designers demonstrate a willingness to refine and improve the product based on community feedback.
- "Make it simpler..."
- "So, use both?"
- "This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results"

## Transparency and Communication
Definition: Instances where the designers communicate openly about the development process and upcoming updates.
- "We are working on this part"
- "There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend."
- "The update is quite large..."

## Anticipation and Excitement
Definition: Instances where the community members express anticipation or excitement about the product updates.
- "Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]"

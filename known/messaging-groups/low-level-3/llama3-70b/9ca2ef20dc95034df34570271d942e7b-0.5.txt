You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (18 in total):
1. {interpretation of message 1}; {another}; ...
...
18. {interpretation of message 18}; {another}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: Thank you.
Preliminary codes: appreciation; politeness; social norm
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary codes: open communication; support; community building
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary codes: software evaluation; practicality; user experience
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary codes: xp compatibility; technical consideration; future development
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary codes: theoretical compatibility; technical explanation; design consideration
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary codes: update announcement; version release; community notification
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

Thoughts: In this first round of coding, I will focus on identifying the emerging themes and patterns in the conversation. I will analyze the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will pay attention to the designers' and users' interactions, their concerns, and suggestions. I will also explore how the online community is being shaped and how the designers are responding to users' feedback.

Codes for each message:

1. Appreciation; politeness; social norm
2. Open communication; support; community building
3. Software evaluation; practicality; user experience
4. XP compatibility; technical consideration; future development
5. Theoretical compatibility; technical explanation; design consideration
6. Update announcement; version release; community notification
7. Feature announcement; software development; community engagement
8. Feature suggestion; user experience; accessibility
9. Response to feedback; development priority; community engagement
10. Feature suggestion; user experience; accessibility
11. Technical discussion; design consideration; accessibility
12. Technical discussion; design consideration; accessibility
13. Personal anecdote; technical discussion; design consideration
14. Agreement; social norm; community building
15. Feature suggestion; user experience; convenience
16. Response to feedback; development priority; community engagement
17. Technical inquiry; infrastructure; classroom setting
18. Technical constraint; infrastructure; classroom setting

Summary: The conversation starts with a user expressing appreciation and the designers encouraging open communication. The user provides positive feedback on the software, and the designers discuss technical considerations and announce an update. The conversation then shifts to feature suggestions, with the user requesting an exit button function and the designers discussing accessibility features. The conversation also touches on the classroom setting and the limitations of the school's infrastructure.

Notes: The designers seem to be actively engaging with the user, responding to feedback, and prioritizing development. The user is providing valuable feedback and suggestions, which is shaping the development of the software. The conversation highlights the importance of accessibility and user experience in the design of the software. The classroom setting and infrastructure constraints are also emerging as important considerations.

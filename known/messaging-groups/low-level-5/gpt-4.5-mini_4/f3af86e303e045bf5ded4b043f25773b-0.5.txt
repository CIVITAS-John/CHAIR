You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (10 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
10. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary phrases: share professional background; provide context for teaching experience; establish credibility
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
Preliminary phrases: inform users about software updates; manage expectations; communicate timelines
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
Preliminary phrases: apologize for potential inconvenience; show consideration for users; maintain community etiquette
4. User-4233: How to download?
Preliminary phrases: seek guidance on software usage; express curiosity; initiate inquiry
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary phrases: request clarification; indicate need for assistance; engage with the community
6. Designer-2: Group sharing.
Preliminary phrases: suggest collaborative features; promote community interaction; encourage sharing of resources
7. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
9. User-4234: [Emoji 2-56]
10. User-4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]

Thoughts: In this round of coding, I will analyze the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will focus on how users and designers interact to shape the online community of Physics Lab. Key questions include: How do users share their experiences and needs? How do designers respond to those needs and facilitate community engagement? What role do emojis play in communication and community building? 

Interpretation phrases for each item (10 in total):
1. share professional background; provide context for teaching experience; establish credibility
2. inform users about software updates; manage expectations; communicate timelines
3. apologize for potential inconvenience; show consideration for users; maintain community etiquette
4. seek guidance on software usage; express curiosity; initiate inquiry
5. request clarification; indicate need for assistance; engage with the community
6. suggest collaborative features; promote community interaction; encourage sharing of resources
7. provide practical instructions for downloading; facilitate access to materials; support user needs
8. announce upcoming updates; invite user feedback on features; express commitment to community input
9. express emotions or reactions; contribute to community atmosphere; engage non-verbally
10. express emotions or reactions; enhance community bonding; engage non-verbally

Summary: The conversation illustrates the emergence of the Physics Lab online community through interactions between users and designers. Users share their backgrounds and inquire about software usage, while designers provide updates, invite feedback, and demonstrate consideration for community norms. The use of emojis by users further enriches the communication, adding emotional depth and fostering a sense of belonging.

Notes: The conversation highlights the importance of user feedback in participatory design, as designers actively solicit input on features. The blend of professional sharing and casual communication (like emojis) suggests a growing community where users feel comfortable engaging with one another and with the designers. Future analyses could explore the impact of such interactions on user engagement and community sustainability.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: provide update
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

Label: manage expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

Label: suggest improvements
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

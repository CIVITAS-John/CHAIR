You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: When analyzing these messages, it is important to consider how humor and social bonding contribute to the emergence of the online community. The repetitive use of "+1" might indicate a shared cultural norm or meme within the community. Additionally, the clarification and explanation requests highlight the learning dynamics and user support mechanisms in place. Questions to consider include: How do humor and repetition foster community interaction? How does the community handle newcomers or those unfamiliar with its norms?

Summary: The conversation primarily revolves around the use of the term "+1," which signifies agreement or shared sentiment within the community. P14's initial self-deprecating comment sets a humorous tone, which is echoed by others through the repetitive use of "+1." P10's request for clarification indicates a gap in understanding, which is promptly addressed by P11 and P13, showcasing the community's supportiveness and willingness to educate. P13's suggestion to check Baidu introduces an external resource, further aiding in understanding.

Notes: The use of humor and repetition seems to play a significant role in bonding and creating a sense of community. The quick response to P10's query demonstrates a supportive environment conducive to learning. The reference to Baidu suggests that the community might rely on external resources for clarification, indicating a blend of internal and external learning tools. This interaction highlights the community's participatory nature, where members actively contribute to each other's understanding and sense of belonging.

1. 呃……左边还是右边

2. 我们正在做这块
---
3. 左侧
---
4. 打点简单点。。
---
5. 不过不交叉的用右侧的比较好
---
6. 也就是两个都用？

7. 这版本的电路图仅供测试。。。会可以拖动Editor，因为自动排版算法还不是很稳定，可能会产生比较奇葩的结果
---
8. 感谢大家支持。会做的更好！
---
9. 这周会有更新吗？[Emoji]
---

1. Uh... left side or right side
---
2. We are working on this part

3. Left side
---
4. Make it simpler...
---
5. But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
---
6. So, use both?
---
7. This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
---
8. Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

9. Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]

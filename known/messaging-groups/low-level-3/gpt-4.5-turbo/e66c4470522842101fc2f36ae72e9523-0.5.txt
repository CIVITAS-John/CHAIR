You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: The current set of messages appears to focus on a mix of social interactions and community norms, particularly around the use of the term "+1." Understanding how participants use shorthand expressions like "+1" and how these terms are explained and adopted by newcomers can provide insights into the community's communication patterns and norms. The explanatory responses also suggest a supportive environment where members are willing to help each other understand the community's linguistic conventions. Analyzing these interactions can reveal how community culture and language evolve and how inclusivity is managed within the online platform.

Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. self-deprecating humor; expressing individuality; social interaction
2. agreement with previous message; social interaction; supportive response
3. agreement expression; social interaction; community engagement
4. expression of agreement; social interaction; community involvement
5. inquiry about community slang; seeking clarification; participant engagement
6. explanation of term; community support; informative response
7. clarification of community slang; supportive communication; social interaction
8. expression of hesitation; non-verbal filler; social interaction
9. suggestion for self-help; directing to external resource; social interaction

Summary: The conversation revolves around the use of the term "+1," which is commonly used to indicate agreement or endorsement in online communities. P10, possibly a newer member, inquires about the meaning of "+1," prompting responses from P11 and P13, who explain that it signifies agreement or a shared opinion. P13's series of messages, including a non-verbal expression ("emmmm") and a suggestion to use an external search engine, adds layers to the social dynamics, illustrating both a direct and indirect approach to community support and knowledge sharing.

Notes: The use of "+1" and its explanation could indicate a stage of acculturation for new members within the community. The readiness of other participants to explain community norms suggests a welcoming and inclusive environment. The suggestion by P13 to use Baidu for further information might indicate a reliance on external resources for community education, which could be explored further in terms of how it affects self-sufficiency and empowerment within the community. The mix of direct and indirect communication styles could also be a point of interest in studying the community's interaction patterns and their impact on participant engagement and learning.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: carefully evaluates ai-generated code, testing and comparing ai-generated code
- Users thoroughly evaluate AI-generated code to ensure its effectiveness.
- Users test AI-generated code patterns and capabilities, comparing them with their initial code and outputs from different sources.

2.
Concepts: refining model setup and structure, fixing and refining ai-generated code
- Participants refine their model setup based on AI-generated code and set up a model structure before using AI assistance.
- Users fix errors in AI-generated code through an iterative process, engaging in iterative model building with AI assistance.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: carefully evaluates ai-generated code, testing and comparing ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as evaluating and testing are essential steps in comparing AI-generated code with initial code and outputs from different sources.
Criteria: Users thoroughly evaluate and test AI-generated code to ensure its effectiveness and compare it with their initial code and outputs from different sources.
Phrase: Evaluates and tests AI-generated code.

2.
Concepts: refining model setup and structure, fixing and refining ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as refining the model setup and structure is a precursor to fixing and refining AI-generated code, which is an iterative process.
Criteria: Users refine their model setup and structure before fixing and refining AI-generated code through an iterative process.
Phrase: Refines and fixes AI-generated code.

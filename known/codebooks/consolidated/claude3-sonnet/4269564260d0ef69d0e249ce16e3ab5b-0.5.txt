You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* community design dynamics
* collaboration 
* user roles
=> Community Dynamics & Roles

* knowledge sharing dynamics
* iterative co-development cycle
=> Knowledge Co-creation Processes

# Reflection
- The "Community Dynamics & Roles" category seems reasonable as it covers aspects related to how the community operates and the roles people play within it.
- The "Knowledge Co-creation Processes" category captures the iterative cycles of knowledge sharing and co-development that likely occurred.
- No additional categories seem necessary to merge based on the provided codes.
- The naming seems accurate and concise enough to cover the merged aspects.

# Final Merging 
* community design dynamics
* collaboration
* user roles  
=> Community Dynamics & Roles

* knowledge sharing dynamics
* iterative co-development cycle
=> Knowledge Co-creation Processes

        "Tolerance in Middle School Exams | Topic | 785 words Tolerance is a virtue; tolerance is a state of mind; tolerance brings two hearts closer together; tolerance merges the poles of the Earth. Tolerance, like a blooming flower, fragrances the entire spring; tolerance, like a dense tree, cools the entire summer; tolerance, like a fiery maple, ignites the entire autumn; tolerance, like a shocking snow, silences the entire winter. Those who possess tolerance, are like owning a sea, embracing countless rivers; those who possess tolerance, are like owning a sky, accommodating countless birds; those who possess tolerance, are like owning a desert, gathering countless sands. Tolerance is something everyone should have, it is the magnanimity of a gentleman, the generosity of a gentleman-like demeanor. During the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu staged the story of \"three angers\". They agreed that whoever captured Nanjun first would own it. Zhuge Liang took advantage of Zhou Yu's deep thoughts on how to attack the city and captured Nanjun unexpectedly, which was the first anger. The second anger is the famous: Zhou Yu's clever plan secured the world, but at the cost of his wife and troops. He intended to use a beauty trap to keep Liu Bei, but Zhuge Liang discovered it, used a strategy to bring Liu Bei and his wife back, and then loudly mocked Zhou Yu at the bow of the ship. The third anger was because Zhou Yu used the \"borrowing a path to destroy Guo\" strategy, he wanted to take Jingzhou, but falsely claimed to take Hanzhong first, hoping to capture Liu Bei by surprise, but in the end, Zhuge Liang discovered it. In the end, because his strategies were repeatedly seen through by Zhuge Liang, he fell seriously ill and died soon after, his last words were a lament to the heavens: \"Having born Yu, why also Liang?\" Zhou Yu died of anger, from a young age he was talented in both literature and martial arts, but what he lacked was a breadth of mind, a magnanimity. In this world, since we cannot find two identical leaves, then there are no two identical people, everyone has their own personality, pursuits, habits, specialties, everyone has their own way of life, ways of handling things, thinking habits. Therefore, it's normal to have some disagreements between people, as long as we have a tolerant heart, to empathize, respect, and understand others, we can gain a kind of happiness, a kind of enjoyment, a kind of comfort. Tolerance is a mountain, capable of accommodating flowers as well as thorns; capable of accommodating towering trees as well as delicate grass; tolerance is the spring rain, able to melt solid ice, awakening dormant love; tolerance is the autumn wind, able to disperse the clouds of inferiority, calling back lost conscience. Tolerance is cultivation, understanding, caring and consideration, tolerance is giving, devotion, a crescent moon, a piece of rosy clouds."

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with interpretation phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with phrases. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Preliminary phrases: last time i tried it in middle school; there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right; and when the browser pops up; it's no longer full screen... = = designer 1 shares a personal anecdote; illustrating a workaround for on screen keyboards
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: @ designer 1 yes; yes. user 4232 acknowledges and agrees with designer 1's explanation
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: if there could be an export function; or the ability to save or import experiments; it would be convenient. we could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class. user 4232 suggests adding an export or import function; highlighting the potential benefits for teachers
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: there will be. designer 1 responds to user 4232's suggestion; indicating that the feature is planned or in development
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: does the class have internet? designer 1 inquires about the internet availability in the classroom; considering the implications for the software's usage
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: generally not. ever since an adult image popped up during a major city level open class; the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [ emoji 2 41]. user 4232 explains the lack of internet in the classroom; sharing a humorous anecdote about the reason behind the restriction
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: highlighting ai's promptness and effectiveness, noting ai-driven efficiency benefits and fast iteration potential
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they all describe the positive aspects of AI, specifically its promptness, effectiveness, and efficiency benefits.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge AI's capabilities and benefits in terms of speed and efficiency.
Phrase: Acknowledge AI's efficiency benefits.

2.
Concepts: benefit of ai - saves time, prefers ai solutions over prolonged problem-solving
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both describe the time-saving benefits of AI and the preference for AI solutions over traditional problem-solving methods.
Criteria: Participants recognize the time-saving benefits of AI and prefer AI-driven solutions.
Phrase: Prefer AI solutions for time-saving.

3.
Concepts: expressing frustration with documentation, expressing frustration with coding tools and inefficiencies
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both describe the negative experiences and frustrations with current documentation and coding tools.
Criteria: Participants express frustration with current documentation and coding tools due to inefficiencies.
Phrase: Express frustration with current tools.

4.
Concepts: identify ai mistakes, focus on error messages
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as they both describe the critical evaluation of AI's performance, specifically identifying mistakes and analyzing error messages.
Criteria: Participants critically evaluate AI's performance by identifying mistakes and analyzing error messages.
Phrase: Critique AI's performance.

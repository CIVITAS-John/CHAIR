You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
2. {Repeat the input 2}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 2}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 2}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 2}

~~~
1. platform limitation, circuit diagram limitations
- Refers to limitations or restrictions of Physics Lab due to platform or system constraints.
- Limitations or constraints of circuit diagrams or simulations.

2. community involvement and engagement
- A statement encouraging or involving community participation, including quotes that encourage or facilitate engagement within the community.
- Contributions, inputs, or feedback from the community on design or functionality decisions.

Definitions for each code:

1. platform limitation, circuit diagram limitations
Relationship: Inclusive (platform limitations include circuit diagram limitations)
Criteria: Refers to any constraint or restriction of Physics Lab due to system or platform constraints, including limitations of circuit diagrams or simulations.
Label: System Constraints

2. community involvement and engagement
Relationship: Parallel (community involvement and engagement are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Refers to instances of community participation, feedback, or encouragement that facilitate engagement within the Physics Lab online community.
Label: Community Participation

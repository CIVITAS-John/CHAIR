You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: easy to understand, supporting novices through useful features
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as ease of understanding enhances the user experience, particularly for novices, making the tool more approachable and supportive through its features.
Criteria: Users appreciate various features that enhance understanding and ease of use, particularly highlighting the importance of debugging tools that support both beginners and experienced programmers in grasping their code.
Phrase: Enhances understanding through supportive features.

2.
Concepts: evaluate ai's code output, engage in detailed evaluation
Relationship: Both concepts focus on the critical assessment of AI-generated code outputs, emphasizing the importance of accuracy and thorough evaluation to inform subsequent user actions.
Criteria: Users actively evaluate the accuracy of AI-generated code and engage in detailed assessments to guide their programming actions.
Phrase: Conducts detailed evaluation of AI code outputs.

3.
Concepts: critique tool limitations effectively, critiques ai's analytical limitations
Relationship: The concepts relate to the overall assessment of limitations, where users critique both the tools available and the specific analytical capacities of the AI, emphasizing user engagement and technical compatibility.
Criteria: Interviewees effectively critique the limitations of both NetLogo's functionalities and the AI's capacity to handle specific tasks, particularly engaging with issues of compatibility and dataset management.
Phrase: Critiques limitations of tools and AI.

4.
Concepts: recognizing ai limitations, limitation: human's ability is limited
Relationship: The concepts highlight a dual recognition of limitations where users not only identify constraints in AI systems but also reflect on their own human capacities, establishing a relationship between trust in AI solutions and self-awareness of problem-solving boundaries.
Criteria: Users recognize both the inherent limitations of AI systems and reflect on their own limited experiences, conveying a degree of trust in AI-generated solutions while acknowledging human constraints.
Phrase: Acknowledges limitations of AI and human capacity.

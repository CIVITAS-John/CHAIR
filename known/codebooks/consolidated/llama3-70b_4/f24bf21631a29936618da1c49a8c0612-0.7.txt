You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: demonstrating transparency
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

2.
Label: emphasizing categorization and prioritization
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

3.
Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

4.
Label: demonstrating familiarity with educational settings
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

5.
Label: utilizing shared materials
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

6.
Label: explaining that the school has disabled the network on classroom computers due to an incident with inappropriate content during a major open class
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

7.
Label: gather detailed requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

8.
Label: introducing component customization
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

9.
Label: confirm common style
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

10.
Label: updating on review process
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

11.
Label: explains reasons for schools disabling network on classroom computers
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

12.
Label: greets users with a smile
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

13.
Label: the conversation indicates an iterative development process influenced by user feedback and educational needs
Quotes:

14.
Label: resource request
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

15.
Label: adapting to user constraints
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

16.
Label: outlining a plan for simulated experiment assessment
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

17.
Label: encouraging elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

18.
Label: building relationships with users
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

19.
Label: as well as adjustments to component properties and bug fixes
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.

20.
Label: providing a suggestion to focus on categorization and refinement rather than completeness
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

21.
Label: inquiring about platform specifics
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

22.
Label: give examples of feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

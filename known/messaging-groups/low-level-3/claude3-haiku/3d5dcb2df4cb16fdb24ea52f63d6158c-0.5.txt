You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P4230: First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~
Preliminary tags: wave demonstrations; optics experiments; user feedback
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing electricity first, then magnetism, and then other sections.
Preliminary tags: development prioritization; electricity; magnetism
3. Designer: We will gather more opinions before starting mechanics~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: user feedback; development planning
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation
5. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
Preliminary tags: pc/interactive whiteboard download; user question
6. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
Preliminary tags: file download; appreciation
7. Designer: [Image 14]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: The conversation so far provides insights into the development and user feedback for the Physics Lab application. The initial message from P4230 suggests that the user is interested in dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves, vibrations, and optical experiments, indicating a desire for more advanced features. The designer's response suggests that the development team is prioritizing completing the electricity and magnetism sections first, before moving on to other areas. This implies a strategic approach to the development process, likely based on user feedback or other considerations. The subsequent messages indicate that the designer is open to gathering more user opinions before proceeding with the mechanics section, suggesting a collaborative approach to the development. The user's appreciation for the designer's hard work and the successful download of the files also suggest a positive user experience. Overall, the conversation provides a glimpse into the early stages of the Physics Lab community's emergence, with a focus on user feedback, development prioritization, and a collaborative approach to the application's evolution.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
A conversation between a designer and a community member, P4229, about uploading a high-definition avatar and discussing the community member's profession as a teacher.

* Plan
Analyze the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to understand how the Physics Lab's online community emerged. Guiding questions: How do community members negotiate technical aspects of the platform? How do they establish relationships and build trust? What roles do community members take on, and how do they influence the community's development?

# Technical Aspects
## Avatar Customization
Definition: Discussion about customizing or uploading avatars on the platform.
- "How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?"
- "I'll upload one now..."
- [Image 2-0] (assuming the image is related to the avatar)

# Community Building
## Establishing Relationships
Definition: Instances where community members establish or inquire about each other's identities, roles, or backgrounds.
- "Are you a teacher?"
- "Yes."

# Roles and Identities
## Professional Roles
Definition: Discussion or mention of community members' professional roles or occupations.
- "Are you a teacher?"
- "Yes."

Let me know if you'd like me to add or modify any codes!

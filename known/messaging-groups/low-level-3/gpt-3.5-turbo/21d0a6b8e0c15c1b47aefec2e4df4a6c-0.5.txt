Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in the Physics Lab community continues to revolve around a mix of topics, including discussions on software features, astronomical concepts, and user inquiries to the designer. Users engage in sharing knowledge, seeking clarification on software functionalities, and providing suggestions for the software's development. The designer actively participates in the dialogue, responding to user inquiries, incorporating feedback into the development process, and hinting at future features, fostering a participatory design approach within the online community.
1. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
Preliminary tags: technical inquiry
2. Designer: Two types of motors.
Preliminary tags: motor types
3. P1: Are you on the server?
Preliminary tags: technical inquiry
4. P2: Brushed motor.
5. P2: Brushless motors are not connected to AC.
6. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
7. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
8. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
9. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple to follow the method I mentioned @Designer 
10. P14: [Image 168]
11. P2: What if it burns?
12. P4: Just power it on and play a rotating animation, that's it ðŸ˜‚
13. P2: Do we still need algorithms?
14. P4: ðŸ˜‚ Simple and done.
15. P2: Algorithms are not simple.
16. P2: You can also add IGDT @Designer 
17. P13: [Image 175]
18. P13: Are you all fake?
19. P13: Are you from outer space?
20. P13: I don't understand.
21. P2: Transistors can also be used.
22. Designer: You can make some interesting components, but normal experiments shouldn't be done like this...
23. P11: ðŸ˜‚ That's in electronic circuits.
24. P11: I don't understand either.
25. P2: It's in the CPU.
26. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned some when I took an optional course in circuits.
27. P2: Add a capacitive divider.
28. P2: I learned it by myself.
29. P11: That's great, especially if you have a hobby in it.
30. P14: @P11 Are there still distinctions between arts and sciences now?
31. P2: no
32. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
33. P14: [Image 191]
34. P14: ...Let me pass the exam first.
35. P2: I'm still in the second year of junior high school.

Thoughts: In analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, consider looking at it through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Look for instances of knowledge sharing, learning processes, user engagement with the software, interactions with the designer, and the emergence of community norms and practices. Explore how users navigate technical concepts, how the designer facilitates learning and engagement, and how participatory design principles manifest in the community interactions.

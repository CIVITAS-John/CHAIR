Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label: A label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

## ...

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Here is a codebook to analyze the factors that could contribute to the research question "How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?":

## Code 1: Community Engagement
Definition: This code refers to the level of engagement and participation from the users in the online community of Physics Lab.
- "First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request." (User-4230)
- "Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work." (User-4230)
- "Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?" (User-4231)

## Code 2: Responsiveness of Designers
Definition: This code refers to the designers' responsiveness and willingness to address the users' requests and feedback.
- "Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts." (Designer-1)
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything." (Designer-1)
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate)." (Designer-1)

## Code 3: Iterative Design Process
Definition: This code refers to the designers' approach to the development of Physics Lab, which involves gathering feedback and iterating on the design.
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything." (Designer-1)
- "The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component." (Designer-1)
- "[Image 2-14]" (Designer-1)

## Code 4: Transparency and Communication
Definition: This code refers to the level of transparency and communication between the designers and the users of Physics Lab.
- "Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts." (Designer-1)
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate)." (Designer-1)
- "The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component." (Designer-1)

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

7. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.
8. Designer: That's true.
9. Designer: Let's just click on ads, hh.
10. P14: Yes, that's fine.
11. P2: What's wrong with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
12. P2: A middle schooler is better than you.
13. P11: I just hope that ads won't take up too much space on the interface.
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood.
15. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method.
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: The ads won't be permanent.
19. Designer: We just want you to click on ads to earn points, and then use the points to unlock new content.
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come and hit me along the network cable.
21. P2: I know how to code.
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 280]
24. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is really annoying.
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen isn't big and it's still got psoriasis.
27. P2: It even forces you to click.
28. P2: What do you need ads for, @Designer 
29. Designer: Health...
30. Designer: Doing this requires hiring people...
31. P1: It's free.
32. Designer: Actually, it's similar to charging money, but if you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay...
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do more of it.
35. Designer: There are some other ways as well.
36. P8: The points wall is okay.
37. P8: @Designer I think it's okay.
38. P14: I also think it's great.
39. Designer: Actually, you can learn that mini program.
40. Designer: Creating questions, reviewing questions, and answering questions.
41. P14: What do you mean?
42. P14: [Image 299]
43. P17: Brain Out.
44. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
45. P18: Just downloaded it.

Thoughts: This conversation highlights several aspects of community engagement and participatory design in the Physics Lab online community. There is a blend of technical discussion, user experience feedback, and playful banter that enriches the community's dynamics. The discussion about payment methods and ad integration particularly underscores the participatory design, as users and the Designer together explore feasible solutions. It's important to look at how the community addresses the balance between monetization and user experience, and how users of different ages and technical abilities interact with these proposals. Also, the introduction of gamification elements like points for ads clicks indicates an intersection of human-computer interaction and learning sciences, where user engagement could potentially enhance learning outcomes.

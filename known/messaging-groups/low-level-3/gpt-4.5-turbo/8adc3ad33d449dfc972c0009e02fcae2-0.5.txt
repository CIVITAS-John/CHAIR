You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
10. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer: Done.
Preliminary tags: task completion confirmation; designer response
2. P5: Good ðŸ˜‚
Preliminary tags: positive feedback; use of emoji
3. P8: @Designer  we need an admin here.
Preliminary tags: call for moderation; user designer interaction
4. P13: Are all the members in this group top students?
Preliminary tags: inquiry about group composition; social dynamics
5. P14: Except me.
Preliminary tags: self deprecating humor; community interaction
6. P13: ï¼‹1
Preliminary tags: agreement expression; social interaction
7. P15: Plus one more.
8. P16: ï¼‹1
9. P10: May I ask what does "+1" mean?
10. P11: It means "me too".

Thoughts: The conversation snippets provided appear to showcase various aspects of community building and interaction within the Physics Lab's online community. It's essential to look at how members communicate, use humor, express agreement, and seek clarifications to understand the emerging social norms and etiquettes. Additionally, the role of the Designer in facilitating and moderating the community needs to be explored further. How members relate to each other and to authority figures (like the Designer) can provide insights into the hierarchy and governance of the community.

3. call for moderation; user-designer interaction
4. inquiry about group composition; social dynamics
5. self-deprecating humor; community interaction
6. agreement expression; social interaction
7. expression of agreement; community dynamics
8. agreement confirmation; social interaction
9. seeking clarification; community learning
10. explanation given; community support

Summary: The conversation snippets from the Physics Lab's online community reveal various facets of community interaction and development. The Designer's brief message indicates task completion, suggesting an active role in the community's operational aspects. The interactions among members, such as using emojis, humor, and expressions of agreement (+1), highlight a friendly, informal communication style. Queries about group composition and the meaning of common online expressions indicate a mix of curiosity and a need for clarity among members, which fosters a learning environment within the community.

Notes: The use of "+1" and its clarification shows that community members are engaged and willing to assist each other, which is a positive sign of community health. The mention of needing an admin by P8 and the response from the Designer could imply a need for more structured governance or clearer roles within the community. The mix of humor and serious inquiries suggests a diverse group that is still negotiating its social norms. Future analysis should consider looking deeper into how these interactions contribute to a sense of belonging and identity within the Physics Lab community.

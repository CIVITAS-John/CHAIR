You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

3.
Label: considering user experience in different modes
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

4.
Label: designer 1 informs about internal resistance removal
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

5.
Label: introduce feature functoins

Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

15.
Label: sets boundaries

Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

17.
Label: providing context about the user's background
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

18.
Label: explain focus areas
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

19.
Label: user 4230 engages in participatory design
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

20.
Label: providing download link
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

23.
Label: commit to adding suggested feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

24.
Label: expressing enthusiasm non verbally
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

25.
Label: announces research
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

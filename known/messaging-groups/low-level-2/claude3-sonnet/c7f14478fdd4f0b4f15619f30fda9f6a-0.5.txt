Summary of the conversation until now: This conversation appears to be taking place within an online community interested in physics, astronomy, and related topics. Members share images, ask questions, provide explanations, and engage in casual discussions. The tone is generally friendly and inquisitive, with a mix of serious and lighthearted exchanges.
1. P2: I'm talking about the software.
2. P11: Then ask the group owner.
3. Designer: Mars is outside the Earth.
4. Designer: What's the problem?
5. P4: No problem.
6. P2: What about the moon?
7. P1: The moon is not drawn, right?
8. P14: Maybe it hasn't been done yet.
9. P14: 
10. Designer: Last time it was too rushed.
11. P4: The moon is useless.
12. P4: 2333
13. Designer: It depends on the scale.
14. P2: Who said that?
15. P4: universe sandbox
16. Designer: There will be multiple presets.
17. Designer: Because in reality, you encounter many possible questions, many of which are about near-Earth space stations.
18. P11: Yes.
19. Designer: Artificial satellite orbits.
20. Designer: These will involve more.
21. Designer: Binary star systems, although you probably won't encounter this normally...
22. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
23. P1: John, have you become more Android?
24. Designer: No, I'll update it today.
25. P17: [Image]
26. P2: Who knows how gravitational waves are measured?
27. Designer: I'll buy a ticket to space.
28. P17: It's the starry sky.
29. P1: Don't imitate it exactly the same.
30. P14: There are also software imitating celestial bodies on Steam.

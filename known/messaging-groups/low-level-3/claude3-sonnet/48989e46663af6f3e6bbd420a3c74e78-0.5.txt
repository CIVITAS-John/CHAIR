You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)

Thoughts: This conversation seems to be about understanding the meaning and norms around the "+1" expression used in the Physics Lab online community. To analyze it from multiple angles:

Learning sciences: How are community norms and practices being negotiated and learned through this interaction? What roles do more experienced members play in socializing newcomers?

Human-computer interaction: How does the conversational context and platform affordances shape the way meaning is constructed and norms are established? Are there cues or conventions specific to online text chat?

Participatory design: How are community members co-constructing the norms, language, and culture of their online space? What implicit or explicit design decisions enable or constrain this process?

Tags for each message:
1. agreement; minimal response; community norm
2. clarification-seeking; inquiring about norms; newcomer question  
3. explaining norms; clarifying meaning; experienced member guidance
4. defining norms; explaining meaning; redundant clarification
5. transition marker; conversational cue
6. referring to external resource; suggesting research; outsourcing explanation
7. acknowledgment; expressing gratitude 
8. agreement; adopting norm; implicit learning
9. unrelated comment; topic shift
10. acknowledgment; further investigation
11. minimal response; conversational closing

Summary: The conversation starts with P16 using the "+1" expression, which prompts P10 to ask for clarification on its meaning as a newcomer. P11 and P13 provide explanations that it signifies agreement or having the same opinion, establishing it as a community norm. P13 also suggests checking an external source (Baidu) for more information. P10 acknowledges understanding, while P2 demonstrates implicit learning by using "+1". The conversation then goes off on a tangent about payment requirements before wrapping up.

Notes: This interaction illustrates how community norms and practices around language/expressions get negotiated through Q&A exchanges between newcomers and more experienced members. More knowledgeable participants play a key role in socializing newcomers by explaining meanings and modeling norms. External resources may also be referenced to supplement community-based learning. The process involves both explicit negotiation as well as implicit adoption/reinforcement of norms through usage in context. Online conversational cues and platform affordances likely shape how this unfolds.

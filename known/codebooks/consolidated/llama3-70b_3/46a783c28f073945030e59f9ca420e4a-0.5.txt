You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: confirm feature implementation
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

2.
Label: designer 1 explains feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

3.
Label: inform about system limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

4.
Label: indicate future possibilities based on community needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

5.

14.
Label: engage user in development process
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

15.
Label: clarify compatibility expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

16.
Label: question
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

18.
Label: user 4232 highlights practicality
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

19.
Label: user feedback
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

20.
Label: advocate for better design practices
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

21.
Label: facilitated resource distribution
Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

22.
Label: express feature requests
Quotes:

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Summary: The conversation revolves around the release of Physics Lab version 1.0.1 and its distribution to the community. Designer-1 provides updates on the development process, including the app store submission and expected release timeline. Users show interest in downloading the software, with Designer-2 and Designer-1 providing information on distribution methods. Designer-1 also shares plans for upcoming features and solicits user feedback for future development. The conversation includes polite interactions and emoji responses, indicating a friendly and engaged community atmosphere.

Notes: 
1. The designers are actively fostering community engagement by providing regular updates and seeking user input.
2. There's a mix of formal (development updates) and informal (apologies for late-night messages) communication, which may help in building a more personal connection with users.
3. The use of a group file-sharing system suggests a closed or semi-closed community structure.
4. Designers are transparent about the development process and timeline, which may help build trust with users.
5. The solicitation of user feedback for future features indicates a participatory design approach.
6. The presence of teaching professionals in the community suggests that Physics Lab may be targeted towards educational use.
7. The use of emojis by users might indicate a comfortable and informal community atmosphere.
8. The designers seem responsive to user inquiries, providing prompt answers to questions.
9. The mention of cloud integration and local saving features suggests an emphasis on user data management and accessibility.
10. The conversation demonstrates a balance between designer-led development and user-influenced feature planning.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with P8 sharing an image, and the Designer responds by asking about uploading a high-definition version of the avatar. The conversation then shifts to the Designer asking if P4229 is a teacher, which is confirmed.

* Plan
This conversation can be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Questions to guide the analysis include: How do community members share and request resources? How do designers facilitate interactions and respond to user needs? What roles do community members take on, and how do they identify themselves?

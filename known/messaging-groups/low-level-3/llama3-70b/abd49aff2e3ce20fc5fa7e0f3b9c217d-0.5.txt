You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (10 in total):
1. {interpretation of message 1}; {another}; ...
...
10. {interpretation of message 10}; {another}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary codes: appreciation expression; community gratitude; acknowledgement of effort
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary codes: pc version inquiry; platform access; user needs
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary codes: file access; resource sharing; community support; sense of belonging
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary codes: update announcement; component modification; simulation improvement
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary codes: component explanation; ideal component introduction; educational content
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

Thoughts: For this initial round of coding, I'll focus on understanding the interactions between users and designers in the Physics Lab online community. I'll examine the language, tone, and content of each message to identify emerging themes related to community building, user needs, and design decisions. I'll consider how the designers respond to user inquiries and how users interact with each other and the designers. I'll also look for any power dynamics or social norms that may be emerging in the community.

Codes for each message:

1. appreciation expression; community gratitude; acknowledgement of effort
2. pc version inquiry; platform access; user needs
3. file access; resource sharing; community support; sense of belonging
4. image sharing; community engagement
5. update announcement; component modification; simulation improvement
6. component explanation; ideal component introduction; educational content
7. call for feedback; community engagement
8. pc version usage inquiry; user confusion
9. visual aid sharing; community support
10. system compatibility issue; technical limitation

Summary: The conversation begins with a user expressing gratitude towards the designers, followed by a user inquiring about accessing the PC version of Physics Lab. The designers respond with updates on component modifications and educational content. Users continue to ask questions about the PC version, and designers encourage feedback. The conversation also involves the sharing of resources and visual aids, highlighting a sense of community and support.

Notes: It appears that the community is forming around the Physics Lab platform, with users seeking access to resources and designers responding to their needs. The designers seem to be actively engaging with users, providing updates and explanations. I hypothesize that the community is driven by a sense of mutual support and a desire for knowledge sharing. I'll continue to explore these themes in subsequent coding rounds.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

20.
Label: context
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

21.
Label: clarification
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

22.

27.
Label: suggesting collaboration
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: enhancing user experience
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

2.
Label: encourage participatory design
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

3.
Label: access
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

6.
Label: allowing manual editing
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

7.
Label: suggesting features for mechanics and optics
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

8.
Label: offering immediate assistance
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

9.
Label: fostering friendly atmosphere
Quotes:

- Designer: Group sharing.

11.
Label: previewing future updates
Quotes:
- Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features

Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
More realistic 3D appearance for various meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeter and meter zeroing.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments
Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal/realistic modes.

# Special Tips
The Esc shortcut key will now minimize the window.
The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.

Label: announcing the removal of dry batteries as ideal components
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

13.
Label: explaining technical requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

14.
Label: expressing interest in cross platform access
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

15.
Label: advising incremental development
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

16.
Label: expressing concern for community members
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

17.
Label: design principles
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

18.
Label: the development process seems iterative
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

Label: providing specific design feedback
Quotes:
- User: Left side

20.
Label: considering diverse user environments
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

Label: direct communication
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

22.
Label: describing the old computer system at the user's school
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

23.
Label: gather context
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary codes: ** feature request**: user 4230 requests specific features; such as dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves and optical experiments; indicating their expectations from the community
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary codes: ** prioritization**: designer 1 outlines the development priorities; indicating a focus on completing the electrical section first
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary codes: ** feedback solicitation**: designer 1 expresses the need to gather opinions before starting mechanics; implying a willingness to incorporate user feedback
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary codes: ** appreciation**: user 4230 expresses gratitude for designer 1's hard work
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary codes: ** platform inquiry**: user 4231 asks about downloading the pc/interactive whiteboard version of physics lab; similar to user 4229's inquiry
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary codes: ** resource location**: user 4231 finds the group files; resolving their inquiry
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: 
In this conversation, I plan to explore how the online community of Physics Lab emerged. I will analyze the conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will examine how users and designers interact, share ideas, and collaborate to shape the development of Physics Lab. Guiding questions: How do users contribute to the development of Physics Lab? How do designers respond to user feedback and requests? What features and functionalities are prioritized in the development process?

Codes for each message:

1. **Feature request**: User 4230 requests specific features, such as dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves and optical experiments, indicating their expectations from the community.

2. **Prioritization**: Designer 1 outlines the development priorities, indicating a focus on completing the electrical section first.

3. **Feedback solicitation**: Designer 1 expresses the need to gather opinions before starting mechanics, implying a willingness to incorporate user feedback.

4. **Appreciation**: User 4230 expresses gratitude for Designer 1's hard work.

5. **Platform inquiry**: User 4231 asks about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab.

6. **Resource location**: User 4231 finds the group files, resolving their inquiry.

7. **Image sharing**: Designer 1 shares an image, potentially related to Physics Lab's development.

8. **Component update**: Designer 1 announces that dry batteries will no longer be ideal components in the next update, allowing users to simulate by removing internal resistance.

9. **Component introduction**: Designer 1 introduces the student power supply, an ideal component that supports both DC and AC.

Summary:
The conversation revolves around feature requests, prioritization, and feedback solicitation. Users request specific features, and Designer 1 responds by outlining development priorities and soliciting feedback. The conversation also touches on platform inquiries and resource location. Designer 1 shares updates on component changes and introduces new components, demonstrating their commitment to community engagement.

Notes:
It's interesting to see how users and designers interact in this online community. Designer 1 seems to be open to feedback and willing to incorporate user suggestions. The conversation highlights the importance of user feedback in shaping the development of Physics Lab. I hypothesize that this online community will continue to play a crucial role in the development process, with users and designers collaborating to create a comprehensive and engaging physics simulation platform.

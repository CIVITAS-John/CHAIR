You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
Preliminary phrases: requesting assistance with avatar upload; seeking to improve visual quality and personalization
3. User-4229: PC version?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about platform availability on pc; potentially indicating a preference for desktop use
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
Preliminary phrases: responding to user's inquiry; confirming intention to upload improved avatar; seeking to verify user's role
5. User-4229: Yes.
Preliminary phrases: confirming role as a teacher; potentially indicating an interest in using the platform for educational purposes
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.
7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

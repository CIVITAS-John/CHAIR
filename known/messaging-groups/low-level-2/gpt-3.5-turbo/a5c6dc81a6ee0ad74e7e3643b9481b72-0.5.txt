1. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
2. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.
3. Designer: Okay. Please give me more suggestions!
4. P4232: How to use the PC version?
5. P4232: [Image]
6. P8: It does not support the XP system.
7. P4232: Oh, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. P4232: Can it run on Win7?
9. P8: Win7 should work.
10. P4232: Thank you.
11. P8: You're welcome. If you encounter any problems during use, feel free to discuss them directly in the group.
12. P4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to do everything and ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer: I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to set up a virtual machine.
14. Designer: In theory, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from around 2008 onwards).
15. Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, with the following updates:

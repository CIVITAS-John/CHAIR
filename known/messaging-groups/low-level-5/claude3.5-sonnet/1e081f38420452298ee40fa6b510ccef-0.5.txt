You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Summary: The conversation revolves around the development and distribution of Physics Lab software. Designers are actively engaging with users, providing updates on development progress, and encouraging community participation. Users are showing interest in the software, seeking information about access, and responding positively to updates. The designers are fostering a collaborative atmosphere by soliciting feedback and being transparent about development plans. The conversation also reveals the multi-platform nature of the software (Windows and Apple versions mentioned) and the designers' efforts to manage user expectations regarding release timelines.

Notes: 
1. The designers appear to be using a community-centric approach to software development, actively involving users in the process.
2. There's a mix of formal and informal communication styles, which may help in creating a welcoming and accessible community atmosphere.
3. The presence of educators in the community (e.g., User-4232) suggests that Physics Lab may be targeting educational applications.
4. The use of emojis by users indicates a casual and friendly community environment.
5. The designers' responsiveness and transparency may be key factors in building trust and fostering community growth.
6. The mention of group files and sharing suggests the existence of a dedicated community platform or forum.
7. Further investigation into how user feedback is incorporated into the development process could provide insights into the participatory design aspects of Physics Lab.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Reason through the data comprehensively before start coding. When coding, also look at the interviewer's observations. Take note of emotions explicitly or implicitly expressed by the interviewee. Code through the lens of human-computer interaction and learning sciences.

Always follow the output format:

Thought: {What is the most common theme among the input quotes? Do not over-interpret the data.}
Phrase: {A single verb phrase that faithfully describes the topic}

Quotes:
- E01: You know, so in point of fact, I considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can. So that when I come back to it later, I could figure out why it, why it's not working anymore. (interviewer's observation) Discussion on code complexity & quality. Plain / not-tricky code's advantage in maintenance.
- E01: I mean, it's like, write a line of code. Are there any errors? But, beginners will start and they write three pages of code and then they hit the green check mark.  (interviewer's observation) Beginners could write chunks of code and then find many errors that they cannot fix.
- E04: It was really nice that it, like with the troubleshooting errors, for example, like at least in principle, I know that we had this one that we couldn't fix. It seemed like it was able to kind of do some better troubleshooting to a certain extent. (interviewer's observation) Better troubleshooting capability.
- E04: I think that it's nice that it's, it clarifies error codes. I think that's probably where people who are new get stuck the most is trying to figure out the syntax and all the different errors. (interviewer's observation) The capability to clarify the errors.

Thought: The most common theme among the input quotes is the handling and troubleshooting of errors in code, particularly for beginners. The interviewees emphasize the importance of clear and accessible code and appreciate the ability of LLM-driven interfaces to assist in troubleshooting and clarifying errors.

Phrase: Supporting error troubleshooting

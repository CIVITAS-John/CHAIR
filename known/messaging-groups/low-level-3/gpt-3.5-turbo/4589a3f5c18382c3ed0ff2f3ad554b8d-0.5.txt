You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

1. P4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary tags: user inquiry; politeness
2. P8: Shared in the group.
Preliminary tags: community sharing; group engagement
3. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
Preliminary tags: software download instructions; community resources
4. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and energized screwdriver this week. If there are any features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group. We will try our best to consider them. Saving experiments to the cloud/local storage, as mentioned before, is also in the plan. Thank you all!
Preliminary tags: participatory design; user feedback; feature planning; cloud storage; community collaboration
5. P4234: [Emoji 56]
Preliminary tags: emoji
6. P4232: [Emoji 57][Emoji 57]
Preliminary tags: non verbal communication; emoji use
7. P4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer: Hello :)
9. P4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer: [Image 61] Preparing for an update
11. Designer: This one is more complicated, so it will take a bit more time... Hopefully it will be ready for release this week
12. Designer: There will be: multimeter; energized solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem solving and middle school teaching)
13. P4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer: Have you encountered any problems while using it?
15. Designer: We try to design it to be usable without the need for additional instructions, or we will provide some tips when you open it for the first time based on feedback
16. P4235: Mainly for schools to build information technology schools
17. P4235: Need the user manual for this software
18. Designer: Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?
19. P4232: That's great, I hope it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no software that is convenient for drawing circuit diagrams for the circuit part of the exam
20. Designer: Actually, we are researching bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later
22. P4235: You can also include mechanics experiments
23. Designer: For example, after connecting the physical diagram, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics are sorted out; it will take some time
25. P4232: Oh, that's good
26. Designer: I hope to figure out electromagnetics before the end of the year
27. P4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do exercises in the application
29. P4234: It's starting to take shape [Emoji 80]
30. Designer: For example, connecting the physical diagram to see the circuit diagram, or vice versa
31. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer: Hmm.

Thoughts: In this conversation, we can explore the emergence of Physics Lab's online community by focusing on user engagement, participatory design, software features, community resources, and communication dynamics. We can analyze how users interact with the designer, the sharing of updates and feedback, the use of emojis and non-verbal communication, user inquiries, and the collaborative development of software features. Additionally, we can investigate the role of community members in shaping the software's direction and the ways in which the designer responds to user needs and suggestions.

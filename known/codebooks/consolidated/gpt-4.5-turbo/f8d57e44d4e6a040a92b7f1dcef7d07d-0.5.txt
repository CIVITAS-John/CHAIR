You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- **Can you identify more categories for merging?**
  Currently, with the provided categories, all possible merging has been executed. No additional categories are available for merging.

- **Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?**
  The merged category "community and technical dynamics" adequately covers both aspects of community engagement and technical problem solving without being too broad. There is no need for splitting as the new category remains specific and relevant to the research context.

- **Is any naming inaccurate?**
  The name "community and technical dynamics" effectively reflects the integration of community engagement (social, participatory aspects) with technical problem-solving (practical, operational aspects). It aligns well with the research themes of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

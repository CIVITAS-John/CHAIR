7. Designer-1: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
8. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
10. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
11. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
12. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
13. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.

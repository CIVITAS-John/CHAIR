You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* community dynamics
* community engagement
=> community aspects

* design and technical considerations
* human-computer interaction
=> technical considerations

* social dynamics
* social interaction
=> social aspects

# Reflection
Upon reviewing the categories, I noticed that:

* Categories 2 and 3 can be merged into a broader category, as they both relate to community aspects.
* Categories 4 and 5 can be merged, as they both relate to technical considerations.
* Categories 8 and 9 can be merged, as they both relate to social aspects.

However, I did not merge categories 1, 6, and 7, as they seem to be distinct and unrelated to the merged categories.

Some potential improvements:

* Categories 1, 6, and 7 could be further explored to identify potential subcategories or connections to other categories.
* The naming of the merged categories could be refined to better capture the essence of the combined codes.

# Final Merging
* community dynamics
* community engagement

* design and technical considerations
* human-computer interaction
=> technical considerations

* social dynamics
* social interaction
=> social aspects

* community building
=> community building (no change)

* knowledge construction

* knowledge sharing

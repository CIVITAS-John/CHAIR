You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

* Summary
In this conversation, Designer-1 is interacting with User-4229, a community member of Physics Lab's online platform. The discussion revolves around uploading a high-definition avatar, where Designer-1 inquires if User-4229 is a teacher, indicating a potential focus on educators within the community.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction, the conversation will be examined from three theoretical perspectives: learning sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and participatory design. Key considerations will include the role of interface design in facilitating user engagement (HCI), how the platform supports the identity and role of educators (learning sciences), and how user feedback is integrated into design decisions (participatory design). Questions guiding the analysis will include: How does the platform facilitate interaction between designers and users? What features support the educational identities of users? How are users involved in the design and refinement of platform features?

# Facilitating User Engagement
## Soliciting user input on features
Definition: Actions taken by designers to gather feedback or requirements directly from users to improve or tailor features based on their needs.
- "Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?"
- "Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?"
- "User-4229: Yes."

# Supporting Educational Identities
## Identifying user roles
Definition: Efforts by the platform's designers to understand and acknowledge the specific roles or professions of their users, which can influence how they interact with the platform and the features they prioritize.
- "Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?"
- "User-4229: Yes."
- "Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?"

# Participatory Design Practices
## Integrating user feedback into development
Definition: The process by which user suggestions, needs, and preferences are incorporated into the design and development of the platform, enhancing user satisfaction and platform usability.

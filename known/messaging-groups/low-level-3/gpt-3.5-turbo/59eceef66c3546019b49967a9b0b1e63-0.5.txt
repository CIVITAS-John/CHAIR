You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
9. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary tags: user feature request; educational content specificity
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary tags: feature prioritization; development planning
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: user feedback incorporation
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: user appreciation; community support
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary tags: information seeking; platform download
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary tags: user engagement; platform exploration
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: In analyzing these messages, consider the user's educational needs and requests, the designers' prioritization and planning processes, the incorporation of user feedback, community support and engagement, information seeking behavior, platform exploration, and updates in the features provided by Physics Lab.

Tags for each message:
1. educational content specificity; user feature request; physics demonstrations
2. feature prioritization; development planning; curriculum sequencing
3. user feedback incorporation; user-centered design
4. user appreciation; community support; positive reinforcement
5. information seeking; platform download; user support
6. user engagement; platform exploration; file utilization
7. visual communication; multimedia integration; design aesthetics
8. feature update; component simulation; circuit design
9. feature update; component functionality; electrical engineering

Summary: The conversation in the Physics Lab community includes user requests for specific educational content on mechanical waves and vibrations, optics, and electrical topics. The designers discuss prioritizing sections, gathering user opinions, and updating components in the upcoming releases. Users express appreciation, seek information on downloading the platform, and engage with existing features like group files.

Notes: The community shows a collaborative spirit with users making requests and designers considering user feedback. The platform seems to value user input in shaping its development roadmap. The conversation reflects a mix of user-driven content needs and designer-led feature updates, indicating a dynamic and participatory design process.

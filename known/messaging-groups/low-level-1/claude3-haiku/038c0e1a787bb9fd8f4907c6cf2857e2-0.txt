Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation revolves around the challenges and potential solutions for creating a comprehensive and free simulation tool for physics and chemistry experiments, with a focus on the context of high school education and exams. The participants discuss various technical aspects, such as the use of light-sensitive components and the potential incorporation of a fee or advertisements to support the development of the tool. The conversation also touches on social interactions within the group, with participants expressing caution, agreement, and acknowledgment.
1. P11: 23333
2. P11: I was just about to say.
3. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
4. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
5. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?
6. P14: It seems a bit troublesome.
7. P2: ……
8. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now.
9. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.
10. Designer: That's true.
11. Designer: Let's just click on ads, hh.
12. P14: Yes, that's fine.
13. P14: 
14. P2: What's wrong with middle schoolers [Emoji]
15. P2: A middle schooler is better than you.
16. P11: I just hope that ads won't take up too much space on the interface.
17. P11: Young man, you misunderstood.
18. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method.
19. P2: Oh.
20. P2: ～
21. Designer: The ads won't be permanent.
22. Designer: We just want you to click on ads to earn points, and then use the points to unlock new content.
23. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come and hit me along the network cable.
24. P2: I know how to code.
25. P11: Okay!
26. P2: [Emoji]
27. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is really annoying.
28. P2: Indeed
29. Designer: The screen isn't big and it's still got psoriasis.
30. P2: It even forces you to click.

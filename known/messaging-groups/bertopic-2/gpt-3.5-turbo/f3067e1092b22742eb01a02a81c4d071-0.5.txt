You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Create multiple interpretations for both the interviewee's verbal response and the interviewer's observations. Take note of emotions explicitly or implicitly expressed by the interviewee. Code through the lens of human-computer interaction and learning sciences.

Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- E01: And I find what I have trouble with and certainly what beginners have trouble with is "scope".   You know, when you go from one point to another and all of a sudden you're, you're not no longer in ask turtles to do something you're in, ask links to do. But you know, so all of a sudden you've shifted, you've shifted your variable space and this happens implicitly and all of a sudden you're writing code and then it gives you an error that of the nature X Y Z doesn't operate in a turtle context. (interviewer's observation) AI needs to support learning of the "scope" concept in NetLogo.
- E01: So let's say "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square." (interviewer's observation) E01's first task.
- E01: "I would like to write code to have a turtle run slowly around the perimeter of a square, but the square should go larger each time it goes around." (interviewer's observation) Seeing AI's counter question, E01 makes his request more detailed.
- E01: So set up, move the turtle to go. Increase the size of the turtle by two units. Oh, dear. It's, it's making the turtle bigger. Oh, that's kind of, that's kind of messed it up a little bit then. (interviewer's observation) E01 reads the code and comments, summarizing the code, and thinks about how the AI was understanding the request.

Thought: Challenges in understanding and implementing code in NetLogo, specifically related to the concept of "scope".
Phrase: Struggling with code scope
===

Interpretation 1:
Interviewee's verbal response: E01 expresses frustration and confusion when discussing the concept of "scope" in NetLogo, highlighting the difficulty beginners face when transitioning between different contexts for coding tasks.
Interviewer's observations: The interviewer notes that E01 struggles to grasp the concept of "scope" and experiences errors due to shifting variable spaces while writing code in NetLogo.

Interpretation 2:
Interviewee's verbal response: E01 articulates the challenge of maintaining variable scope in NetLogo coding, emphasizing the implicit nature of transitioning between different turtle contexts.
Interviewer's observations: The interviewer observes E01's struggle with understanding and applying the concept of "scope" in NetLogo, leading to errors related to variable contexts and turtle operations.

Interpretation 3:
Interviewee's verbal response: E01 discusses the issue of scope in NetLogo coding, mentioning the complexity of shifting variable spaces and the resulting errors in code execution.
Interviewer's observations: The interviewer notices E01's difficulty in handling scope-related challenges in NetLogo, particularly when transitioning between turtle contexts and encountering errors due to variable scope issues.

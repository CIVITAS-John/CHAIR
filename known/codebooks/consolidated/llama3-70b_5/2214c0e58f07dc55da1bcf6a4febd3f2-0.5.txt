You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (8 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

Label: no need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

3.
Label: demonstrating subject knowledge
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

4.
Label: sharing teaching background
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

5.
Label: welcome
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

6.
Label: seeking suggestions
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

7.
Label: expanding on user suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

8.
Label: announcement of plans
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

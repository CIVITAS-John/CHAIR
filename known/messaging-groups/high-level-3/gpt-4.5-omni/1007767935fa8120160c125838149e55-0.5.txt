You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

* Summary
The interaction primarily involves a discussion between a designer and users about the development of a Physics Lab's online community, focusing on the creation and improvement of simulated experiment assessments for electricity and the design of circuit diagrams. The designer actively consults users, especially teachers, to ensure the features align with current educational standards and user preferences. The conversation also touches on the logistics of upcoming updates and releases across different platforms.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we can explore themes such as collaborative design, user feedback integration, and iterative development processes. We will look into how the designer engages with users to gather insights and make design decisions, the types of feedback provided by users, and how this feedback is incorporated into the development process. Guiding questions include: How does the participatory design process unfold in this interaction? What are the key factors that contribute to effective user-designer communication? How does the iterative development process reflect principles of human-computer interaction and learning sciences?

# Collaborative Design
## Consult users
Definition: Actively seeking input and feedback from users to guide the design process.
- "When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group"
- "Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?"
- "So, use both?"

## Incorporate feedback
Definition: Adjusting design elements based on user suggestions and feedback.
- "Uh... left side or right side"
- "Left side"
- "But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing"

## Acknowledge user contributions
Definition: Recognizing and appreciating the input and support from users.
- "Thank you all for your support. We will do better!"
- "This idea is really good"
- "Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]"

# Iterative Development
## Plan updates
Definition: Scheduling and communicating upcoming changes and releases to the community.

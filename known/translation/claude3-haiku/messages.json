        "Tolerance is a virtue; tolerance is a realm; tolerance brings two hearts closer; tolerance fuses the two poles of the earth. Tolerance is like a blooming flower, fragrant throughout the spring; tolerance is like a lush tree, cooling the whole summer; tolerance is like a fiery maple, igniting the entire autumn; tolerance is like a shocking snow, silencing the whole winter. Those who have tolerance are like having an ocean, accommodating countless rivers; those who have tolerance are like having a sky, containing countless birds; those who have tolerance are like having a vast desert, embracing countless grains of sand. Tolerance is something everyone needs to possess, tolerance is a gentleman's magnanimity, a gentleman's generosity. In the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu staged the story of \"Three Angers\". They agreed that whoever conquered Nanjiang first, Nanjiang would belong to him. As a result, Zhuge Liang took advantage of Zhou Yu's painstaking thinking about how to attack the city and captured Nanjiang without his knowledge, which was the first anger. The second anger was the famous: Zhou Yu's clever plan to pacify the world, losing his wife and troops. He wanted to use the beauty strategy to keep Liu Bei, but was discovered by Zhuge Liang, who used a strategy to bring Liu Bei and his wife back. The third anger was because Zhou Yu used the \"borrowing the way to destroy Guo\" strategy. He wanted to take Jingzhou, but pretended to first take Hanzhong, wanting to take the opportunity to capture Liu Bei, but was eventually discovered by Zhuge Liang. In the end, because his strategies were repeatedly seen through by Zhuge Liang, he fell seriously ill and died soon after, crying to the sky before his death: \"Since Zhuge Liang was born, why was I born?\" Zhou Yu was finally killed by his anger. He was proficient in both literature and martial arts, but he lacked a kind of magnanimity, a kind of generosity. In this world, since we can't find two identical leaves, there are even less two identical people. Each person has their own personality, pursuit, habit, and specialty, each person has their own way of living, dealing with things, and thinking habits. Therefore, it is normal for some differences to arise between people. As long as we have a tolerant heart, empathize, respect, and understand others, we can gain a kind of happiness, a kind of enjoyment, a kind of contentment. Tolerance is a high mountain, able to accommodate both flowers and thorns; able to accommodate towering trees and a slender little grass; tolerance is a gentle spring rain, able to melt the solid ice layer and awaken the dormant love; tolerance is a whistling autumn wind, able to disperse the clouds of inferiority and recall the lost conscience. Tolerance is cultivation, understanding, and caring; tolerance is giving, dedication, a crescent moon, a colorful sunset."

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: realizes need for reset, identifies the need for setup reset
- Recognizes the need for resetting certain parameters.
- Identifies the need for a reset in the setup based on AI-generated code, recognizes the need for model reset, and realizes the need to reset their setup.

2.
Concepts: evaluating ai-generated code
- Participants compare and evaluate AI-generated code to human-generated code.
- Participants critically evaluate AI output, identifying potential issues or limitations.
- The participant comments on code output, summarizing and evaluating AI-generated code to understand AI's understanding of requests.

3.
Concepts: assesses ai accuracy
- Participants assess and evaluate AI's search accuracy and response accuracy.
- Participants evaluate AI responses, deciding whether to use specific extensions.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: realizes need for reset, identifies the need for setup reset
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as realizing the need for reset leads to identifying the need for setup reset.
Criteria: Participants recognize and identify the need to reset certain parameters or their setup based on AI-generated code.
Phrase: Recognizes the need for reset.

2.
Concepts: evaluating ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected, as evaluating AI-generated code involves comparing, criticizing, and summarizing the code.
Criteria: Participants compare, evaluate, and comment on AI-generated code to understand its limitations and potential issues.
Phrase: Evaluates AI-generated code.

3.
Concepts: assesses ai accuracy
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as assessing AI's search accuracy and response accuracy are both aspects of evaluating AI's overall accuracy.
Criteria: Participants evaluate the accuracy of AI responses and search results to determine their reliability.
Phrase: Assesses AI accuracy.

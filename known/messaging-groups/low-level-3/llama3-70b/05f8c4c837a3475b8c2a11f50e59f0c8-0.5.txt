Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Thoughts: 
For this conversation, I plan to analyze the emergence of the online community through the lens of social cohesion, community norms, and social learning. I'll examine how the participants interact with each other, particularly in their use of "+1" and its meaning. I'll also explore how the designer's intention behind the community's design influences the participants' behavior and interactions. Guiding questions include: How do participants use humor and self-deprecation to build relationships? How do they negotiate meaning and establish community norms? 

Tags for each message:
1. exception; self deprecation; community humor
2. agreement; community alignment; social cohesion; validation
3. agreement; community alignment; social cohesion; validation
4. agreement; community alignment; social cohesion; validation
5. question; community norms; social learning; inquiry
6. explanation; community understanding; social bonding; empathy
7. definition; community knowledge; social learning
8. hesitation; uncertainty; self-expression
9. suggestion; resource provision; community support

Summary: 
This conversation revolves around the meaning of "+1" and its significance in the online community. Participants use "+1" to express agreement and alignment, fostering a sense of social cohesion. The conversation also touches on community norms, with participants inquiring about and explaining the meaning of "+1". The tone is lighthearted, with instances of self-deprecation and humor.

Notes: 
It appears that the community is still in the process of establishing its norms and language. The use of "+1" is a significant aspect of this, as it serves as a way to build consensus and create a sense of community. The designer's influence on the community's design may have contributed to this phenomenon. I hypothesize that as the community continues to evolve, its language and norms will become more refined.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

~~~
1. feedback integration, user feedback and software usability.
- Discussions that highlight the designer's efforts to incorporate user feedback and improve the educational value and functionality of the Physics Lab software.
- Discussions where users provide feedback, suggestions, or comments about the Physics Lab software, as well as discussions related to the usability and user experience of the Physics Lab software.

2. feedback and iteration, iterative design.
- The exchange of feedback between users and the designer, and the designer's responsiveness to that feedback.
- The process of continuously refining the software based on user feedback and testing, and the designer's efforts to incorporate the community's input and ideas into the software's development.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1. Feedback Integration
Relationship: The first input covers two related concepts - user feedback and software usability. These are parallel concepts that can be combined under a broader label.
Criteria: Discussions that highlight the designer's efforts to incorporate user feedback and improve the educational value and functionality of the Physics Lab software, as well as discussions where users provide feedback, suggestions, or comments about the Physics Lab software, and discussions related to the usability and user experience of the Physics Lab software.
Label: Feedback Integration
Category: Participatory Design

2. Iterative Design
Relationship: The second input covers two related concepts - feedback and iteration, and iterative design. These are parallel concepts that can be combined under a broader label.
Criteria: The exchange of feedback between users and the designer, and the designer's responsiveness to that feedback. The process of continuously refining the software based on user feedback and testing, and the designer's efforts to incorporate the community's input and ideas into the software's development.
Label: Iterative Design

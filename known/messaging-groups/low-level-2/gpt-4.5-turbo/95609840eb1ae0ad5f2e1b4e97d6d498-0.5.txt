Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation reveals a dynamic and interactive community focused on the development and refinement of educational software. Members of the community engage in various forms of social interaction, including asking questions, sharing updates, providing technical support, and expressing feedback and suggestions. The interactions are collaborative and supportive, aiming to enhance the software's effectiveness in educational settings.
1. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
2. Designer: Hmm.
3. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
4. P4232: Indeed
5. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
6. Designer: I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
7. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
8. P4232: This is a really good idea
9. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
10. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

11. Designer: [Image]This one.
12. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.

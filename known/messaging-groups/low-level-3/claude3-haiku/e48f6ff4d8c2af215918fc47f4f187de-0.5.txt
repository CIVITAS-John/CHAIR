You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Thoughts: This conversation appears to be about the emergence of an online community around the Physics Lab project. The initial message from P14 suggests some level of exclusion or self-deprecation, which is then met with agreement and engagement from other participants (P13, P15, P16). The subsequent questions and explanations about the meaning of "+1" indicate a shared understanding and participation in the community's norms and practices. To fully analyze this, I will need to consider perspectives from learning sciences (e.g., social learning, community of practice), human-computer interaction (e.g., user engagement, interface design), and participatory design (e.g., user involvement, co-creation).

Summary: This conversation demonstrates the emergence of an online community around the Physics Lab project. The initial message from P14 suggests some level of exclusion or self-deprecation, which is then met with agreement and engagement from other participants (P13, P15, P16). The subsequent questions and explanations about the meaning of "+1" indicate a shared understanding and participation in the community's norms and practices. The participants are actively engaging with each other, seeking clarification, and referencing external resources to build a shared understanding within the community.

Notes: The conversation suggests that the online community around Physics Lab is in the early stages of formation, with participants establishing shared practices and norms. The self-deprecation from P14 and the need for clarification on the meaning of "+1" indicate that not all members may feel fully included or integrated into the community yet. However, the overall engagement and agreement among the participants suggest a growing sense of community. Further analysis from learning sciences, HCI, and participatory design perspectives could provide insights into how this community is developing and how the designer can foster more inclusive and collaborative participation.

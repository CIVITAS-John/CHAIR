You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Here is a codebook for analyzing the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with Designer-2 sharing an image, followed by Designer-1 asking how to upload a high-definition avatar. User-4229 asks about a PC version, and Designer-1 responds, asking if User-4229 is a teacher.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do designers and users interact in this online community? What are the initial topics of discussion, and how do they relate to the emergence of the community?

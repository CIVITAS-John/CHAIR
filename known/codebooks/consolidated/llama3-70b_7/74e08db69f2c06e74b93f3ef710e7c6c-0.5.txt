You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: development update
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

2.
Label: maintain community interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

3.
Label: indirect reject
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

4.
Label: designer 1 provides development update
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

5.
Label: requested information on encountered problems
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

6.
Label: second the previous response
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

7.
Label: invite user participation
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

8.
Label: developer respnse
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

9.
Label: highlight long term benefits
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

10.
Label: engage in troubleshooting

17.
Label: reiterate need for user manual
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

18.
Label: express gratitude
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
- User: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.
- User: Thank you.

19.
Label: user 4232 considers touch screen usability

- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

24.
Label: seek clarification
Quotes:
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?
- User: PC version?
- User: Excuse me.

25.
Label: express amusement
Quotes:
- Designer: ðŸ˜‚

26.
Label: provide feedback
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

27.
Label: reach a conclusion for the solution based on user's response
Quotes:

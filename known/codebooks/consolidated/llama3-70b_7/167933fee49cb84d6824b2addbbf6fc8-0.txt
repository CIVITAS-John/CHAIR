1.
Label: great insight on relationship between human & ai
Quotes:
- E01: I think the key is to not replace human judgment and ability, but to find a fast way to increase human capability and judgment. (interviewer's observation) Augmentation of human capabilities & building on human judgement. Subjectivity of humanity?

2.
Label: limitations (large dataset)
Quotes:
- E01: It's about, let's see, what did I count is 3800 lines of code. Well, first I couldn't feed it all the ChatGPT can only take it 1800 lines at a time. And then I said, you know, can you tell me what this does? And it basically said, no. ... I can live with that again. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT's limitation on reading long code pieces.

3.
Label: time investment
Quotes:
- E01: The problem I posted was about 100 pages of NetLogo and then 100 pages, 100 lines of NetLogo. And it was a real problem that I had looked at. I would love to help this person, but this is going to take me minimum of two hours to figure out what are they trying to do? (interviewer's observation) Although AI made mistake, E01 still believes in the value in having an AI-generated solution (compared with no solution or no help).

4.
Label: task switch
Quotes:
- E04: So that's interesting anyways, I'm going back to Perceptron. (interviewer's observation) E04 gives up immediately after the AI asks the same question again.
- E04: "Draw a smiley face" / "Drawing on the canvas" (interviewer's observation) E04 switches to a simpler task.

5.
Label: code generation
Quotes:
- E01: I want to do this in visual basic... So I made a spreadsheet and I asked ChatGPT, how do you do this? And it wrote the code and the code worked out of the box. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT helped with a VBA task out of the box before.

6.
Label: expresses satisfaction
Quotes:
- E01: I want to do this in visual basic... So I made a spreadsheet and I asked ChatGPT, how do you do this? And it wrote the code and the code worked out of the box. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT helped with a VBA task out of the box before.
- E01: And then very often, it could.  (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could often resolve errors by itself.

7.
Label: decides to change approach
Quotes:
- E04: So that's interesting anyways, I'm going back to Perceptron. (interviewer's observation) E04 gives up immediately after the AI asks the same question again.

8.
Label: beginner practices
Quotes:
- E01: I mean, it's like, write a line of code. Are there any errors? But, beginners will start and they write three pages of code and then they hit the green check mark.  (interviewer's observation) Beginners could write chunks of code and then find many errors that they cannot fix.

9.
Label: finds interface helpful
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

10.
Label: emphasizes need for expertise
Quotes:
- E04: To me, it seems like you need to have a certain degree of expertise to understand where the errors are and how to fix them. Because otherwise it's like you're going down this path where you're blindly following the ChatGPT and you have no idea what's going on. For less experienced people, I wouldn't like that because it could put you in a worse situation. (interviewer's observation) Requires expertise to understand errors and debug them. Risks to blindly follow ChatGPT, esp. for less experienced people.

11.
Label: prefers non linear learning
Quotes:
- E01: I cannot learn like that. I'm sorry. I am not a top left first page to last page. So if AI can help find a good place to start and manage that learning process, then I think that's astounding. (interviewer's observation) Critique on the existing situation of technical documentation and imagine that AI could improve the learning process.

12.
Label: expressing frustration with error resolution options
Quotes:
- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.
- E04: So, I guess that's kind of annoying because I didn't really want it to explain here, but that was the only option that I had. (interviewer's observation) E04 wants the "fix" option right after the errors are identified.

13.
Label: reacts to ai error
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 laughs when he sees ChatGPT making a classical error.

14.
Label: peer-programming vs. do your own work
Quotes:
- E01: I'm an advocate of peer programming. It's about 10 times more efficient than single programming... If a person's programming, if you're programming it by yourself and you come to something you don't understand, you could spend a long time at that stoplight. (interviewer's observation) E01's positive opinions on peer programming with a hint that AI could play the role.

15.
Label: common errors
Quotes:
- E01: And I find what I have trouble with and certainly what beginners have trouble with is "scope".   You know, when you go from one point to another and all of a sudden you're, you're not no longer in ask turtles to do something you're in, ask links to do. But you know, so all of a sudden you've shifted, you've shifted your variable space and this happens implicitly and all of a sudden you're writing code and then it gives you an error that of the nature X Y Z doesn't operate in a turtle context. (interviewer's observation) AI needs to support learning of the "scope" concept in NetLogo.

16.
Label: model retrieval
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a neural network" - I want to see if it actually pulls up the model. (interviewer's observation) E04 experiments with the AI to see what phrases could give a correct search result.

18.
Label: advises using personal judgment
Quotes:
- E01: Some of this advice may be wrong. Use your good judgment. This is like Apple maps in 2010 or whatever, that tells you to turn right into the river and you have to go. (interviewer's observation) Users need to use their own judgment to evaluate ChatGPT's responses.

19.
Label: help-seeking
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.
- E01: if you approach the user group politely, graciously, and instead of dropping your entire code on it, you go, I narrowed it down to this. I read this documentation. I tried these eight things with this answer and I'm perplexed. If somebody goes, they paste their problem and it's clearly their homework and they want someone else to do it for them. No, I'm not going to help with that. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on proper practices to seek online help: do your own work and clearly describe what you need/tried.
- E01: Part of getting AI to be your assistant on the side is, is having a culture where you're used to asking for help. And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.
- E01: I had a problem and I couldn't figure out how to solve this problem. I finally got online and I discovered there was this user group that would help you for free with problems. And it was stunning. (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on seeking help online.
- E01: "can you verify that no more names are reserved words in NetLogo?" I don't know if it can do that. (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug after the third iteration, he asks ChatGPT to verify the code and produce no more bug. Unsure if it could do that.

20.
Label: knowledge gaps
Quotes:
- E01: So my observation is that a critical, critical 10%, maybe more, maybe a lot more of knowledge that you need to do your job in software is only contained in oral tradition. It's, it is not documented anywhere.  (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on knowledge in pieces - how they are generated and sustained.

21.
Label: highlights common beginner mistakes
Quotes:
- E01: And I find what I have trouble with and certainly what beginners have trouble with is "scope".   You know, when you go from one point to another and all of a sudden you're, you're not no longer in ask turtles to do something you're in, ask links to do. But you know, so all of a sudden you've shifted, you've shifted your variable space and this happens implicitly and all of a sudden you're writing code and then it gives you an error that of the nature X Y Z doesn't operate in a turtle context. (interviewer's observation) AI needs to support learning of the "scope" concept in NetLogo.

23.
Label: agent based models
Quotes:
- E04: I use it a lot for developing like, equations for specific like, aspects of agent-based models that I create. (interviewer's observation) Helpful for creating equations

24.
Label: avoids direct code copying
Quotes:
- E04: (Throughout this phase. He uses generated code only for reference when writing his own.) (interviewer's observation) E04 writes code manually with the steps given by ChatGPT, rather than copy & paste code.

25.
Label: prefers immediate fixes
Quotes:
- E04: So, I guess that's kind of annoying because I didn't really want it to explain here, but that was the only option that I had. (interviewer's observation) E04 wants the "fix" option right after the errors are identified.

And asking that early and often, and you know, from development costs, the later you discover you have a problem, the more it costs to fix it. (interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

28.
Label: collaboration
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

29.
Label: suggests need for efficient learning tools
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the, one of the things which I have observed, as I'm bouncing from like, because I do a lot of different languages and potentially, so I don't have that much time to spend in anyone. (interviewer's observation) As an expert, E01 knows many languages but does not have much time for each one.

30.
Label: selective code usage
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) Again, he reads the code and selectively copies code to the model.

31.
Label: system usability
Quotes:
- E04: It seems like it's, you know, pretty straightforward to use and like intuitive, which is nice. And it's like, it's easy to interact with. So I feel like if I had like enough time to play around with it, it could be like really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Straightforward to use and intuitive.

32.
Label: reduce human effort
Quotes:
- E01: I cannot learn like that. I'm sorry. I am not a top left first page to last page. So if AI can help find a good place to start and manage that learning process, then I think that's astounding. (interviewer's observation) Critique on the existing situation of technical documentation and imagine that AI could improve the learning process.

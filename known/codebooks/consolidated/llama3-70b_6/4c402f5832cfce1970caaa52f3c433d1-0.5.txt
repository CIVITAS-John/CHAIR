You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: revealing user needs, clarifying design preferences and seeking input
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as users reveal their needs and designers clarify design preferences to seek input, which is a cyclical process.
Criteria: Designers ask users about their needs and preferences, and users provide explanations, leading to designers seeking input on design choices.
Phrase: Seeking user input on design preferences.

2.
Concepts: considers user feedback, commits to user-driven design
Relationship: The concepts are causally related, as considering user feedback leads to a commitment to incorporating it into the design.
Criteria: Designers take user suggestions into account and demonstrate a commitment to designing based on user needs.
Phrase: Committing to user-driven design.

3.
Concepts: explain context, provides real world context
Relationship: The concepts are synonymous, as explaining context and providing real-world context are two sides of the same coin.

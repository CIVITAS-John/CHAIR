You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: user profiling, user roles and user profiling
- Users or designers confirm or acknowledge a user's profession or role, such as a teacher.
- Identifying or mentioning the roles or backgrounds of users, which may influence their needs or perspectives, users discuss or inquire about user profiling, demographics, roles, or characteristics.

2.
Concepts: image sharing, reflecting on experiences and sharing classroom stories
- Sharing or posting of images related to the Physics Lab online community.
- Sharing personal experiences or anecdotes related to the Physics Lab's online community, or sharing experiences or stories about using the Physics Lab's online community in a classroom setting.

3.
Concepts: supportive interactions
- User or designer expresses a tone or attitude that is encouraging or supportive.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: user profiling, user roles and user profiling
Relationship: Inclusion (user profiling is a part of understanding user roles)
Criteria: Users or designers mention or discuss user demographics, roles, or characteristics that influence their needs or perspectives.
Label: User Characterization

2.
Concepts: image sharing, reflecting on experiences and sharing classroom stories
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts relate to sharing experiences, but in different forms)
Criteria: Users share images or personal anecdotes related to their experiences with the Physics Lab's online community.
Label: Community Storytelling

3.
Concepts: supportive interactions
Relationship: Intersection (both concepts involve a supportive tone or attitude)
Criteria: Users or designers engage with each other in a supportive or encouraging manner, such as through greetings or words of encouragement.
Label: Community Building

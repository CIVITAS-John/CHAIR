You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: inquiring about capabilities, questioning ai capabilities
- User inquires about AI's capabilities or limitations.
- Participants question AI capabilities, seeking clarification on its limitations, and express uncertainty or doubt about AI's capabilities.

2.
Concepts: noting code limitations, current limitations
- Participants note that AI-generated code can be incomplete or contain errors and lack external verification.
- The participant identifies limitations in the current AI implementation, such as the inability to check generated code with external information.

3.
Concepts: using ai for coding assistance, optimizing code with ai
- Participants use AI-driven interfaces for coding assistance, such as optimizing code or identifying errors.
- Participants seek to optimize code with AI assistance and use AI to improve their workflow, seeking feedback and suggestions for code optimization.

4.
Concepts: evaluating ai-generated code
- Participants read and evaluate AI-generated code, conducting a detailed evaluation of its quality and relevance to their task.
- Participants identify errors or inaccuracies in AI-generated code, interpret and correct AI-generated code, and evaluate and interpret AI-generated code.

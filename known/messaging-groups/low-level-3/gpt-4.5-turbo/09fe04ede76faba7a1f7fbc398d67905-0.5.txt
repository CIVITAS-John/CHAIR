You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: Analyzing these messages, it is essential to consider the dynamics of community formation and interaction within Physics Lab's online platform. The use of "+1" as a recurring signal of agreement and solidarity among members could be indicative of participatory design elements that encourage peer support and shared understanding. This analysis could benefit from exploring how these interactions contribute to a sense of community and collective learning. Additionally, the inquiry about the meaning of "+1" and the responses it elicited highlight aspects of knowledge sharing and community support, which are crucial in learning sciences and human-computer interaction. How do these interactions facilitate user engagement and inclusivity in the community? What role does the design of the platform play in fostering these interactions?

Tags for each message:
1. self-awareness; exclusion feeling; community dynamics
2. consensus building; community cohesion; user interaction
3. repeated agreement; community participation; social engagement
4. community agreement; reinforcement of norms; social interaction
5. community language inquiry; engagement through questioning; clarification request
6. informative response; solidarity expression; peer education
7. agreement definition; community vocabulary; peer explanation
8. hesitation expression; non-verbal communication; thought process
9. external resource suggestion; directing to information; self-service encouragement

Summary: The conversation involves several participants interacting around the use of the term "+1" within the Physics Lab community. Participant 10's question about the meaning of "+1" triggers responses from others, explaining its use as a form of agreement or shared opinion. This sequence of messages highlights an aspect of community engagement and the sharing of norms among members. The responses to the inquiry not only clarify the term but also reinforce the community’s normative behaviors and participatory engagement. The use of "+1" serves as a social glue, fostering solidarity and quick consensus building among members.

Notes: The use of "+1" might be seen as a microcosm of community interaction and norm setting within Physics Lab. It is interesting to note how quickly other members come to aid when a question about community norms is raised, which suggests a strong sense of collective identity and support. This could be further explored to understand how digital platforms can enhance learning and participation through simple interactive features. Additionally, the response directing to an external resource (Baidu) indicates a level of self-directed learning encouraged within the community. This aspect could be crucial in understanding the participatory design elements of the platform.

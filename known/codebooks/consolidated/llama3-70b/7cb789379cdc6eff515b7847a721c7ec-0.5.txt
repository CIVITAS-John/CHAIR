You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes.
Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

4.
Label: explain reasons for the request
Quotes:
- This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

5.
Label: respond to the feature request
Quotes:
- Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

6.

Quotes:
- Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

7.
Label: promise to make the feature on a later time
Quotes:
- Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

8.
Label: give an example of the feature's functions
Quotes:
- For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

9.

14.
Label: compliment on the app's evolvment
Quotes:
- It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]

15.
Label: give a suggestion about taking the development slow
Quotes:
- Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

16.
Label: explain intention of the app design
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

17.
Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- I myself have some interest in chemistry

18.
Label: promise to development an app about chemistry on a later time
Quotes:
- We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

19.
Label: give examples of feature
Quotes:

20.
Label: promise to invite feedback from everyone in the group
Quotes:
- When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

21.
Label: ask about user needs
Quotes:
- Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

23.
Label: second the previous response
Quotes:
- Yes, the common one is still the old style

24.
Label: give further information about the convesation
Quotes:
- But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing

25.
Label: make a suggestion
Quotes:
- So, use both?

26.
Label: explain current version's limitation
Quotes:
- This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

27.

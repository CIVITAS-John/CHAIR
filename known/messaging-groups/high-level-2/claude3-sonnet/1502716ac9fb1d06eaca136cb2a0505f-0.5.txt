Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

* Summary
This conversation seems to be about a group working on some kind of electronics or physics experiment. They are discussing how to connect components, make the device work, and display data. There are several images shared showing wiring and components. One participant asks about adding a wave, which could suggest they are working with wave signals or oscilloscopes. There is also a question in Chinese about how to make "it" work.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we could look for evidence of:

1. Collaborative learning processes (e.g. knowledge sharing, co-construction)
2. User experience factors (e.g. usability issues, interface design feedback) 
3. Participatory design dynamics (e.g. roles, decision making, negotiation)
4. Socio-technical factors (e.g. use of tools, representations)

We can code the data for instances of these factors and analyze how they contributed to the emergence of the online community.

# Collaborative Learning  
## Knowledge Sharing
Definition: Instances where participants share information, instructions or explanations
- "The wiring is all on top"
- "Just press the button with the wire" 
- "How to make it work"

## Co-construction  
Definition: Instances where participants build understanding together through dialog
- "Why suddenly add a wave?"
- "How to display the data"
- "How to connect"

# User Experience
## Usability Issues  
Definition: Comments indicating problems or difficulties with using the system
- "Let him" (suggesting a usability issue)
- "That key" (referring to a control or interface element)

## Design Feedback
Definition: Suggestions or critiques related to the design of the system
- (No clear examples)

# Participatory Design
## Roles
Definition: Indicators of different roles or responsibilities in the group
- "Designer: Play by conducting experiments" (Designer role)

## Decision Making  
Definition: Instances of negotiating decisions or next steps
- (No clear examples)

# Socio-technical Factors
## Tool Use
Definition: Discussing or working with physical or digital tools
- (Images showing wiring, components, suggesting use of electronics tools)

## Representations
Definition: Use of representations like visuals, symbols, models etc.
- (Several images shared, which seem to represent wiring setups or components)

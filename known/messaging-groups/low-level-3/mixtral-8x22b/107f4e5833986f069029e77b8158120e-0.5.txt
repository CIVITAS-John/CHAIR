You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation revolves around the designers sharing updates and upcoming features for Physics Lab, such as the multimeter, powered solenoid, and semiconductor capacitor. Users provide feedback and request features like a user manual, easy circuit diagram drawing, and mechanics experiments. The designers express a desire to create an intuitive design and incorporate bidirectional conversion between physical and circuit diagrams. They also discuss the potential inclusion of mechanics experiments and the need to refine features one by one.
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

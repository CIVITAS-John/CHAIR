Summary of the conversation until now: The conversation demonstrates the emergence of an online community within the Physics Lab, where members engage in various discussions, share information, and interact with each other. The community exhibits characteristics such as responsiveness, clarification, agreement, and a sense of shared interest in physics-related topics. The use of images and analogies further enhances the communication and understanding within the group.
1. P14: I can't remember if it's 78 or 79.
2. P14: [Image]
3. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
4. P11: Look it up online, this is not something that can be solved in a few words. @P2 
5. P2: Can we add a motor? @Designer 
6. P14: I think I should focus on doing mathematics.
7. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
8. Designer: We will be relatively simple, practical (close to the exam), and affordable.
9. P11: 2333
10. P11: Ask the group owner.
11. Designer: After all, it's not specifically about astronomy.
12. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
13. P2: [Image]
14. P2: From what I know currently.
15. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in the Physics Lab?
16. Designer: Motor simulation is more complicated, and it depends on the load.
17. Designer: Calculated it...
18. P2: How was it calculated?
19. P11: Okay.
20. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
21. P11: [Image]
22. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but an atomized model.
23. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
24. P1: Server?
25. P11: Hahaha
26. Designer: Standalone.
27. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
28. Designer: Two types of motors.
29. P1: Are you going to the server?
30. P2: Brushed motor.

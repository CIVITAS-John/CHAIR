You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: wonders about compatibility
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

2.
Label: influences design decisions
Quotes:
- User: Left side

3.
Label: suggest practical use case
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

4.
Label: promoting community involvement in development
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

5.
Label: considering simplification in design
Quotes:
- Designer: Make it simpler...

6.
Label: soliciting specific needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

7.
Label: request specific features
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

8.
Label: informing users of changes
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

9.

Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

10.
Label: advise on development approach
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

11.
Label: seeks clarification on the preferred side for circuit diagram intersections
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side
- User: Left side

12.
Label: updating users about changes in simulation

Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

14.
Label: expressing desire for convenience
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

16.
Label: feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

17.
Label: expressing admiration
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

18.
Label: states the focus on electricity and mechanics in physics lab
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

19.
Label: considering possibility
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

20.
Label: explaining common school policy
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

21.
Label: seeking guidance on pc version usage
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

22.
Label: responding to greetings
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

23.
Label: showing playfulness
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

24.
Label: discussing technical possibilities
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

25.
Label: emphasizes software functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

26.
Label: reveals potential use case
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

27.

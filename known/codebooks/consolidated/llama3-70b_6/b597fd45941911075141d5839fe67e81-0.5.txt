You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: consulting community
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

2.
Label: allocating resources
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

Label: confirming the common style of circuit diagram used in textbooks
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

22.
Label: considering future expansions
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

23.
Label: frustration
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

25.
Label: user 4229 builds rapport with designers
Quotes:

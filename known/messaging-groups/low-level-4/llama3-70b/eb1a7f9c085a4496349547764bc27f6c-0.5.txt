You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (10 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
10. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary phrases: expressing gratitude; acknowledging designer's effort
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about resource availability; seeking download information
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary phrases: expressing appreciation; acknowledging resource access
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary phrases: announcing upcoming changes; modifying simulation components
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary phrases: introducing new features; explaining component capabilities
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on capturing the essence of each message by identifying the actions, intentions, and emotions expressed. I'll consider the context of the online community, the roles of designers and users, and the emerging themes related to the Physics Lab platform. I'll also explore how the conversation unfolds, including the types of interactions, requests, and responses.

Interpretations for each message:

1. expressing gratitude; acknowledging designer's effort
2. inquiring about resource availability; seeking download information
3. expressing appreciation; acknowledging resource access
4. sharing visual content; facilitating communication
5. announcing upcoming changes; modifying simulation components
6. introducing new features; explaining component capabilities
7. soliciting user feedback; encouraging community engagement
8. seeking guidance; requesting usage instructions
9. sharing visual content; illustrating a point or question
10. providing system requirements; clarifying compatibility issues

Summary: The conversation begins with users expressing gratitude and seeking resources, followed by designers sharing information about upcoming changes and new features. The discussion then shifts to users seeking guidance on using the PC version and sharing visual content to facilitate understanding. Throughout the conversation, designers and users engage in a collaborative exchange, with designers soliciting feedback and providing clarification on system requirements.

Notes: A key theme emerging from this conversation is the collaborative nature of the online community, with designers and users engaging in a reciprocal exchange of information and resources. The conversation highlights the importance of feedback, guidance, and clarification in shaping the development and use of the Physics Lab platform.

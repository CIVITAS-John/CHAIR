You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: reveals environmental constraints
Quotes:
- User: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

2.
Label: outlining functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

3.
Label: updating about plans for new features
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

4.
Label: set user expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

Label: provides real world context
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

21.
Label: planning for improvements
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

22.
Label: explain intention of question
Quotes:
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school
- Designer: We are working on this part

23.
Label: sharing institutional constraints

24.
Label: highlights update significance
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

25.
Label: mentions potential future demonstration experiments based on user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

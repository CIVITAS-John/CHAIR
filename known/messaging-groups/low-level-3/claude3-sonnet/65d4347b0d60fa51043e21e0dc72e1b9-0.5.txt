You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, I will look for evidence of learning processes, user interactions with the system, and community dynamics around co-creation. Some guiding questions are: How are participants engaging with the system and each other to learn? What usability issues or design opportunities emerge? How is the community shaping the system's evolution?

Tags for each message:
1. specifying requirements; calculator application; rejecting existing solution
2. image sharing; visual communication
3. image sharing; visual communication 
4. asking for guidance; seeking instructions; new participant; onboarding
5. encouraging exploration; fun experimentation; designer perspective; promoting playfulness
6. questioning design change; seeking explanation; wave concept; feedback on system
7. expressing surprise; reacting to system behavior  
8. image sharing; visual communication; showcasing creation
9. image sharing; visual communication; showcasing creation
10. numerical input; experimenting with system

Summary: The conversation involves participants exploring Physics Lab, a system for creating simulations or applications. P5 expresses a desire to build a calculator without using an existing Minecraft solution. P6 shares images, potentially showcasing their creations. P7 joins as a new participant, asking for guidance on how to use the system. The designer encourages fun experimentation. P8 questions the addition of a wave feature, seeking explanation. P7 reacts with surprise, while P2 shares more images of their creations. P7 also inputs a number, experimenting with the system's functionality.

Notes: The conversation reveals an active community engaging with Physics Lab through exploration, creation, and discussion. Participants share their work visually and seek guidance, suggesting a need for clear onboarding and documentation. The designer promotes a playful, experimental approach. Feedback and questioning of design changes indicate user involvement in shaping the system's evolution. The numerical input and interest in building applications like calculators hint at the system's potential for computational thinking and project-based learning. Overall, the community seems to be co-creating and learning together through hands-on experimentation and dialogue.

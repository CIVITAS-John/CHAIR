You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: prioritizing pc updates, noting fast pc updates
Relationship: Inclusion (noting fast pc updates is a reason for prioritizing pc updates)
Criteria: The designer prioritizes PC updates and notes that they are usually the fastest.
Label: Prioritizing Fast PC Updates

2.
Concepts: download instructions, instructing on download location

Criteria: The speaker provides instructions on how to download software or access a resource, including guidance on the download location.
Label: Providing Download Instructions

3.
Concepts: facilitating access to software, providing software download information
Relationship: Intersection (facilitating access to software involves providing software download information)
Criteria: The speaker facilitates access to software, tools, or resources by providing information about downloading a specific software version.
Label: Facilitating Software Access

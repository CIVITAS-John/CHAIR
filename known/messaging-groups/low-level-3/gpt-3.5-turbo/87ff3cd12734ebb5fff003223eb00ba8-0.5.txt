You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
10. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Hello
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: There will be more people here after the official version is announced.
5. Designer: Probably because the teacher finds it annoying to talk too much ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image 6]
8. P5: ðŸ˜‚ Just to see if there are any good designs to draw inspiration from
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: Like a microcomputer

Thoughts: In analyzing the emergence of Physics Lab's online community, it's essential to consider the interactions between the designer and the users. From a learning sciences perspective, how do users engage with the platform's features? How does the designer facilitate learning through the platform? In terms of human-computer interaction, what design elements influence user interactions and community development? And through participatory design, how do users contribute to the evolution of the platform? These questions can guide the open coding process to uncover various aspects of the community's emergence.

Tags for each message:
1. Disapproval; Expression of disappointment; Nonverbal communication
2. Greeting; Social interaction; Community building
3. Greeting; Interaction with designer; Engagement
4. Community growth; Future expectations; Platform development
5. Teacher-student dynamics; Humor; Communication style
6. Greeting; Interaction with designer; Engagement
7. Nonverbal communication; Visual content
8. Design inspiration; User expectations; Creativity
9. Design evaluation; User feedback; Interaction with designer
10. Technology reference; User input; Platform features

Summary: The conversation unfolds with users expressing disapproval, greeting each other, and engaging with the designer. There are hints of community growth expectations, humor in teacher-student dynamics, and a focus on design inspiration and creativity. The users also provide feedback on design and mention specific technology references.

Notes: The users' interactions with the designer and each other seem to play a significant role in shaping the emerging online community. The dynamics between humor, feedback, and creativity could be key factors in fostering a sense of belonging and participation within Physics Lab's community.

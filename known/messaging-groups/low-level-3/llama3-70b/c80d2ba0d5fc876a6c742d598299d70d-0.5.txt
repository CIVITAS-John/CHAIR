6. Designer: We will be simpler, more practical (closer to exams), and cheaper.
7. P11: ðŸ˜‚
8. P11: Ask the group owner.
9. Designer: After all, we are not specialized in astronomy.
10. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
11. P2: [Image 144]
12. P2: From what I know currently.
13. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in the Physics Lab?
14. Designer: Motor simulation is more complicated, and it depends on the load.
15. Designer: Calculated...
16. P2: How to calculate it?
17. P11: Okay.
18. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
19. P11: [Image 152]
20. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but it is an atomic model.
21. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
22. P1: Server?
23. P11: Hahaha.
24. Designer: Standalone.
25. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
26. Designer: Two types of motors.
27. P1: Are you on the server?
28. P2: Brushed motor.
29. P2: Brushless motors are not connected to AC.
30. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
31. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
32. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
33. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple to follow the method I mentioned @Designer 
34. P14: [Image 168]
35. P2: What if it burns?

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Summary of previous conversation: This conversation continues to exhibit community building, knowledge sharing, and the designer's role in shaping the online community. Participants engage in social exchanges, share knowledge, and provide support, using multimedia sharing, questions, and clarifications to facilitate dialogue. The conversation touches on topics like astronomy education, motor simulations, and technical details. The designer's presence is evident, as they provide explanations, guidance, and encouragement, shaping the community dynamics.
1. P4: Making a motor is quite simple if you follow my method @Designer 
Preliminary tags: method sharing; @designer; community knowledge
2. P14: [Image 1-168]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
3. P2: What if it burns out?
Preliminary tags: burning out concern; technical risk
4. P4: Just power it up and play a rotating animation, that's it ðŸ˜‚
5. P2: Do you still need an algorithm?
6. P4: ðŸ˜‚ Simple and done
7. P2: Algorithms are not simple
8. P2: igdt can also be added @Designer 
9. P13: [Image 1-175]
10. P13: Are you all fake?
11. P13: Are you from outer space?
12. P13: I don't understand
13. P2: Transistors can also be used
14. Designer: You can make some fun components, but you can't do that in a normal experiment...
15. P11: ðŸ˜‚ That's in electronic circuits
16. P11: I don't understand either
17. P2: In the CPU
18. P11: Yes, this also belongs to electronic circuits. I learned a bit when I took an elective course on circuits
19. P2: Add a polarized capacitor
20. P2: I learned it all by myself
21. P11: That's great, if you have a passion for it
22. P14: @P11 Do they still separate arts and science tracks now?
23. P2: no
24. P11: We don't separate arts and science tracks anymore
25. P14: [Image 1-191]
26. P14: ...let me get admitted first and then we'll talk
27. P2: I'm still in 2nd year of middle school
28. P11: Keep it up
29. P13: First year of high school
30. P2: What about MOSFETs?
31. P2: @Designer 
32. P17: [Image 1-198]
33. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
34. P2: +1

Thoughts: In this conversation, I'll focus on identifying the emergence of the online community, exploring how participants interact, share knowledge, and engage with the designer. I'll examine the role of multimedia sharing, questions, and clarifications in facilitating dialogue. I'll also investigate how participants' backgrounds and experiences influence their contributions to the conversation. Guiding questions include: How do participants build on each other's ideas? How does the designer's presence shape the community dynamics? What topics and themes emerge in the conversation?

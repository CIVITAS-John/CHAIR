You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: proposing collaborative feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

2.
Label: detailing plans for advanced features
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

3.
Label: provide future plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

4.
Label: providing timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

5.
Label: requesting user manual
Quotes:
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school
- User: Need the user manual for this software
- User: Is there a user manual?

6.
Label: removing idealized components
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

7.

8.
Label: leveraging collective knowledge
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

9.
Label: advocating for teacher needs
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

10.
Label: justifying development decisions
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

11.
Label: self-help
Quotes:

Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

16.
Label: discuss input methods
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

17.
Label: explaining the significance of the circuit diagram feature for long term stability
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

18.
Label: announcing release timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

29.
Label: follow-up on design information
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

30.
Label: reducing complexity

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in the Physics Lab online community delves into various technical aspects such as motors, experimental results, and software, interspersed with humor and images. The Designer provides guidance on topics and future features, while members actively engage by seeking clarification and sharing their knowledge. The community's dynamics showcase a blend of technical curiosity, problem-solving, and camaraderie.
1. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
Preliminary tags: suggestion on electric motor construction
2. P14: [Image 168]

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: confirm design agreements, collaboration agreement
Relationship: The concepts are related in that confirmation of design agreements implies a mutual understanding and commitment to collaborate.
Criteria: Users and designers confirm and agree on design decisions and collaboration terms.
Phrase: Establishing shared understanding

2.
Concepts: engaging in co-development, engaging in mutual learning
Relationship: Co-development and mutual learning are interdependent, as collaborative development leads to learning opportunities and vice versa.
Criteria: Designers and users jointly develop the tool while exchanging knowledge and expertise.
Phrase: Collaborative knowledge exchange

3.
Concepts: discuss design constraints, acknowledge technical limitations
Relationship: Discussing design constraints implies acknowledging technical limitations that shape the design process.
Criteria: Designers openly discuss and acknowledge the technical limitations that influence design decisions.
Phrase: Recognizing technical boundaries

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1

1. P14: Except me.
2. P13: ＋1
3. P15: Plus one
4. P16: ＋1
5. P10: What does "+1" mean?
6. P11: It means "me too".
7. P13: +1 means the same opinion
8. P13: emmmm
9. P13: You can search on Baidu

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
This conversation starts with P14 expressing a differing opinion ("Except me"), followed by a series of "+1" responses from other participants, which sparks a question from P10 about the meaning of "+1". P11 and P13 clarify that "+1" means "me too" or sharing the same opinion.

* Plan
This conversation can be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do participants use online discourse markers to facilitate communication and build community? How do participants negotiate meaning and clarify understanding in an online environment? What role do online norms and conventions play in shaping the emergence of an online community?

# Social Norms

## Clarifying Understanding
Definition: Instances where participants seek or provide clarification on a concept or term.
- P10: What does "+1" mean?
- P11: It means "me too"
- P13: +1 means the same opinion

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Thoughts: The conversation so far provides some initial insights into the emergence of the Physics Lab online community. The first message from the Designer indicates that the community has been established, and the subsequent messages suggest how the users are engaging with it. There are signs of community participation, user support, and community management requests. The users also seem to be exploring the community dynamics, with questions about the membership and self-deprecating comments. To further understand the community's emergence, it would be helpful to analyze the context and tone of the messages, as well as any patterns or trends in the user interactions.

Summary: The conversation starts with the Designer indicating that the Physics Lab online community has been established. The users then begin to engage with the community, showing signs of participation, support, and management requests. There are also questions about the community membership and self-deprecating comments, suggesting the users are exploring the dynamics of the group. The "+" messages indicate agreement or a "me too" sentiment, further demonstrating the community participation. Overall, the conversation provides a glimpse into the early stages of the community's emergence, with users testing the waters and establishing their roles and interactions.

Notes: The community seems to be in its early stages, with users actively participating and exploring the group dynamics. The Designer's initial message suggests the community has been intentionally created, and the users are now responding to and shaping its development. The self-deprecating comments and questions about membership may indicate a sense of uncertainty or insecurity within the group, which could be an interesting area to explore further. The "+" messages suggest a desire for belonging and a sense of community solidarity. Analyzing the tone and context of the messages, as well as any patterns in the user interactions, could provide additional insights into how this online community is emerging.

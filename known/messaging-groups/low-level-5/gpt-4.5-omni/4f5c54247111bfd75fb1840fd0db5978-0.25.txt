1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 shares workaround; designer 1 references past experience; designer 1 uses informal tone
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 confirms understanding; user 4232 acknowledges designer's point; user 4232 engages in dialogue
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 requests export function; user 4232 suggests saving/importing experiments; user 4232 highlights classroom application
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 confirms future feature; designer 1 reassures user; designer 1 commits to implementation
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 inquires about internet access; designer 1 seeks contextual information; designer 1 considers practical constraints
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 explains lack of internet; user 4232 provides context; user 4232 shares incident affecting policy
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- Some categories like "research practices" and "experiment components" seem quite distinct and may not need merging.
- The "technical" categories could potentially be merged into one overarching "Technical" category.
- The naming could be improved in some cases to better reflect the merged scope.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (10 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
10. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary phrases: sharing teaching background
2. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
Preliminary phrases: announcing software update; estimating release timeframe
3. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
Preliminary phrases: apologizing for disturbance
4. User-4233: How to download?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about download process
5. User-4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary phrases: apologizing for interruption
6. Designer-2: Group sharing.
Preliminary phrases: suggesting group sharing feature
7. Designer-1: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. Designer-1: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
9. User-4234: [Emoji 2-56]
10. User-4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on capturing the essence of each message, considering the context of the online community's emergence. I'll explore how the designers and users interact, share information, and respond to each other. Guiding questions include: What are the designers' roles in shaping the community? How do users respond to updates and features? What are the power dynamics at play in this online space?

Interpretations for each message:

1. sharing teaching background; introducing oneself
2. announcing software update; estimating release timeframe; setting expectations
3. apologizing for disturbance; showing consideration for others
4. inquiring about download process; seeking guidance
5. apologizing for interruption; showing politeness
6. suggesting group sharing feature; promoting collaboration
7. providing download instructions; offering assistance
8. announcing feature updates; soliciting feedback; encouraging participation
9. expressing excitement or playfulness; using humor
10. expressing enthusiasm or agreement; using humor

Summary: The conversation begins with a user introducing themselves, followed by a designer announcing an update to Physics Lab. The conversation then shifts to users inquiring about downloads and features, with designers responding with guidance and updates. The tone is collaborative, with designers encouraging feedback and users expressing enthusiasm.

Notes: The designers seem to be taking an active role in shaping the community, providing updates and guidance. Users are engaging with the designers, seeking information and providing feedback. The use of emojis and apologies suggests a lighthearted and respectful tone in the community. I'll continue to explore how this dynamic evolves and how the community emerges over time.

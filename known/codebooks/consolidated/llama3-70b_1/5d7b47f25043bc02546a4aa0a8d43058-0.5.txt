1.
Label: express concern over learner's understanding of scope
Quotes:
- E01: And I find what I have trouble with and certainly what beginners have trouble with is "scope".   You know, when you go from one point to another and all of a sudden you're, you're not no longer in ask turtles to do something you're in, ask links to do. But you know, so all of a sudden you've shifted, you've shifted your variable space and this happens implicitly and all of a sudden you're writing code and then it gives you an error that of the nature X Y Z doesn't operate in a turtle context. (interviewer's observation) AI needs to support learning of the "scope" concept in NetLogo.

2.
Label: recognizes the time saving aspect
Quotes:
- E04: And it could take a lot of time to like search the documentation and go online and try and figure out all those answers and just to have it like right there. So you can kind of stay within the task is really nice. (interviewer's observation) The capability to search for documentation and read it inside the workspace: esp. beneficial for novices.

3.

Quotes:
- E01: I have I found with with playing with with ChatGPT. And I was something at Python, I think I tried to give it the code. And I tried to run it generated error. And then I would go back to the next prompt and ChatGPT. And I go, that code is good. But it generates the following error. And I list the error online on this line, and I'd quote the line. And I say, Can you fix that?  (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug in the generated code, he refers to his previous practice with asking ChatGPT to debug with the code, the error message, and the line number. Interviewer did what E01 said.

5.
Label: express desire for efficient learning
Quotes:
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time.

10.
Label: finds ai error messages incorrect
Quotes:
- E04: maybe you saw something that I didn't, but from my perspective, it seemed as though the code was set up appropriately, but it was marking the syntax as wrong. So maybe I was missing something, but I didn't see anything missing. So that was kind of frustrating. (interviewer's observation) Shows error messages even when it seems to be correct (that's a bug identified)

11.

(interviewer's observation) AI could help people to ask more questions, more early and often, to save cost for the future.

13.
Label: discusses code quality
Quotes:
- E01: You know, so in point of fact, I considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can.

Quotes:
- E04: It doesn't... Include everything that you need.  (interviewer's observation) Misses code structures at times.

20.
Label: envisions streamlined communication with user groups
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.

21.

- E01: So maybe the details are wrong and, you know, Michael Tamalo or somebody jumped on me because I posted some answer and it used some function that wasn't available. AI had hallucinated some function. (interviewer's observation) AI might hallucinates.

26.
Label: implies need for better documentation
Quotes:

It's, it is not documented anywhere.  (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on knowledge in pieces - how they are generated and sustained.

27.
Label: critiques obsession with self reliance
Quotes:
- E01: But you know, again, you have this culture, especially in the US of do your own work. People get a little too obsessive about doing their own work.  (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on U.S. individualistic working culture.

30.
Label: engages with multiple support resources
Quotes:
- E04: I'll go on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, I'm part of the NetLogo listserv, but obviously there's a delay there. So in the instance that I need immediate feedback, it is really helpful. (interviewer's observation) Nice to have immediate feedback.

31.
Label: ai ability (positive): fast iteration
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

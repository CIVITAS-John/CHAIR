Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, which may produce some weird results.
2. Designer: [Image 102]
3. Designer: Thank you for your support. We will do better!
4. P4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 104]
5. Designer: There will be an update. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version next weekend.
6. Designer: The update is quite substantial...
7. P4236: [Emoji 107]
8. P4234: [Emoji 108]
9. Designer: Don't worry, it will be done. We will optimize the circuit diagram in the final round.
10. Designer: Although manual layout adjustments are possible
11. Designer: It's still better to make the automatically generated one as good as possible
12. P4234: Yes, the spirit of continuous improvement like a skilled craftsman ðŸ¤”
13. Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that ensures long-term stability after implementation... Adding various components actually makes it simpler
14. Designer: The Apple Store is still under review, let's upload the PC version first
15. Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
Enhanced the 3D appearance of various types of meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeters and zero adjustment for meters.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments

Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal and real modes.

# Special Note

The Esc key now minimizes the window.

Ctrl+E can switch between exam and normal modes.
16. P4237: [Emoji 116]
17. Designer: The new version has been sent in the group
18. Designer: iOS is waiting for review~
19. P4237: [Emoji 119]
20. P4237: ok
21. P4232: [Emoji 121]
22. Designer: The one in the group is the PC version
23. Designer: Android is expected to be updated tonight
24. Designer: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch
25. P4238: Android hasn't been updated yet?
26. P4238: Updated

Label: identify student engagement issues
Quotes:
- Contributor 2: Main problem: students are having a hard time staying engaged and have trouble finding motivation to complete and interact with the course content.
Solutions
1. Part of my research for the MT program at OISE looks at increasing student motivation and engagement specifically in Physical Education classes via the use of music integration. I believe that by using music in the class while facilitating games or exercises for your students can greatly increase their motivation and make the class more fun. This increases their engagement especially if they are listening to music that they like. Think of it like going to the gym to workout most people go to workout and listen to music at the same time.
2. Another way to improve student engagement and motivation would be to incorporate gamified learning. Students can begin to learn by playing games that aim to touch on the learning goal for that period. Students can be offered points or rewards for adopting sustainable behaviours or solving problems. This can foster friendly and healthy competition and promote fun in learning new things
3. Another method to increase student engagement is through relationship building. Teachers need to actively try to engage with students and make efforts to get to know them so that they know how to best guide each student on their learning journey. Taking the time to get to know students is acccessible and sustainable to all and goes a long way :)
We also think that this problem relates to this facet . This is because we believe that one of the key factors to improving student engagement and motivation is to build strong relationships with students and safe classroom environments. This will help students feel comfortable in their learning environment and more welcome in the classroom.

Label: propose class as sustainable city
Quotes:
- Contributor 10: I'm wondering if we can assume that the entire class is a sustainable city. Each group represents a community. Each community chooses a relevant topic to do research on (extensive reading, fieldwork, etc.). Thus, each student is playing a part in improving not only their local 'neighbourhood' but also the sustainability of the city as a whole.

Label: emphasize student interest in gamified learning
Quotes:
- Contributor 9: I really like this groups idea of incorporating music into physical education class in order to increase students engagement. I agree that by playing popular songs, this might increase students energy levels and interest if they like that particular song. I also agree that students might become more engaged by incorporating gamified learning. This is a very interesting concept, however, I think the student themselves need to be interested in this way of learning, otherwise it will not increase their engagement. Furthermore, I think the most important way to increase students engagement would be as this group mentioned, building a relationship with the students. Typically, students will not engage if they are not interested in what they are learning or the activity they are doing. The way to learn about these interests is through building a relation with the student and learning what they enjoy. This way, they can create personalized plans to help encourage each student to participate.

Quotes:
- Contributor 8: I loved the question from Contributor 9 about the traditional filed trip in the sustainability and I thought about the need for learners to get facilitation from the teachers on the need to brainstorm the expactations of the traditional filed trip with a focus on curriculum related issues while generating ides and setting the golas ahead of their trip by forming inquiry groups that are tasked with research topics on respective group's goals.
During the traditional trip this is where the students exercise the principle of    by actively answering their pre-trip questions through discussing in their previously formed groups.

Quotes:
- Contributor 16: Thanks for sharing your group good ideas
I like the idea about creat a workshop.The proposed solution of hosting knowledge-building workshops for parents and educators is a great initiative, especially in the context of sustainability and long-term impact.I think there is a suggesttion can improve to doing the workshop such as ongoing Engagement through Community Building: Sustainability can be further supported by creating a community around these workshops. Regular follow-up sessions, online discussion groups, or forums where parents and educators can share experiences and challenges will keep the conversation going.
By embedding knowledge-building principles into everyday school interactions and community networks, the workshops can have a lasting, transformative effect on how both parents and educators view children's learning and development.

Label: emphasize statistical knowledge
Quotes:
- Contributor 6: In some research development projects there would be very intense collaboration going on with computer modelling and analysis. In this context the key struggle might come through as teacher sense-making and data interpretation. I think it is key that all members in the group including the teachers should have basic statistical knowledge in order to collaborate and sustain a quality discourse on important topics. 
The harsh reality is that computer science people are comparably fluid in their job market but if someone is willing to stay and contribute it will be good to keep them. In this way not only they get job security, the team dynamic is also sustained and the ideas could keep flowing.

Label: propose inquiry based projects
Quotes:
- Contributor 17: In order to build on the ideas that my group has come up with as well as build off of the points Contributor 31 has shared with us such as:

and 
 
 would be to incorporate more inquiry based projects where students are leaders in their learning journeys. After students have conducted research and offered solutions to proposed problems, they could present their ideas and findings at a parent panel or community panel to spread their acquired new knowledge with others. Parents/ panel members could then share what they learned online in some sort of blogging program style or simply share what they learned orally with their own community members. This idea connects to  because it involves . Students could present their ideas and findings which would likely include new inventions, methods or systems that they have come up with which commects with which means. A prompt that could be used for this could possibly be something like 'How do you think citiies all over the world could reduce waste?' This kind of prompt will allow for students to think in their own individual ways while all working towards the same goal. They will also have to which supports the Knowledge Building Principle. incorporating more opportunity for reflection from students and prompting students by asking questions like 'What did you hear your peers share that you haven't thought of before?' or 'How could you build on that persons ideas?' This approach allows for more  because . Having students reflect on the ideas of their peers is very beneficial however, it would also be very beneficial to have students engaging and reflecting on their own evolution of their solutions through meta-cognitive reflection. is having students working towards a collective goal or prompt such as the one listed above and practicing which highlights . This would allow students to in a larger group setting, hear the ideas of others and also relates to the idea of collective responsibility. -

Label: suggest sustainable city symposium
Quotes:
- Contributor 34: Encourage students to represent their ideas in multiple forms—drawings, models, graphs, and narratives—to expand the problem space. Have students create diverse artefacts, such as concept maps of sustainable city features, infographics about energy sources, or artistic depictions of future cities. Use these artefacts to explore contrasting ideas and perspectives, driving collective understanding forward. Let students decide on the specific aspects of sustainable cities they want to explore, such as green energy, waste management, or building materials. Allow them to monitor their progress, set new directions, and share their findings with the class and the broader community. Introduce a “Sustainable City Symposium” where students regularly present their evolving ideas, receive critical feedback, and reflect on progress. Encourage them to connect their discussions to historical, cultural, and Indigenous perspectives on land use and urban development. Encourage students to look beyond superficial solutions to explore the deeper, interacting systems involved in urban sustainability, such as energy use, building materials, and cultural beliefs. Students might research how urban design affects the environment and connect building rocks and minerals to energy sources utilized in cities.
   Use collaborative digital tools (like a shared online forum) where every student can post their thoughts, questions, and resources.  Make it a classroom norm to engage thoughtfully with each contribution, magnifying the value of diverse perspectives.
   Move from static project designs to a dynamic and evolving inquiry in which students' ideas are treated as improvable, by having them develop initial designs for sustainable cities, then revisiting and refining them in light of new insights, peer feedback, and research on energy and environmental resources. This could also enable them to use Indigenous knowledge and traditional ecological wisdom to rethink aspects of their design entailing material use, energy consumption, and land stewardship.
   Frame the exploration in real-world challenges that cities are facing today, such as urban sprawl, energy consumption, and access to sustainable materials. Allow students to research and bring in case studies from Indigenous perspectives on land use and resource management.Students may explore questions like, 'How can we use city energies without harming the environment?' or 'What might we learn from traditional Indigenous ways in regard to using rocks and minerals sustainably?
   Connect their classroom work with community efforts on urban sustainability. Invite guest speakers (e.g., urban planners, and Indigenous leaders) to discuss real-world applications, providing new contexts for their ideas to evolve. -
- Contributor 31: Thank you to your team for the fruitful note and ideas about to move forward.  This has given me a lot to think about.
I welcome efforts to deepen any of the suggestions you have made.
Initially I am particularly thinking about Knowledge Building Discourse, and how to approach the design with respect to that principle.
I was intrigued by these suggestions:

AND

 
When we consider the proto-to-systemic descriptions related to Knowledge Building, how can we take designs a bit deeper?
In particular I am thinking about facets such as   and 
 
   considering specific structures in the classroom that would address Knowledge Building discourse in this context. 
What might be particular scaffolds that would   ?
 
How would a 'Sustainable City Symposium' be structured to foster a Knowledge Building discourse path?  What would it look and sound like? As I mentioned, there are so many ideas to consider in your note. All of the principles are connected so any improvements do not just have to link to KB Discourse.  It is just a focal point in this note for moving forward. I welcome any building on related to any ideas!

Label: emphasize accessibility
Quotes:
- Contributor 3: Sustainability in education and technology could refer to many different practices and strategies that ensure educational practices and technological systems are maintained in ways that benefit current and future generations without depleting resources or causing long-term harm to society, or even the environment. Our group had many different interpretations of what this could mean:Contributor 35: My mind immediately went to Data Privacy and Security. With the increase of digital platforms and online learning tools, student data privacy and security have become major concerns in schools and in fact, a concern for anyone using technology. There are serious concerns around data privacy and ethical usage, as we see more discourse on where we draw the lines, deeper conversation about digital literacy, and AI readiness. These concerns are particularly significant because education involves sensitive information about minors and vulnerable populations.Solution:
   In Knowledge Building, the community shares responsibility for advancing knowledge ('Collective Responsibility for Advancing Community Knowledge' (From Proto to Systemic Knowledge Building by Marlene Scardamalia). This principle can be applied as a solution by encouraging collective efforts across teams (e.g., AI developers, security experts, teachers, data scientists, and policymakers) to continuously update and refine AI security protocols.Encouraging collective efforts across different experts, to continuously update and refine AI and other learning tools is a sustainable way to leverage expert knowledge, and build these tools with human well-being and pedogogy in mind.  
Contributor 37: From a designer’s perspective, the educational sustainability issue that first comes to mind is the use of eco-friendly materials in the classroom. Contributor 28 has also mentioned the knowledge and ways of thinking needed to achieve economic prosperity. Building on this, technology could serve as a powerful solution for reducing the physical costs of classroom activities by transitioning to digital resources that minimize paper waste and energy consumption. 
In addition, I think accessibility in education also involves considering social sustainability and ensuring that learning tools and environments are inclusive of different languages, cultural perspectives, and learning needs.
Solution: using technology, the knowledge could be built into dynamic, recyclable and expandable learning modules/communities.  And from this perspective we could use encourage students to share diverse viewpoints on sustainability practices and design solutions that cater to different needs.
Yuqi:Technology and education involve the interaction between humans and computers. When considering sustainability in technology and education, we should consider both the sustainable use of technology and the sustainability of human resources and societal systems.
Contributor 30:    During our conversation about technology and school sustainability, we touched on a number of crucial topics. The growing worry over data privacy was one important factor, especially in light of the increased use of digital platforms in education. We also discussed the necessity of responsible tech use in the classroom, meaning pupils use it for meaningful learning rather than just busy work, and the shift to digital materials to cut down on waste. Another hot topic was accessibility, since not every student has equal access to technology, which might make it difficult to create a fair learning environment. When taken as a whole, these observations show how important it is to approach the sustainable integration of technology in education with caution and moderation.Contributor 28: Technology in Education; can refer to many facets of teaching/learning provided that technology is present is some shape or form. EX the SAMR model (Substitution, Aumentation, Modification, Redefinition) once youve figured out your discourse and how to use your technology responsibly I beelive that it can be a huge support in teaching. Furthermore the sustainability comes to reposnible usage of the tech in the classsroom and the preparedness of the students to use if responsibly. Some possible drawbacks to technology in education would strictly be due to accessibility issues. how available is the tech, are there pay walls and can each and every student use it regardless of economic background.    the SAMR model was shared acroos the board and not just in educational fields allowing for anyone implementing tech in educations to really thing about the way the use technology in an educational format that can support students and not just 'busy work' Contributor 10: Professional development immediately comes to mind. I believe that we must first equip educational practitioners in order to achieve the sustainability of education and technology. If they could not successfully incorporate these theories and have access to ongoing technologies and practices, how could they pass this to their students in learning process?
- Contributor 17: Your proposal for workshops to promote knowledge building is an exciting approach that addresses the essential need for parental engagement in education. As we know, not all parents are able to be extremely involved with what their children are doing at school.
  To progress this initiative, I propose a Knowledge Sharing Community App designed to allow parents to engage from the comfort of their own homes/spaces and on their own time. This app could be used on smartphones, tablets and online websites. It would foster continuous involvement from the community. Think of it as a very large group chat of sorts where parents and other community members can share videos, events, extracurricular activity ideas, and the recordings of those workshops that you spoke about in your post. This could allow parents to watch these recordings on their own time. Additionally, following these workshops, parents could leave feedback about the session and suggestions for future sessions. This promotes knowledge building as it allows for a multitude of different perspectives. An app that encompasses all of these different facets of education, has the potential to increase engagement and motivation from the wider parental community. A potential limitation with this could be that parents could still opt to not participate in the app however, having it on a mobile app could really increase engagement from parents because it is more accessible. -

In using Artificial Intelligence in such a way, the rubric criteria are slowly introduced as the student pro-actively engages with their own learning process, to allow them to find and meet their own challenges in real time. This dynamic procedure nurtures not only a sense of community, but also assures that students are constantly engaged in reflections and improvements of their contributions toward an advance in group knowledge. Nowadays, the achievement charts is that there very restrictive and narrow-minded.

After our first brainstorm iteration, we have gone back and thought about such a tool from a sustainability perspective. Two wonderings came from this:

Could such a tool help students who are otherwise 'invisible' or missed by teachers to get prompt and useful feedback. In a classroom of 30 students, some students's needs will inevitably get more attention than others.
Could such a tool re-entrench access issues, if it is not culturally responsive/diverse, and thus is more adapted to interface with certain students?

However,    is that students are not sure when expectations of a task are being met as the AI continues to provide suggestions for improvement. While this 'snowball effect' is great to support KB, as students in a world with a grading system, we feel it would be hepful to know when we are below, metting, or exceeding expectations. This was previously discussed in Week 2 build-on notes by Contributor 23 and Contributor 36. As an experiment, we tried the generative feedback on the above. Below is the feedback we were given. We noted that suggestion #3 was to provide a soultion. We feel that we already met this expectation as we suggested a flag of being below, meeting, or exceeding expectations. Why is the AI not seeing this as a suggested solution? We then discussed as a group that we have noticed a pattern where the AI provides a suggestion that we feel has already been met.

Label: suggest proto to systemic kb principles
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: I like the suggestion of annotating sources, and this could work with Grade 4 and 5 students, depending on the source.  I am thinking of starting with something simple and then moving to more expert sources as we progress, and as the students find them.  (One of the students is already coming to chat with me at recess about Stanley Meyer, who he says invented a hydrogen car and died mysteriously.  I am not sure how 'mysteries' like this will fit into this work but there is probably a place for critically analyzing them!)
To start I might create a note like this, which has a copy of the text from this website 
Knowledge Forum has an annotation feature, which I am showing in this screenshot:

Hopefully you can see how some text is highlighted near the bottom and there is space for an annotation.
We will use other sources as well but they can't all be pasted into a note like this, particularly if they are from hard copy books or even digital books.  
I am thinking that annotation could support this facet of the Proto-to-Systemic KB principles: 

I also think the students could work in a view where they cite the reading material and use it to improve designs, like we do in this course.  
I would love to hear any suggestions about how to structure the annotation process or about any possible scaffolds to support reading for design, or constructive use of authoritative sources with this age group.
Thanks for the inspiration!

Label: integrate knowledge building principles
Quotes:
- Contributor 4: Workshops: Schools can host knowledge building information workshops which emphasize the importance of knowledge building. The goal is to raise awareness on what knowledge building is, foster an environement at home where knowledge can be built. Teach parents teaching for learning vs teaching for understanding. Different institutions can also host these workshops where learning is happening for children. 
Applicable to real life situation: challenge in schools in China parents want academic improvement in children, they do not put importance on extracirricular activities. They are not aware of how these activities can help them with holistic growth (another way of knoweldge buikding). Knowledge building is not restricted to school environements, it can happen in various environments where children need to go. 
Sustainability of Workshops: We must make sure the workshops can go on for a long period of time. They should not just end after a short period of time. Ways we can achieve this would be to offer these workshops using different delivery methods (in person, online). It could also be something that is brought up in student/teacher interviews. This is applicable if teachers are also involved in the knowledge building process. It is important that the workshops themselves are presented using knowledge building and not traditional teaching.

I love that idea!    Thinking of the entire class as a sustainable city where each group represents a community really brings a sense of interconnectedness to the project. It would also give students the opportunity to see how their individual efforts contribute to the bigger picture of sustainability.

They can do an interview style where they ask questions of one another. Then the bigger interest group can get together and each pair shares what they learned from the other person. If this group is big (8-10 people), they can divide into two bigger groups. This way, everyone is able to contribute to the collective knowledge of the whole. They then can take the information of what they heard and spend time bringing it back to their original group (the group they are building the city with) and share some big ideas that they had taken away. There are multiple exit tickets available. One can be that they are prepared to have something they share to their original group.

Label: propose reflective prompts
Quotes:
- Contributor 30: What if we could make this system more capable of tracking student participation and encouraging introspection about how they use reputable sources to get knowledge? Since it is in line with many of the previously described principles, I support the idea of using an AI-based scoring system to improve knowledge-building (KB) procedures. In this case, Improvable Ideas are crucial since the AI can provide dynamic, scaffolded feedback that changes as students develop. Epistemic Agency is also essential, since students would guide their own learning according to the AI's evaluation of their discourse abilities, resulting in feedback that is both relevant and individualized. The idea behind the hidden score is to promote collective responsibility, community knowledge through multi-grade collaboration that guarantees a diversity of viewpoints. Every student, regardless of ability level, contributes meaningfully to conversations, demonstrating Democratizing Knowledge. dawidGroup 4! your idea of using an AI-based scoring system to adjust feedback and match students based on their discourse skills is a great way to support Improvable Ideas and Transformative Assessment. By tailoring challenges to each student’s level, it encourages continuous growth. Adding reflective prompts could enhance Epistemic Agency, helping students take ownership of their progress. The multi-grade collaboration concept, where high-score students act as peer tutors, aligns well with Community Knowledge and motivates all students to actively engage in learning. -

Label: suggest epistemic agency
Quotes:
- Contributor 36: Using the school scenario or classroom as a case study to apply sustainable urban design concepts to broader contexts is a valuable approach. By framing the school itself as a 'small city,' students can exercise epistemic agency and bring in their own creative ideas to make the environment more sustainable. Allowing students to redesign their school or even visit and improve another school (I have witnessed in some scenarios this idea take place with older students and have significant results), while aligning with collective responsibility, fosters a real-world application that remains within a controlled environment.
Drawing from my experience in a Jewish school, one sustainability initiative involved turning off electricity for an entire day, encouraging outdoor activities. While collective responsibility was evident, epistemic agency was less emphasized. If we embrace the principle of idea diversity, students could propose even more varied and innovative ways to make their environment sustainable, from smaller changes in their school to potential city-wide applications.
Incorporating local and global contexts would require prompts or frameworks that encourage students to see how their school-based ideas could scale up to influence broader urban design issues. For example, you might ask students: How could your ideas for a sustainable school be applied to public spaces or larger city infrastructure? This could encourage them to think beyond their immediate surroundings while ensuring they remain grounded in real ideas and authentic problems.
Additionally, using peer feedback and integrating community perspectives (like those from local environmental experts or Indigenous knowledge) can enrich the conversation. This provides students with authoritative sources while also promoting critical thinking about how local and global solutions intersect. Ultimately, structuring the classroom as a knowledge-building community where students are both the designers and the decision-makers allows for deeper engagement and more meaningful learning.
 
- Contributor 32: Here are our thoughts on what aspects of the STEM challenge are at odds with Knowledge Building, and some toughts on how to address these issues.

'Learn first, produce later' assumption

Both      and      are relevant here. In true Knowledge Building, learning happens through the authentic production of new knowledge.
   Students should be determine and adjust what are the important concepts, rather than being told what is crucial knowledge. True Knoweldge Building must creative knowledge work, contribute to communcal knowledge.
Reflect meaningfully and in dialogue with others on the integration of Indigenous knowledge.


team formation only happens after original learning takes place

   Team-building should happen in the initial stages, and there should be a mix of achievement levels. teams are assigned a specifc aspect of urban design

   We would prefer students to have more epistemic agency when it comes to narrowing down what aspect they want to work on. all the work is segmented, everyone is assigned a specific roles; no opportunistic collaboration

   Everything should be shared, and everyone should have equal access to what is being produced. Knowledge building in a group setting should involve contributions from all members, the learning is mutually beneficial. Students should be able to improve on each other's ideas, instead of being confined to one subject matter. Assessment should reflect the group, and not individual contributions. We suggest having touchstones and crosstalks between groups mediated/modelled by teacher as needed.


formative feedback rolling throughout
   students are not given an opportunity to iterate through their ideas -
- Contributor 35: Some practical ideas to incorporate more KB Principles, and to move forward with this assignment could include: 

After teams design their city aspects, have them meet with other teams to discuss how their design impacts or supports others (e.g., how energy affects transportation). This promotes    After initial designs, teams exchange their ideas with others for constructive feedback, allowing for    to emerge and refining their designs. '' 


Let teams propose additional city features or challenges beyond their initial focus or letting them pick their focus, fostering    and deeper engagement with the content. ()


Create a digital space where students can post their research findings. This builds    and allows all teams to access and benefit from everyone's contributions. (

A big part of this course is ensuring that we speak to all 12 KB principles in our written entries. It would be helpful to get AI feedback on how well we are tracking to that goal.
Additionally, to ensure we are using diverse scaffolds across all categories (Theory Building, Reflecting on Practice, Design Mode, KB Principles, Reading for Knowledge Acquisition, etc), getting feedback on the scaffolds we haven't yet used, or tend to shy away from, would help promote new ways of thinking/ address any blindspots.

Label: promote local problem engagement
Quotes:
- Contributor 33: Encouraging students to express their interests on the first day, rather than presenting predefined sustainability problems, enhances epistemic agency. Having students work in their groups of interest will allow them to focus on different aspects of the curriculum while also learning about something that they are very passionate about. This approach empowers students to take ownership of their learning by allowing them to choose areas of focus that resonate with them. It fosters greater engagement, as students are more likely to invest in topics they feel connected to. This type of work also shows students that their ideas are valued and that they have control over their learning. This strategy not only aligns with knowledge building principles but also helps cultivate a more dynamic and participatory classroom environment. Another important aspect to emphasize is the principle of constructive use of authoritative sources during student research. Encourage students not to avoid complex knowledge sources and to appreciate expert opinions. However, they should also recognize the value of personal experiences and insights that may not be readily available online. This approach fosters a more holistic understanding of sustainability, allowing students to integrate various forms of knowledge and perspectives into their projects, ultimately enriching their learning experience and community discussions.
 Incorporating diverse perspectives, such as those of elders or Indigenous communities, into the study of sustainable practices encourages students to look beyond immediate sources of information. It is essential that we look to authentic sources for information and not try to retell their lived experiences through our own perspectives. This aligns with the principle of idea diversity and promotes a deeper understanding of how to use the land sustainably. Additionally, valuing peer feedback allows students to reflect on their own viewpoints, fostering a collaborative learning environment where multiple ideas can coexist and enhance the community's overall knowledge base.
 Encouraging students to tackle real ideas and authentic problems within their own community, rather than focusing on a random city, significantly enhances engagement and relevance. This approach allows them to apply their learning directly to their surroundings, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility. By addressing local challenges, students can explore sustainable practices that impact their lives and the lives of those around them, leading to meaningful contributions and a deeper understanding of community dynamics. This alignment with local issues promotes both motivation and practical knowledge application. Further, having students think of ideas and how to enhance and work with Indigenous communities could be a great way to get them more involved with learning how to preserve the land and be more cautious




 Through an approach such as this one, students have to take ownership of their own learning and their contributions to the broader community. Having students then present their findings and ideas to the class or other small groups in a seminar type of formation in the class. -

Label: highlight data privacy and security
Quotes:
- Contributor 3: Sustainability in education and technology could refer to many different practices and strategies that ensure educational practices and technological systems are maintained in ways that benefit current and future generations without depleting resources or causing long-term harm to society, or even the environment. Our group had many different interpretations of what this could mean:Contributor 35: My mind immediately went to Data Privacy and Security. With the increase of digital platforms and online learning tools, student data privacy and security have become major concerns in schools and in fact, a concern for anyone using technology. There are serious concerns around data privacy and ethical usage, as we see more discourse on where we draw the lines, deeper conversation about digital literacy, and AI readiness. These concerns are particularly significant because education involves sensitive information about minors and vulnerable populations.Solution:
   In Knowledge Building, the community shares responsibility for advancing knowledge ('Collective Responsibility for Advancing Community Knowledge' (From Proto to Systemic Knowledge Building by Marlene Scardamalia). This principle can be applied as a solution by encouraging collective efforts across teams (e.g., AI developers, security experts, teachers, data scientists, and policymakers) to continuously update and refine AI security protocols.Encouraging collective efforts across different experts, to continuously update and refine AI and other learning tools is a sustainable way to leverage expert knowledge, and build these tools with human well-being and pedogogy in mind.  
Contributor 37: From a designer’s perspective, the educational sustainability issue that first comes to mind is the use of eco-friendly materials in the classroom. Contributor 28 has also mentioned the knowledge and ways of thinking needed to achieve economic prosperity. Building on this, technology could serve as a powerful solution for reducing the physical costs of classroom activities by transitioning to digital resources that minimize paper waste and energy consumption. 
In addition, I think accessibility in education also involves considering social sustainability and ensuring that learning tools and environments are inclusive of different languages, cultural perspectives, and learning needs.
Solution: using technology, the knowledge could be built into dynamic, recyclable and expandable learning modules/communities.  And from this perspective we could use encourage students to share diverse viewpoints on sustainability practices and design solutions that cater to different needs.
Yuqi:Technology and education involve the interaction between humans and computers. When considering sustainability in technology and education, we should consider both the sustainable use of technology and the sustainability of human resources and societal systems.
Contributor 30:    During our conversation about technology and school sustainability, we touched on a number of crucial topics. The growing worry over data privacy was one important factor, especially in light of the increased use of digital platforms in education. We also discussed the necessity of responsible tech use in the classroom, meaning pupils use it for meaningful learning rather than just busy work, and the shift to digital materials to cut down on waste. Another hot topic was accessibility, since not every student has equal access to technology, which might make it difficult to create a fair learning environment. When taken as a whole, these observations show how important it is to approach the sustainable integration of technology in education with caution and moderation.Contributor 28: Technology in Education; can refer to many facets of teaching/learning provided that technology is present is some shape or form. EX the SAMR model (Substitution, Aumentation, Modification, Redefinition) once youve figured out your discourse and how to use your technology responsibly I beelive that it can be a huge support in teaching. Furthermore the sustainability comes to reposnible usage of the tech in the classsroom and the preparedness of the students to use if responsibly. Some possible drawbacks to technology in education would strictly be due to accessibility issues. how available is the tech, are there pay walls and can each and every student use it regardless of economic background.    the SAMR model was shared acroos the board and not just in educational fields allowing for anyone implementing tech in educations to really thing about the way the use technology in an educational format that can support students and not just 'busy work' Contributor 10: Professional development immediately comes to mind. I believe that we must first equip educational practitioners in order to achieve the sustainability of education and technology. If they could not successfully incorporate these theories and have access to ongoing technologies and practices, how could they pass this to their students in learning process?

Quotes:
- Contributor 21: One weakness with this AI feedback tool is that it does not fully understand the specific details or personal perferences. This can lead to responses which might not be fully aligned with our personal needs or expectations for a response. It also does not have any emotional understanding or empathy which one may find in a human feedback provider. This can limit the effectiveness of its' responses to the individual. Contributor 9 Razaiy Contributor 28   AI Often have several limitations and do not always have all the answers. Having the AI link where it pulled its information from allowing you access it and further research on your own would be a great improvemnet. Also when generating feedback provide examples of what a 'complete answer may look like or a checklist of what may be missing from your answer. Examining how the AI might adjust to individual tastes by gaining knowledge from user input over time and providing more customized feedback is a fresh perspective on this. Additionally, it might offer direct connections to the information's original sources, enabling readers to go further and independently confirm the data. A set of guidelines or checklist that provides examples of strong responses would also be helpful in providing more precise suggestions on how to get better. By including these functions, the AI may be able to encourage a more deliberate and introspective learning process rather than just providing rapid feedback. Ting I can receive quick feedback from AI to see how my assignment is coming along. You can also examine the issues that surface in other students' schoolwork at the same time.
  I notice that there are three scaffolds: 'How do I start?', 'Reflect on our discourse', and 'Plan for deeper work'. we add more to better guide us in thinking and make the feedback more productive? For example, to contrast or compare different notes, etc.  so that it could also be used to boost more exchange between the ideas.

Label: propose interdisciplinary integration
Quotes:
- Contributor 19: Hi Contributor 31. Thanks for your feedback on our note, and for the follow up question. You are right, we perhaps didn't manage our time terribly effectively so we spent most of it writing out our thoughts on what was 'wrong' with the original project, from KB standpoint.
To your point about how students could be asked to iterate through their ideas in the project, I'm left thinking with what Prof. Scardamalia was mulling during the lecture: Can it be done in four days? There are different tools and approaches that can be used to make best use of that time, but I'm actually thinking about pushing back against that time constraint.
   In the spirit of this week's reading on interdisciplinary crisscrossing, the proposed project/topic might benefit from being spaced out over a long period of time. Integrating more subjects/curricula explicitly could help allocate more classroom time to it, but it might also be beneficial to simply spread out the same number of hours to shorter and periodic work sessions, while also tooling students to think, research, and design in between sessions. To me, such a setup would be much more fertile for iterative idea exploration. Broadening the scope of the project (or at least spacing out the structure a little bit) probably has more than a few implications, including specifically for the KB principle of Improvable Ideas: . Of course, all of this is easier said than done! Take for example the fact that many years ago I introduce a somewhat similar project on the development of the Portlands in Toronto (back when Google / Sidewalk Labs was still talking with the city). Since we were in a high school Geography class, the timetable basically dictated that this would be primarily/exclusively a geography assessment. There are stills ways to work within those confines, but sometimes we make the best of what we are given!

Quotes:
- Contributor 13: Hi Contributor 10,
Thank you for the questions.
1. Schools can host online webinars, host online learning platform, or offline forums, etc to sustain the knowledge-building and advancement processes. Take my school for example, we organize regular parent forums (almost monthly) inviting parents to share their experiences or lessons learned from their interactions with their children, inviting psychologists to share knowledge about the physical and mental development characteristics of children of certain age brackets, etc. The school community member's together with the idea diversity brought from their perspectives will advance the state of community knowledge. Some schools have launched parents' learning center to involve them in the knowledge building process, but  as far as I know  -an artefact like Knowledge Forum is put to use to address this issue 2. Well, what schools can try to do is to share the overarching goal of the process is to benefit their children and their involvement is very vital for personal knowledge gains. This shows the importance a platform like KB or human communication.

Label: emphasize real world application
Quotes:
- Contributor 36: Using the school scenario or classroom as a case study to apply sustainable urban design concepts to broader contexts is a valuable approach. By framing the school itself as a 'small city,' students can exercise epistemic agency and bring in their own creative ideas to make the environment more sustainable. Allowing students to redesign their school or even visit and improve another school (I have witnessed in some scenarios this idea take place with older students and have significant results), while aligning with collective responsibility, fosters a real-world application that remains within a controlled environment.
Drawing from my experience in a Jewish school, one sustainability initiative involved turning off electricity for an entire day, encouraging outdoor activities. While collective responsibility was evident, epistemic agency was less emphasized. If we embrace the principle of idea diversity, students could propose even more varied and innovative ways to make their environment sustainable, from smaller changes in their school to potential city-wide applications.
Incorporating local and global contexts would require prompts or frameworks that encourage students to see how their school-based ideas could scale up to influence broader urban design issues. For example, you might ask students: How could your ideas for a sustainable school be applied to public spaces or larger city infrastructure? This could encourage them to think beyond their immediate surroundings while ensuring they remain grounded in real ideas and authentic problems.
Additionally, using peer feedback and integrating community perspectives (like those from local environmental experts or Indigenous knowledge) can enrich the conversation.

However,    is that students are not sure when expectations of a task are being met as the AI continues to provide suggestions for improvement. While this 'snowball effect' is great to support KB, as students in a world with a grading system, we feel it would be hepful to know when we are below, metting, or exceeding expectations. This was previously discussed in Week 2 build-on notes by Contributor 23 and Contributor 36. As an experiment, we tried the generative feedback on the above. Below is the feedback we were given. We noted that suggestion #3 was to provide a soultion. We feel that we already met this expectation as we suggested a flag of being below, meeting, or exceeding expectations. Why is the AI not seeing this as a suggested solution? We then discussed as a group that we have noticed a pattern where the AI provides a suggestion that we feel has already been met.

After receiving feedback, groups refine their designs by integrating new insights, demonstrating   a process where students go beyond initial understandings to develop more sophisticated solutions.  Role-play: Assign one student per group as the advisor who rotates between groups. This student provides guidance based on a shared sustainability framework, ensuring each design supports the city’s overall sustainability goals. Advisors can also collect insights from each group to bring back to their original teams, creating a bridge for idea sharing.

- Contributor 4: Workshops: Schools can host knowledge building information workshops which emphasize the importance of knowledge building. The goal is to raise awareness on what knowledge building is, foster an environement at home where knowledge can be built. Teach parents teaching for learning vs teaching for understanding. Different institutions can also host these workshops where learning is happening for children. 
Applicable to real life situation: challenge in schools in China parents want academic improvement in children, they do not put importance on extracirricular activities. They are not aware of how these activities can help them with holistic growth (another way of knoweldge buikding). Knowledge building is not restricted to school environements, it can happen in various environments where children need to go. 
Sustainability of Workshops: We must make sure the workshops can go on for a long period of time. They should not just end after a short period of time. Ways we can achieve this would be to offer these workshops using different delivery methods (in person, online). It could also be something that is brought up in student/teacher interviews. This is applicable if teachers are also involved in the knowledge building process. It is important that the workshops themselves are presented using knowledge building and not traditional teaching.

   Groups should be able to learn from other groups. If there is an initial presentation of ideas, this would lead to an adoption and adaptation of further growth for other groups. Another way to tackle this would be for a time where students can wander to other groups to see what they have done. A third example could be for groups to send a representative for each part of their city development and all those people to gather and discuss their ideas and then bring it back to their group to gather all the information together. A fourth way would be to not restrict specific roles for discussion but for the different aspects of the city to meet without restriction on how many people. An example would be for all people who want to talk about waste management to go to a designated corner and discuss for 20 minutes. There's endless ways to allow for cross-breeding of ideas and development.  -

We are developing our Knowledge Building community, and are planning to focus on a classroom exploration related to sustainable urban design.  An internet search for educator resources yields a variety of approaches to this big idea, and many of them seem to align with more traditional project-based learning.  An example of a possible design for a classroom STEM project can be found here (Link -> https://www.educationworld.com/a_lesson/Stem-Challenge-Sustainable-City).     facets of Systemic Knowledge Building.  How could this type of project be advanced to align with KB principles and practices?  What would need to shift?  What designs could be put in place to explore sustainable cities in the context of a Knowledge Building Community? My curriculum context is such that I need to make connections to learning about Energy (Grade 5) and Rocks and Minerals (Grade 4), as well as many expectations from the Ontario Language curriculum, and possibly our Social Studies curriculum.  It is also imperative that our learning relate to Indigenous ways of knowing, and our school board is working to ensure that educators implement Indigenous Education throughout all curriculum areas by learning from First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples, communities, nations, and perspectives.
I welcome any ideas about how to approach this topic from a Knowledge Building perspective.  How might our class move forward with this work?

Label: question epistemic agency
Quotes:
- Contributor 19: Hi team. I've been thinking about our idea of an AI-facilitated, morphing assessment chart, and I'm developing some reservations and doubts about it. Of course, we were exploring the idea in the context that we all find ourselves in, but—in the spirit of improvable ideas—here are some concerns that I have, in relation to the principles of Knowledge Building: Reading up on the principles of KB once more, it looks like there is an emphasis not only on the epistemic agency of students charting their own learning course, but also about co-designing the analytics (and, by extension, some of the assessment) of their work. The notion of a rigid achievement chart hidden behind a adaptive lens is perhaps not the most intuitive.
   This second question of mine is perhaps a bit of a perpendicular reading of the KB principle, but I can't help but see a contradiction with the notion of community knowledge being informed by a generalist AI, trained on massive, globally proliferatted data. Would the AI be giving similar advice to students, regardless of their local (cultural, etc.) context? If so, does that take away from the community-level knowledge building?
Anyway, those are some of my thoughts on the matter! I'm sure I'll feel differently after a bit more thought, I was just in a critical mood today, I think!

- Contributor 24: Suggest examples of improvements
The tool can give you some fairly precise critique or suggestions for your work, but it currently does not give you examples of the kinds of improvements it wants. It would be interesting if it was able to do so, and maybe give you a headstart or a point of comparison. Of course, this opens up a whole slew of questions regarding authorship and idea generation.
 
Visibility on back end
The AI tool is not easily understood or interpreted by users in the sense that it makes decisions based on a back-end data set. However, it is difficult right now to trace how our inputs lead to the outputs. Enhancing the interpretability and transparency will help students understand why the output is giving us this feedback, and will probably increase adoption as our trust in the tool leading us in the right direction will increase.
 
Iterative feedback
It would be useful if the AI was able to take into account previous feedback and word/structure its followup feedback against this. For example, it could tell you how many improvements you've addressed or give you some other kind of marker regarding your progress.

Label: propose collective knowledge sharing
Quotes:
- Contributor 15: One idea I have is for everyone to be paired in groups of 2 in the area that they are interested in learning about. They can do an interview style where they ask questions of one another. Then the bigger interest group can get together and each pair shares what they learned from the other person. If this group is big (8-10 people), they can divide into two bigger groups. This way, everyone is able to contribute to the collective knowledge of the whole. They then can take the information of what they heard and spend time bringing it back to their original group (the group they are building the city with) and share some big ideas that they had taken away. There are multiple exit tickets available. One can be that they are prepared to have something they share to their original group.

Label: propose broader context awareness
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: Thanks to your group for all of the great starting points.  I am thinking about many aspects of your ideas.
One part of your contribution that resonated with me relates to this suggestion:
I have worked with students in the past in order to try to develop solutions problems in our local environment and we have had a hard time going beyond designing something to pick up garbage in the school yard.  This is a real issue for us, but I wonder how we can find a balance between imagination and extension and broader world contexts and our own backyard.
Your suggestion does seem to relate to systemic Knowledge Building, in that  
I am wondering what structures in the classroom might best support awareness of broader contexts and problems so that 
I would like to go beyond designing a robot that picks up trash, which is what I have seen students do in the past.  What specific prompts, resources or frameworks do you thnk might best support the integration of local and global contexts, keeping KB principles in mind?

Quotes:
- Contributor 20: Use AI to help our notes get started, if a learner is stuck or coming back after an absence. Incorporating gamification strategies to address/encourage motivation to build on notes. Contributor 37 starts with her experiences from UX/UI, then tries to connect it to education as she's not from an educational background, showing a way to incorporate   in her course 
   Maybe the AI tool could generate ideas before a learner hits 'generative feedback' (thus saving the learner a step?), as you're writing it? Or point you to another note that kind of touches on the same idea, or approaches it from another end?
   the AI tool could show us a categorization of similar/different ideas on the view where we're posting our ideas? the generative feedback gives (sort of) generic advice and no examples or actual prompts to get started? As Marlene mentioned, ChatGPT can't really make deep connections for you, but it doesn't really point in a direction and mostly just points out gaps that the learner was probably already aware of after typing their answer in. -

Further, this could be implemented through . For example, having students go into their community and interviewing community members/ Indigenous elders (if this is an option) in order to gain insights from people who have lived through these experiences.could also be to introduce . This would look like introducing students to . Students could examine articles that are already produced by experts and then challenge and look for 'gaps' that they could work on filling in the expert work. Encouraging students to  will also be useful in other areas of their schooling and beyond school as well. Examining information and literature critically will provide students with the opportunity to be critical about what they are actually using from what they have access to. In order to do this, students could take notes as they read and document any questions they may have, any suggestions that arise and annotate the literature they are examining. This may be more beneficial for older students unless younger students are given simpler texts/articles to annotate. Annotations allow students to record their thoughts and ideas in that moment which is beneficial to Knowledge Building. is also something that could apply in this project because as mentioned by Contributor 25, . I think this is a fantastic idea and it would allow the knowledge and ideas that students develop to become more widespread. Posting the student presentations on an online database so that community members have access to viewing the ideas presented by students could be an effective way to foster new ideas within a community and share knowledge. Students and Parents could join a 'communtiy' and even use a platform like Knowledge Forum where they would be able to build off of the ideas of students and contribute to the collective goal. -

Label: propose global waste reduction inquiry
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: I have been thinking about the question that Contributor 25 suggested posing with students: 
 
   we first asked 'How DO cities all over the world reduce waste?' and have students seek sources to inform about this, including their own parents who come from many different areas of the world, and then use these ideas as a basis for idea improvement?  Better yet, keeping curriculum areas in mind, I wonder if we could ask 'How do cities all over the world reduce non-renewable energy sources?' or 'How do cities all over the world use rocks and minerals?'  These seem like traditional questions related to content knowledge but they could be good catalysts for idea improvement, since students need this basis of knowledge in the first place.  Following the initial questions and interacting with the research they yield, we could ask 'How could they do this better?'What do you think?  Would this align with a KB process or might there be a tweak that could still get at personal relevance (e.g. family experience with international locations) and content knowledge in a different way?

53.
Label: propose interest based teams
Quotes:
- Contributor 37: Interest-based team: Students are grouped by their interest in different sustainable components (e.g., energy, transportation, greenery). This approach encourages students to take ownership of their learning and embodies Democratizing Knowledge, promoting equity and shared responsibility in discussions. Tracking Loop/intergroup session: By presenting designs to other groups, students receive feedback that helps them view their projects from diverse angles, intergroup feedback session encourages students to reflect and iterate on their designs based on shared insights. After receiving feedback, groups refine their designs by integrating new insights, demonstrating   a process where students go beyond initial understandings to develop more sophisticated solutions.  Role-play: Assign one student per group as the advisor who rotates between groups. This student provides guidance based on a shared sustainability framework, ensuring each design supports the city’s overall sustainability goals. Advisors can also collect insights from each group to bring back to their original teams, creating a bridge for idea sharing. Group discussion: Within each group, students discuss and challenge each other’s viewpoints, which encourages the refinement of ideas and deeper understanding through collective dialogue.

Label: describe multicultural classroom
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: I am teaching a Grade 4/5 class in Scarborough, Ontario.  We have a multicultural community of 26 students, with a variety of learning needs as well as many multilingual students.  It is an energetic space and we have many promising ideas!
We are developing our Knowledge Building community, and are planning to focus on a classroom exploration related to sustainable urban design.  An internet search for educator resources yields a variety of approaches to this big idea, and many of them seem to align with more traditional project-based learning.  An example of a possible design for a classroom STEM project can be found here (Link -> https://www.educationworld.com/a_lesson/Stem-Challenge-Sustainable-City).     facets of Systemic Knowledge Building.  How could this type of project be advanced to align with KB principles and practices?  What would need to shift?  What designs could be put in place to explore sustainable cities in the context of a Knowledge Building Community? My curriculum context is such that I need to make connections to learning about Energy (Grade 5) and Rocks and Minerals (Grade 4), as well as many expectations from the Ontario Language curriculum, and possibly our Social Studies curriculum.  It is also imperative that our learning relate to Indigenous ways of knowing, and our school board is working to ensure that educators implement Indigenous Education throughout all curriculum areas by learning from First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples, communities, nations, and perspectives.
I welcome any ideas about how to approach this topic from a Knowledge Building perspective.  How might our class move forward with this work?

Label: create safe learning environments
Quotes:
- Contributor 2: Main problem: students are having a hard time staying engaged and have trouble finding motivation to complete and interact with the course content.
Solutions
1. Part of my research for the MT program at OISE looks at increasing student motivation and engagement specifically in Physical Education classes via the use of music integration. I believe that by using music in the class while facilitating games or exercises for your students can greatly increase their motivation and make the class more fun. This increases their engagement especially if they are listening to music that they like. Think of it like going to the gym to workout most people go to workout and listen to music at the same time.
2. Another way to improve student engagement and motivation would be to incorporate gamified learning. Students can begin to learn by playing games that aim to touch on the learning goal for that period. Students can be offered points or rewards for adopting sustainable behaviours or solving problems. This can foster friendly and healthy competition and promote fun in learning new things
3. Another method to increase student engagement is through relationship building. Teachers need to actively try to engage with students and make efforts to get to know them so that they know how to best guide each student on their learning journey. Taking the time to get to know students is acccessible and sustainable to all and goes a long way :)
We also think that this problem relates to this facet . This is because we believe that one of the key factors to improving student engagement and motivation is to build strong relationships with students and safe classroom environments. This will help students feel comfortable in their learning environment and more welcome in the classroom.

I'll take this opportunity to make a brief aside about the potential benefits for teachers to think along the lines of KB... it certainly seems like it would be a bit revitalizing and a nice change of pace! Of course, it's easier to assume things going well than things not going well. I would imagine some growing pains, but again, it's exciting just to hear your ideas on how students could be zipping around!

I love that idea!    Thinking of the entire class as a sustainable city where each group represents a community really brings a sense of interconnectedness to the project. It would also give students the opportunity to see how their individual efforts contribute to the bigger picture of sustainability. By having each group focus on a specific topic and engage in research and fieldwork, we could ensure that every student has a role in improving both their 'neighbourhood' and the overall sustainability of the class-city.

Label: emphasize indigenous perspectives
Quotes:
- Contributor 31: Hi everyone,
This weekend I met the Indigenous artist Travis Shilling while visiting a friend in Orillia.  His father was Arthur Shilling, another prominent Indigenous artist.  It was an inspiring meeting, as I learned about a project that Travis has been working on in the Orillia area.  He has designed stainless steel easels that are set up at six different sites.   They are both sculptures and invitations to engage with the land through artistry.  You can read about Travis Shilling and see images of the easels at the website 'Sacred Site Easels (Link -> https://www.sacredsiteeasels.com/)'.
Travis passed along a couple of documents that also represent the project and I have attached images of those to this post.
I would really like to engage students with Travis' work, and hope that the Sacred Site Easels would inspire idea work, and take us deeper with respect to the idea of Indigenous relationships with the land, and potential innovation around that.
I welcome any ideas with respect to how to integrate this art initiative within our KB community.  I also wonder if it might inspire other ideas related to how to bring Indigenous perspectives into our work.

Label: emphasize community knowledge
Quotes:
- Contributor 13: Hi Contributor 10,
Thank you for the questions.
1. Schools can host online webinars, host online learning platform, or offline forums, etc to sustain the knowledge-building and advancement processes. Take my school for example, we organize regular parent forums (almost monthly) inviting parents to share their experiences or lessons learned from their interactions with their children, inviting psychologists to share knowledge about the physical and mental development characteristics of children of certain age brackets, etc. The school community member's together with the idea diversity brought from their perspectives will advance the state of community knowledge. Some schools have launched parents' learning center to involve them in the knowledge building process, but  as far as I know  -an artefact like Knowledge Forum is put to use to address this issue 2. Well, what schools can try to do is to share the overarching goal of the process is to benefit their children and their involvement is very vital for personal knowledge gains. This shows the importance a platform like KB or human communication.

Label: explore solar powered learning kits
Quotes:
- Contributor 12: The disparity in education between developing and developed countries. I agree that creating an online learning platform could help bridge this gap, offering both professional development for teachers and resources for students. However, I also understand Contributor 8's concern about accessibility and the motives behind technology sources. Governments in some countries might be wary of adopting foreign technology for cultural or political reasons. To truly promote equitable education globally, we need a collaborative approach where educational platforms are designed with input from local educators, respecting cultural differences. It’s not just about providing resources but also ensuring that they are accessible, relevant, and inclusive. Beyond online platforms, we should explore ways to address infrastructure issues in developing countries, such as limited internet access, by incorporating offline solutions or community-based initiatives. I'm thinking of Solar-powered Learning Kits. In areas where electricity is scarce, solar-powered educational kits can provide a sustainable way to access digital learning resources. These kits can include devices like solar-powered tablets with pre-installed educational content. Or focus on traditional media like radio and television to broadcast educational programs. This approach has been used successfully in various countries to reach students in remote areas. -

Label: suggest algorithm for distribution
Quotes:
- Contributor 11: To build on this group's discussions, it is imperitive to address the condition in which the groups are formed. I like how this group identified as a path to move forward by grouping students . One way to extend this, would be to provide students with an opportunity to explore each topic before deciding on a group to ensure that they make an informed decision.    is that some students may choose a topic based on a friend's choice in order to work together.    having students submit their group choice privately, by having each student write down their group choice on paper and hand it to their teacher.  I believe that this should support    as students interact with each other in new ways, or interact with students they have not worked with before as . the division of topics, what if some groups are larger than others, what is some topics are not selected by any students.    students rank their topic choices and an algorithm develops the groups to ensure an even distruibution of students between the topics, while considering the student preferences?

Label: emphasize societal harm
Quotes:
- Contributor 19: Hi folks. Just wanted to make a quick note on how interesting I think your definition of (lack of) sustainability is: 
I would imagine most people would associate the term sustainability first-and-foremost (and perhaps exclusively) with the environment. I might have a bit of a bias here given my background in Biology, but I would say that's also the case in my other background: Political Science.
I find it interesting not only that you include the idea of avoiding harm to society, but also that you put it first. I feel like we can run with that analogy/comparison even further. Like the environment, there will still be an environment left no matter how poorly we manage the globe, it might just be a polluted, toxic wasteland. Similarly, there will certainly be society in the future, but we may do lasting harm to it if we are not careful.
Sorry I'm not building on your designs, but I thought that was fascinating! Thanks for that!

You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. If a sub-code includes another, use the broader one. If sub-codes are parallel, write one that covers both.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1. user feedback, response to user feedback.
- Instances where users provide feedback or suggestions about the software.
- Direct suggestions or comments from users that influence software design or updates.
- Designer's reactions and adjustments based on user feedback.

2. feature request, feature requests and feedback.
- Instances where users request specific features or improvements to the software.
- Instances where users express desires for new features or modifications to existing features.
- Suggestions or requests by users for specific features to be added or improved in the software.
- Discussions or requests by users for specific features or feedback on the software.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Relationship: The sub-codes are inclusive, with "response to user feedback" being a broader concept that encompasses "user feedback."
Criteria: Instances where users provide feedback, suggestions, or comments that directly influence software design, updates, or modifications, including the designers' reactions and adjustments to such feedback.
Label: User Feedback and Response
Category: Design Modification Inputs

2.
Relationship: The sub-codes are redundant as they all describe the same phenomenon from slightly different angles.
Criteria: Instances where users explicitly request new features or improvements to existing features, including suggestions for specific additions or modifications, and discussions about these features.

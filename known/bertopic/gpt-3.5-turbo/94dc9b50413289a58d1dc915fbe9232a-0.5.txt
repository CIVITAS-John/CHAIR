You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input messages. Each is independent from another. Do not over-interpret the data.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

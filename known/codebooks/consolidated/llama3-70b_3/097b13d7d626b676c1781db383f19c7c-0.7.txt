You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: ? maybe again self rebut on the previous self rebut?
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

2.
Label: give a timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

3.
Label: make a suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

4.
Label: seeking download information
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- User: How to download?

5.
Label: acknowledging that the on screen keyboard may not be accessible without touching the input field
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

6.
Label: warning about potential issues
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

7.
Label: building anticipation
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

8.
Label: proposing specific physics simulation and demonstration features
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

9.
Label: confirming design direction
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay.

10.
Label: further explaining the bidirectional conversion feature and its benefits for problem solving
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

11.
Label: emphasize optimization
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

12.
Label: designer 2 mentions group sharing feature
Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

13.
Label: balancing transparency with managing expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

14.
Label: guides users on accessing specific platform features
Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

15.
Label: story sharing
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

16.
Label: confirmation
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.
- Designer: Hmm hmm.
- Designer: ðŸ˜‚

17.
Label: describing plans for a simulated experiment assessment feature
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

18.
Label: name a specific person
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

19.
Label: announcement of plans
Quotes:

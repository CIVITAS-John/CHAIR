You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: share visual reference
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

2.
Label: reinforce responsiveness to community feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

3.
Label: explained project timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

4.
Label: designer 1 provides simulation options
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

5.
Label: express appreciation for shared resources
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

6.
Label: encourage transparency in project progress
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

7.
Label: acknowledge common practices
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

8.
Label: emphasize the need for adaptive design
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

9.
Label: designer 1 sets timeline for update
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

10.
Label: explain complexity
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

11.
Label: set timeline for update
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

12.
Label: followup
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- User: Win7 should be fine.

13.
Label: compare user experiences
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

14.
Label: humanize the designer's role
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

15.
Label: clarified feature
Quotes:

Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

17.
Label: provide reassurance about compatibility
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

18.
Label: acknowledge future plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

19.
Label: reinforce positive community sentiment
Quotes:
- User: It's already starting to take shape [Emoji]
- User: Oh, this is nice

20.
Label: articulate detailed needs for physics demonstrations
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

21.
Label: contribute to collaborative atmosphere
Quotes:
- User: Indeed

22.
Label: clarified platform requirements
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

23.
Label: enhance user experience with clarity
Quotes:
- Designer: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch

24.
Label: encourage feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

25.
Label: feature discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

26.
Label: advocate for user driven design
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

27.
Label: user 4232 praises idea
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

28.
Label: guide user expectations
Quotes:

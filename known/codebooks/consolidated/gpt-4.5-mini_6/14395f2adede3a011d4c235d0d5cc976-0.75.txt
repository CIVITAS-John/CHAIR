You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: acknowledges limitations in debugging, recognizes limitations in ai and human capabilities
- Users acknowledge the limitations of AI in debugging, despite improvements in its troubleshooting capabilities.
- The user acknowledges the limitations of AI and inherent human fallibility in coding tasks.

2.
Concepts: promotes collaborative programming with ai, advocate for ai in learning and knowledge preservation
- The interviewee advocates for collaborative programming practices and AI's role in enhancing programming efficiency.
- Users advocate for AI's role in preserving knowledge and improving learning efficiency in collaborative programming environments.

3.
Concepts: appreciates timely feedback from ai, optimize workflow through ai feedback
- The user appreciates prompt responses and feedback from AI to enhance coding efficiency.
- Users improve their coding workflow by adapting their practices based on feedback provided by AI.

4.
Concepts: reference ai-generated code without copying, employ ai-generated code in practice
- Users prefer to reference AI-generated code rather than copying it directly into their work.
- Users employ AI to generate code and make deliberate decisions to copy and paste the AI-generated code for their implementation.

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. 
Concepts: acknowledges limitations in debugging, recognizes limitations in ai and human capabilities
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected as users recognize both the limitations of AI in debugging and their own human limitations in coding, indicating an understanding of the constraints in the learning process.
Criteria: Users recognize the restrictions of AI's debugging abilities and their own fallibility in coding tasks.
Phrase: Acknowledge limitations in debugging

2.
Concepts: promotes collaborative programming with ai, advocate for ai in learning and knowledge preservation
Relationship: These concepts are related as they both emphasize the importance of collaboration between users and AI, highlighting how AI can enhance programming practices and contribute to knowledge retention in collaborative environments.
Criteria: Users advocate for the use of AI to foster collaborative programming and enhance learning and knowledge preservation.
Phrase: Advocate for collaborative programming with AI

3.
Concepts: appreciates timely feedback from ai, optimize workflow through ai feedback
Relationship: These concepts are logically linked as users value the quick responses from AI, which they utilize to refine and enhance their coding practices, thereby optimizing their workflow.
Criteria: Users value prompt AI feedback and use it to streamline their coding processes.
Phrase: Optimize workflow through AI feedback

4. 
Concepts: reference ai-generated code without copying, employ ai-generated code in practice
Relationship: The relationship here indicates that users prefer to utilize AI-generated code as a reference point rather than directly copying it, which shows a deliberate choice in how they integrate AI contributions into their work.
Criteria: Users reference AI-generated code and make informed decisions to implement it in their coding practice.
Phrase: Reference AI-generated code in practice

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
Keywords: designer, magnetism, electrical, electromagnetism, mechanics

Thought: The common theme among these quotes seems to be the designers discussing and prioritizing the different content areas or topics to cover in the Physics Lab, with a focus on electromagnetism-related topics like electricity, magnetism, and circuits before moving on to mechanics.
Label: Curriculum planning and content prioritization

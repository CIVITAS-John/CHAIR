You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: informs users about the testing phase of a circuit diagram version and advises on manual adjustments due to algorithm limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

2.
Label: the designers are transparent about their development process
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

3.
Label: sharing updates
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

4.
Label: consult on educational standards
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5.
Label: concurring on design ideas
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

6.
Label: providing user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

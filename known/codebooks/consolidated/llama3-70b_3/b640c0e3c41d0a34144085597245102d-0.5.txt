You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?

1.
Label: emphasize the need for efficient learning strategies
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the, one of the things which I have observed, as I'm bouncing from like, because I do a lot of different languages and potentially, so I don't have that much time to spend in anyone. (interviewer's observation) As an expert, E01 knows many languages but does not have much time for each one.

2.
Label: uses ai for specific code adjustments
Quotes:
- E04: "Can train-perceptron be turned into a reporter" (interviewer's observation) E04 uses "can you fix with my own idea".

3.
Label: appreciates user friendly interactions
Quotes:
- E04: I thought it was really cool that, you know, that it knew exactly what I wanted to do and then kind of allowed me to define like the certain parameters for what I wanted to do. (interviewer's observation) Having the interface to clarify parameters helps.

4.
Label: uses ai code when pressed for time

- E04: Because I'll like forget the syntax sometimes and I usually use the netlogo dictionary and just have it like open to the side. (interviewer's observation) E04 still forgets about the syntax and ChatGPT can help.

6.
Label: emphasizes customized documentation
Quotes:
- E01: And you want doctors to use it, nurses to use it and medical transcriptionists to use it. They use a different word for whatever the verb for whatever it is you're saying you want them to do. And so, in some sense, their documentation has to be customized to their context to their user group. ... It's a language system. If you have a learning system that's actually capable of harvesting information, yeah, and a lot of them are not yet, but I think we'll get there. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to translate jargons between different sub-groups working in the same systems and ease the cost of writing customized documentation.

12.
Label: describes hive mind system
Quotes:
- E01: I call it hive feedback system, where if anyone in the world learns a new fact, or like, Oh, if you're a nurse, here's the word. If you're a transcriptionist, here's the word. If anybody learns it, then it goes into the system into the cloud. And now the cloud won't make that mistake anymore.

16.
Label: notes unpredictability in generated results
Quotes:
- E04: Sometimes it'll give me instructions and sometimes it'll just give me the code and then sometimes it'll tell me to use R extensions or something like that.

17.
Label: reflect on cost implications

26.
Label: struggles with outdated functionality
Quotes:
- E04: I guess, in their databases, they still have like, NetLogo 5 in there and stuff. So like, for example, you know, the anonymous functions, they still use like, the old, sometimes I'll get like, the old functionality for the anonymous functions.

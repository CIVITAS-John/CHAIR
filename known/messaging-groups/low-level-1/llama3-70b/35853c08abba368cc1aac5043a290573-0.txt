Summary of previous conversation: The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab's online community, where designers and users interact, sharing resources, providing feedback, and discussing feature updates. The conversation is characterized by a sense of community, with users expressing gratitude and designers responding to feedback and inquiries.
1. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
2. User-4232: Indeed
3. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
4. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
5. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
6. User-4232: This idea is really good
7. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
8. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
9. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
10. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

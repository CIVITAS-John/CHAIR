You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
Upon reviewing the draft merging plan, I noticed that:

* The category "Social Context" might be too broad and could be split into "Social Environment" and "Community Dynamics" if more nuanced differences emerge in the data.
* "Design and Development" is a large category that might be further divided into "Design Principles" and "Technical Considerations" if more specific themes emerge.
* "Communication Strategies" could be split into "Digital Communication" and "Technical Communication" if the data suggests distinct approaches.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1

- "Example quote 2"

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

* Summary
In this brief exchange, a designer and a participant (P4229) discuss uploading a high-definition version of an avatar image. The designer asks P4229 if they are a teacher, to which P4229 confirms. Another participant, P8, shares an image.

* Plan
To analyze this interaction, we should examine the roles and contributions of different participants, the use of technology in communication, and the collaborative efforts in the design and sharing of resources. Key questions include: How do roles (e.g., teacher, designer) influence the dynamics of the conversation? What technological affordances are being utilized or discussed? How does the interaction reflect principles of participatory design?

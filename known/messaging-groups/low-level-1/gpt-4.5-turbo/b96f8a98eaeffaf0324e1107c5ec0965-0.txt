Thoughts: The conversation appears to be centered around the use of the term "+1" in an online Physics Lab group. The goal is to analyze how participants interact and communicate agreement or shared opinions, and how they assist each other in understanding group norms or jargon. This will help in understanding the emergence of social interactions within the group.

Analysis for all 9 messages:
1. exclusion
2. agreement

7. clarification
8. hesitation
9. suggestion

Summary: The conversation starts with P14 feeling excluded or different, followed by several members expressing their agreement or shared opinion using "+1". P10, possibly newer to the group or less familiar with the jargon, inquires about the meaning of "+1". P11 and P13 provide clarification. P13's subsequent messages show a moment of hesitation followed by a suggestion to use an external resource for further information. This sequence of interactions reflects a typical pattern of how community norms are shared and how members support each other in understanding these norms.

Notes: The use of "+1" as a simple tool for agreement is prevalent in many online communities, indicating a quick and efficient way to express consensus without lengthy responses. The interaction also highlights the role of community members in educating each other about the norms and language used within the group. P13's suggestion to use Baidu for more information also points to the integration of external resources in community interactions, which can be a common practice in online communities to foster self-reliance among members. This conversation is a microcosm of how community culture and norms are transmitted and maintained among members.

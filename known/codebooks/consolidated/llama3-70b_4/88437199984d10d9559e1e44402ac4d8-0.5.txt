You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: appreciate ai's efficiency, valuing convenience and efficiency in ai-assisted work
- Participants acknowledge AI's efficiency and appreciate the time-saving benefits it provides.
- Participants value convenience and efficiency in AI-assisted learning and work, and prefer AI solutions over prolonged problem-solving and value time-saving.

2.
Concepts: recognizing ai's potential in education, recognizing ai's time-saving potential
- Users recognize the potential of AI to improve the learning process and make it more efficient, and recognize the potential of AI in educational settings.
- Participants recognize AI's potential in reducing the learning curve and saving time for learning new extensions or concepts, particularly for time-constrained learners, and suggest that AI could save time for learning new extensions or concepts.

3.
Concepts: struggle with the current design, struggle with outdated functionality
- Participants struggle with the current design and find it challenging.
- Participants struggle with outdated NetLogo functionality.

4.
Concepts: debug ai-generated code, reasoning through ai responses
- Participants debug AI-generated code using critical thinking.
- Participants reason through AI responses, understanding and debugging code logic, trying to understand the thought process behind AI's responses.

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* Interaction design
* User interaction
=> User experience

* Design features
* Design feedback
=> Design aspects

* Laboratory activities
* Science conversations
* Scientific knowledge
=> Science learning

* Learning engagement
* Learning support
=> Learning experience

* Communication approach
* Social interaction
=> Community interaction

* Data input
* Technology assistance
=> Technical support

# Reflection
- More categories for merging could be identified, such as merging "technology concepts" with "technological progress" or merging "hardware demands" with "technology assistance."
- The categories seem appropriately merged without over-merging or creating overly broad categories.
- The naming of the merged categories accurately reflects the aspects covered within them.

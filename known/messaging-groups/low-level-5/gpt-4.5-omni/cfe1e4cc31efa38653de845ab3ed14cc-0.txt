You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. User-4232: Thank you.
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 expresses gratitude; user 4232 acknowledges support; user 4232 concludes interaction
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
Preliminary phrases: designer 2 offers ongoing support; designer 2 encourages problem reporting; designer 2 fosters open communication
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
Preliminary phrases: user 4232 praises software; user 4232 compares with other software; user 4232 highlights practicality
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 considers future compatibility; designer 1 suggests potential solution; designer 1 acknowledges user feedback
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 theorizes compatibility; designer 1 sets hardware expectations; designer 1 provides technical insight
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
Preliminary phrases: designer 1 announces new version; designer 1 informs about update availability; designer 1 engages community with release notes
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

Thoughts: In this round of coding, I will focus on identifying the actions, contexts, and intents behind each statement. I will consider how the interactions contribute to the emergence of the online community, the role of participatory design, and the dynamics of human-computer interaction. Key questions include: How do users and designers communicate needs and solutions? How do designers respond to user feedback? How does the community foster a collaborative environment?

Summary: The conversation reveals a dynamic and collaborative online community where users and designers actively engage in dialogue to improve the Physics Lab software. User-4232 expresses gratitude and provides positive feedback, highlighting the software's practicality compared to other tools. Designer-1 and Designer-2 respond to user feedback by considering compatibility issues, announcing updates, and addressing usability concerns. The designers demonstrate a commitment to ongoing support and iterative improvement, fostering an open and supportive environment. User-4232 suggests new features and provides context for their needs, which the designers acknowledge and plan to implement. The conversation also touches on technical challenges and workarounds, reflecting a shared problem-solving approach.

Notes: The interaction between users and designers is characterized by mutual respect and a focus on practical solutions. The designers' responsiveness to user feedback and their willingness to discuss technical details contribute to a sense of community and shared purpose. The conversation highlights the importance of participatory design in creating user-centered software and the role of human-computer interaction in addressing usability issues. The anecdote about the lack of internet access in classrooms underscores the real-world constraints that users face, which the designers take into account when planning updates.

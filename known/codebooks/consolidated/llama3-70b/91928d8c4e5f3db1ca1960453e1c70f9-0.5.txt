You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: learning curve
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they all describe difficulties or challenges users face when initially interacting with the AI system, which contribute to the learning curve.
Criteria: Participants experience difficulties or challenges when using the AI system due to design limitations or lack of intuitiveness, leading to a learning curve.
Phrase: Encounter difficulties in understanding or using the system.

2.
Concepts: experiencing initial confusion
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants are unclear or uncertain about the capabilities of the AI system when they first start using it.
Phrase: Express initial uncertainty about system capabilities.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, actors, and intents with codes and be specific.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (5 in total):
1. code 1; code 2...
...
5. code 3; code 4...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation starts with Designer-2 sharing an image (Image 2-0). The context and purpose of the image are unclear.
1. Designer-2: [Image 2-0]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
2. Designer-1: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. User-4229: PC version?
4. Designer-1: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. User-4229: Yes.

Thoughts: In this round of coding, I'll focus on understanding the initial interactions between the designers and users in the Physics Lab online community. I'll explore how the designers' actions and responses set the tone for the community's emergence. I'll consider the role of image sharing, technical discussions, and the introduction of personal identities. Guiding questions include: What is the significance of the initial image shared by Designer-2? How do the designers respond to user inquiries, and what does this reveal about their intentions?

Codes for each message:
1. Image 2-0; sharing visual content; unclear context
2. @mention; technical inquiry; avatar customization
3. Platform inquiry; PC version suggestion
4. Uploading content; user role inquiry; teacher assumption
5. Affirmation; teacher identity

Summary: The conversation begins with Designer-2 sharing an image without context, prompting Designer-1 to respond to User-4229's technical inquiry about uploading high-definition avatars. The discussion shifts to User-4229's role as a teacher, with Designer-1 offering to upload content and inquiring about the user's profession.

Notes: The designers seem to be experimenting with image sharing and responding to user inquiries, potentially setting the stage for community engagement. The introduction of User-4229's role as a teacher may indicate the community's focus on education. I hypothesize that the designers are testing the platform's features and establishing a rapport with users, which may influence the community's development.

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

* Summary
The conversation revolves around the users' requests for new features in Physics Lab and the designers' responses to these requests. User-4230 asks for dynamic demonstrations of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, as well as optical experiments. Designer-1 responds by explaining their current priorities and promising to gather opinions before starting mechanics. User-4231 asks for the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab and receives a link to the download. Designer-1 also mentions an upcoming update that will change the way dry batteries are used in the program.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from multiple theoretical angles, we will create a codebook that includes codes related to learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. We will look for evidence of how the users are learning and engaging with the Physics Lab platform, how they are interacting with the designers and other users, and how they are contributing to the design and development of the platform.

# Learning Sciences
## Active Learning
Definition: Users are actively engaged in the learning process by making requests for new features and providing feedback to the designers.
- "First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference?"
- "Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work."

## Scaffolding
Definition: The designers provide support and guidance to the users to help them learn and use the Physics Lab platform.
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything."

# Human-Computer Interaction
## User Experience
Definition: The designers are concerned with creating a positive user experience by prioritizing features and providing clear instructions.
- "Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts."
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate). The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component."

## Accessibility
Definition: The designers are making the Physics Lab platform accessible to users by providing a PC/interactive whiteboard version.
- "[Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?"

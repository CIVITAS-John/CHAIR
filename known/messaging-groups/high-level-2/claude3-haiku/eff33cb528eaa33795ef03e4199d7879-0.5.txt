Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary

1. P1: Tsk tsk tsk
2. P2: Hello
3. Designer: hello
4. Designer: There will be more people here once the official version is released.
5. Designer: Probably because the teacher finds too much talking annoying ðŸ˜‚
6. P1: hello
7. P4: [Image 1-6]
8. P5: ðŸ˜‚ By the way, I'm here to see if there are any good designs to reference.
9. Designer: Good design?
10. P6: For example, a microcomputer.

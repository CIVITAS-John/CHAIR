You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* technical feedback systems
* technical communication
=> technical interaction and feedback

* digital interaction
* technology and tools
=> digital tools and interaction

* knowledge exchange processes
* learning and reflection
=> knowledge and learning processes

* participatory design influence
* project development
=> participatory project development

# Reflection
- **More categories for merging:** The "social identity" category could potentially be merged with "online community engagement" to emphasize the role of identity in community participation.
- **Over-merged categories:** The merge of "technical feedback systems" and "technical communication" into "technical interaction and feedback" seems appropriate as both deal with technical aspects of communication and feedback. No split seems necessary here.
- **Naming inaccuracies:** The names chosen seem to reflect the combined aspects of each category appropriately. However, "digital tools and interaction" could be more specific to reflect its role in the Physics Lab's online community.

Considering the reflection, here's the final merging plan:

# Final Merging
* technical feedback systems
* technical communication
=> technical interaction and feedback

* digital interaction
* technology and tools
=> digital tools and interaction

* knowledge exchange processes
* learning and reflection
=> knowledge and learning processes

* participatory design influence
* project development
=> participatory project development

* social identity
* online community engagement
=> community identity and engagement

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation started with a user (P13) providing guidance to the community about searching on Baidu, which was acknowledged by another user (P10). The discussion then shifted to topics related to the Physics Lab community, such as community participation, discussions about various aspects of the lab (e.g., things in the beaker, astronomy, software), and reactions to shared images. The participants seemed to take on different roles, with some providing guidance, others engaging in discussions, and some reacting to the content.
1. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
Preliminary tags: community context
2. P11: Look it up online, this is not something that can be solved in a few words. @P2 
Preliminary tags: community guidance
3. P2: Can we add a motor? @Designer 
Preliminary tags: community suggestion
4. P14: I think I should focus on doing mathematics.
5. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
6. Designer: We will be relatively simple, practical (close to the exam), and affordable.
7. P11: 2333
8. P11: Ask the group owner.
9. Designer: After all, it's not specifically about astronomy.
10. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
11. P2: [Image 144]
12. P2: From what I know currently.
13. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in the Physics Lab?
14. Designer: Motor simulation is more complicated, and it depends on the load.
15. Designer: Calculated it...
16. P2: How was it calculated?
17. P11: Okay.
18. P11: Because of the rectifier last time, I mistakenly thought it had a preset model.
19. P11: [Image 152]
20. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but an atomized model.
21. Designer: Pursuing accuracy, the phone can't handle it.
22. P1: Server?
23. P11: Hahaha
24. Designer: Standalone.
25. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
26. Designer: Two types of motors.
27. P1: Are you going to the server?
28. P2: Brushed motor.
29. P2: It's not a brushless motor that connects to AC.
30. P14: Finally, we're talking about something I can understand.
31. P2: You don't understand brushless motors.
32. P2: It's difficult to make it work.
33. P4: If you make an electric motor, it's quite simple using the method I mentioned. @Designer 
34. P14: [Image 168]
35. P2: Has it been burned?

Thoughts: The conversation has shifted from general community guidance to more technical discussions about the Physics Lab project, including specific features like motors, software, and experimental results. The participants seem to take on different roles, with some providing suggestions and guidance, while others are more focused on understanding the technical aspects. The Designer seems to play a key role in providing explanations and clarifications. There are also some reactions and casual exchanges between the participants. To analyze the emergence of the community, it will be important to identify the different types of interactions, the roles of the participants, and how the discussion evolves over time.

Summary: The conversation started with a user (P13) providing guidance to the community about searching on Baidu, which was acknowledged by another user (P10). The discussion then shifted to topics related to the Physics Lab community, such as community participation, discussions about various aspects of the lab (e.g., things in the beaker, astronomy, software), and reactions to shared images. 

The conversation has now focused on more technical discussions about the Physics Lab project, including specific features like motors, software, and experimental results. Participants take on different roles, with some providing suggestions and guidance, while others are more focused on understanding the technical aspects. The Designer seems to play a key role in providing explanations and clarifications.

The discussion covers topics such as the project goals (practical and affordable), the scope (not specifically about astronomy), the technical challenges (motor simulation, accuracy, phone limitations), and the different types of motors (brushed, brushless). There are also some casual exchanges and reactions to shared images.

Notes: The conversation suggests that the Physics Lab community is actively engaged in technical discussions and problem-solving related to the project. The participants seem to have different levels of understanding and expertise, with some taking on more of a guidance role, while others are more focused on learning and understanding the technical details. The Designer appears to be an important figure in providing explanations and clarifications. The discussion also suggests that the community is evolving, with participants taking on different roles and the conversation shifting between more general and more technical topics.

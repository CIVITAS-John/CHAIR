1. Designer: I tried it in junior high last time. Now there is a clever way to click on the link button in the upper right corner, pop up the browser, and it won't be full screen anymore... = =
2. P4232: @Designer Yes, that's right.
3. P4232: It would be convenient to have an export function, or save and import experiments. We can set the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
4. Designer: It will be available.
5. Designer: Is there a network in the classroom?
6. P4232: Generally not, since one time during a city-level public class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
7. Designer: 2333333333
8. Designer: Looks like we need to support local export now.
9. P4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid software downloads that may slow down the computers.
10. Designer: Mm-hmm.
11. P4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were all amazed.
12. Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. P4232: I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available on the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
15. Designer: Sorry for the midnight crowing :)
16. P4233: How to download?
17. P4233: May I ask?
18. P8: Group sharing.

Summary: The conversation revolves around the development and use of a physics simulation software called "Physics Lab". The participants discuss various features of the software, such as the ability to export and import experiments, and the need for a local export function due to network restrictions in classrooms. The teacher, P4232, shares their positive experience using the software in the classroom, noting that the students were engaged and amazed by the simulation. The developer, Designer, responds to the feedback and provides updates on the software's availability. The conversation also touches on the challenges faced by teachers in managing the classroom environment, such as network restrictions and the need to prevent unwanted content from appearing.

Notes: The conversation demonstrates a collaborative and supportive relationship between the developer and the teacher. They discuss the software's features and the teacher's experiences in the classroom, indicating a mutual interest in improving the software to better suit the needs of educators. The conversation also highlights the importance of considering the classroom environment and the challenges teachers face in managing technology in the classroom.

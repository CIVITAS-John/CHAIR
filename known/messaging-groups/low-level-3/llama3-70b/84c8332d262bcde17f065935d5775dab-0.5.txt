You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. P4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary tags: polite expression; apology; social norms
2. P8: Shared in the group.
Preliminary tags: sharing; community engagement; group sharing; social interaction
3. Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
Preliminary tags: technical support; download instructions; resource sharing
4. Designer: We will also update the multimeter and energized screwdriver this week. If there are any features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group. We will try our best to consider them. Saving experiments to the cloud/local storage, as mentioned before, is also in the plan. Thank you all!
Preliminary tags: design update; feature development; community involvement; participatory design; feedback solicitation
5. P4234: [Emoji 56]
Preliminary tags: emoji
6. P4232: [Emoji 57][Emoji 57]
Preliminary tags: emotional expression; playfulness; social bonding
7. P4235: Hello everyone
8. Designer: Hello :)
9. P4234: Are there any other updates recently?
10. Designer: [Image 61] Preparing for an update
11. Designer: This one is more complicated, so it will take a bit more time... Hopefully it will be ready for release this week
12. Designer: There will be: multimeter; energized solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem solving and middle school teaching)
13. P4235: Is there a user manual?
14. Designer: Have you encountered any problems while using it?
15. Designer: We try to design it to be usable without the need for additional instructions, or we will provide some tips when you open it for the first time based on feedback
16. P4235: Mainly for schools to build information technology schools
17. P4235: Need the user manual for this software
18. Designer: Oh, I see, could you briefly tell me what you need?
19. P4232: That's great, I hope it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no software that is convenient for drawing circuit diagrams for the circuit part of the exam
20. Designer: Actually, we are researching bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
21. Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later
22. P4235: You can also include mechanics experiments
23. Designer: For example, after connecting the physical diagram, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram, or vice versa
24. Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics are sorted out; it will take some time
25. P4232: Oh, that's good
26. Designer: I hope to figure out electromagnetics before the end of the year
27. P4235: The 3D effect of your software is very good
28. Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do exercises in the application
29. P4234: It's starting to take shape [Emoji 80]
30. Designer: For example, connecting the physical diagram to see the circuit diagram, or vice versa
31. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
32. Designer: Hmm.

Thoughts: 
In this conversation, I plan to explore the emergence of the online community around Physics Lab through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I'll examine how the designer engages with the community, solicits feedback, and incorporates user suggestions into the design process. I'll also investigate how users interact with each other and the designer, and how they contribute to the development of Physics Lab.

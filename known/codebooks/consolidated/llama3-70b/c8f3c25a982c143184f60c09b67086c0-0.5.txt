You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: feature announcements, software update announcements
- A designer announces new features or updates to the app's features.
- Announcing updates or changes to the app, or a designer announces a new version or update of the Physics Lab software.

2.
Concepts: interface limitations, limitation explanations
- Explaining limitations or constraints of the current software interface, and providing context for software design constraints, such as explaining technical limitations.
- A designer explains why a limitation or issue can be addressed or overcome, or a designer explains why a problem cannot be solved due to system limitations, or explains technical limitations or constraints that affect the software or its use.

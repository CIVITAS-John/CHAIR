You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: explain complexity
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

2.
Label: engaging with designer
Quotes:
- User: PC version?
- User: Yes.

3.
Label: acknowledging the need for manual editing and the timeline for implementation
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

4.
Label: teacher-admin interaction
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5.
Label: detailing plans for advanced features
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

6.
Label: offering insight into prevailing practices
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

7.
Label: sharing version information
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

8.
Label: highlighting security concerns in educational settings
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

9.
Label: elaboration
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

10.
Label: suggesting future developments based on user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

11.
Label: balance user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

12.
Label: indicating the possibility of future demonstration experiments
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

13.
Label: balancing automatic and manual features
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

14.
Label: talk about limitation of the solution
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

15.
Label: addressing compatibility issues
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

16.
Label: suggests adding export/import function for convenience in educational settings
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

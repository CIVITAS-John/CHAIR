You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: system feedback, critique unclear error messaging
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as users’ critiques of unclear error messaging stem from their experiences with the system's feedback, indicating a direct correlation between the feedback quality and user satisfaction.
Criteria: Users identified issues with system feedback, specifically criticizing the clarity of error messages and suggesting improvements for better understanding and resolution.
Phrase: Critique unclear error messaging

2. 
Concepts: successful implementation, express satisfaction with ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are logically connected as users’ satisfaction with AI-generated code arises from their successful implementation experiences, highlighting a positive outcome from the interaction with AI.
Criteria: Users reported successful implementations of AI-generated code and expressed their satisfaction with its effectiveness in accomplishing their tasks.
Phrase: Express satisfaction with AI-generated code

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: preferring ai solutions, valuing ai's intuition and creative problem-solving
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the appreciation for AI's capabilities, with "preferring AI solutions" being a broader preference and "valuing AI's intuition and creative problem-solving" being a more specific aspect of that preference.
Criteria: Participants value AI's capabilities and prefer to use them in their work.
Phrase: Valuing AI's problem-solving abilities.

2.
Concepts: collaborates with ai in a human-like manner, integrates ai into workflow and implies human help integration
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the integration of AI into the participant's workflow, with "collaborates with AI in a human-like manner" focusing on the interaction style and "integrates AI into workflow and implies human help integration" focusing on the practical integration.
Criteria: Participants integrate AI into their workflow and interact with it in a human-like manner.
Phrase: Collaborating with AI.

3.
Concepts: learning from ai mistakes, interprets and fixes ai mistakes
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the process of dealing with AI mistakes, with "learning from AI mistakes" being a more general concept and "interprets and fixes AI mistakes" being a more specific action.
Criteria: Participants learn from and correct AI mistakes.
Phrase: Debugging AI mistakes.

4.
Concepts: prefers iterative model creation, is willing to iteratively engage with ai
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the participant's willingness to engage with AI in an iterative process, with "prefers iterative model creation" focusing on the model creation aspect and "is willing to iteratively engage with AI" focusing on the engagement aspect.
Criteria: Participants prefer an iterative approach to model creation and are willing to engage with AI in this process.
Phrase: Engaging in iterative model creation.

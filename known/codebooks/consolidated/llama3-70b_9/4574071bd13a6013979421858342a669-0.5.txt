You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: solicit user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

2.
Label: research and development
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

3.
Label: explain focus areas
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

9.
Label: circuit diagram tool development
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

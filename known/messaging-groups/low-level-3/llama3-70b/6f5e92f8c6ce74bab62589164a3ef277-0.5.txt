Thoughts: For this conversation, I want to explore how the online community is emerging through the interactions between participants. I'll be looking for signs of social bonding, community cohesion, and knowledge sharing. I'll also consider how the participants are using humor and self-deprecation to build relationships. From a learning sciences perspective, I'll examine how the participants are inquiring, explaining, and sharing knowledge with each other. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll analyze how the participants are using the online platform to facilitate their interactions.

Tags for each message:
1. self deprecation; humor; social bonding
2. agreement; social support; community cohesion
3. agreement; social support; community cohesion

6. explanation; knowledge sharing; community education; social learning
7. explanation; knowledge sharing; community education
8. hesitation; uncertainty; self-doubt
9. problem-solving; information seeking; online resources

Summary: This conversation starts with a humorous exchange between participants, with P14 using self-deprecation to build relationships. The conversation then shifts to a discussion about the meaning of "+1", with participants showing agreement and social support for each other. When P10 asks what "+1" means, the conversation becomes a knowledge-sharing activity, with participants explaining and educating each other. The conversation also touches on online literacy and the use of online resources.

Notes: It's interesting to see how the participants are using humor and self-deprecation to build relationships and create a sense of community. The conversation also highlights the importance of knowledge sharing and explanation in the online community. I'm starting to see how the participants are using the online platform to facilitate their interactions and build social bonds.

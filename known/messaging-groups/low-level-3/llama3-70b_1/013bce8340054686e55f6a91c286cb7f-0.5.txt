You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (5 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
5. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

Thoughts: I'll focus on identifying the initial interactions between the designer and community members, exploring how the designer responds to user requests and how users perceive the platform. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective to understand how users are introducing themselves and their roles in the community.

Tags for each message:
1. (no text)
2. Avatar customization; User feedback; Designer response
3. Platform functionality; PC version inquiry
4. Avatar upload; Designer assistance; User role inquiry
5. User role; Teacher identity

Summary: The conversation begins with an image shared by P8, followed by a request from P8 to the designer to upload a high-definition avatar. The designer responds and inquires about P8's role, which is revealed to be a teacher. Meanwhile, P4229 asks about a PC version of the platform.

Notes: The designer is actively engaging with users, addressing their concerns, and inquiring about their roles. This could indicate an effort to build a sense of community and understand user needs. The presence of a teacher in the community might imply that the platform is being explored for educational purposes.

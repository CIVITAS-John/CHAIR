You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: experiencing frustration with ai failure, experiencing frustration with ai interactions
- Experiences frustration when the AI gets stuck or fails to fix an error
- Expressing frustration with error messages or AI interactions

2.
Concepts: notes lack of determinism, non-deterministic, finding ai responses unpredictable
- Notes AI's non-deterministic response patterns
- Participants note that AI responses can be non-deterministic, sometimes providing different results or instructions.
- Describes the AI's responses as unpredictable and non-deterministic

3.
Concepts: utilize ai for translation, leverage ai for netlogo tasks
- The participant finds AI helpful for translating models from other languages into NetLogo.
- The participant uses AI for NetLogo-related tasks, such as translating models from other languages.

4.
Concepts: smart editors, critiques netlogo's limitations
- Participants discuss the lack of smart editors in NetLogo, comparing it to other languages that have this feature.
- Participants critique NetLogo's lack of smart editors.

5.
Concepts: augment human judgment with ai
- The participant emphasizes the importance of augmenting human capabilities and judgment with AI assistance.
- The participant emphasizes the importance of augmenting human judgment with AI rather than replacing it.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: experiencing frustration with ai failure, experiencing frustration with ai interactions
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as participants experience frustration when the AI fails or provides unsatisfactory interactions.
Criteria: Participants express frustration when AI fails to fix errors or provides unhelpful interactions.
Phrase: Expresses frustration with AI failure and interactions.

2.
Concepts: notes lack of determinism, non-deterministic, finding ai responses unpredictable
Relationship: The three concepts are interconnected, as participants note the lack of determinism in AI responses, which leads to unpredictable outcomes.
Criteria: Participants identify AI responses as non-deterministic and unpredictable.
Phrase: Notes AI's non-deterministic responses.

3.
Concepts: utilize ai for translation, leverage ai for netlogo tasks
Relationship: The two concepts are related, as participants utilize AI for translating models and leverage AI for various NetLogo tasks.
Criteria: Participants use AI for translating models and completing NetLogo-related tasks.
Phrase: Utilizes AI for NetLogo tasks.

4.
Concepts: smart editors, critiques netlogo's limitations
Relationship: The two concepts are related, as participants critique NetLogo's limitations, specifically the lack of smart editors.
Criteria: Participants criticize NetLogo for lacking smart editors.
Phrase: Critiques NetLogo's limitations.

5.
Concepts: augment human judgment with ai
Relationship: N/A, as there is only one concept.
Criteria: Participants emphasize the importance of augmenting human judgment with AI assistance.
Phrase: Augments human judgment with AI.

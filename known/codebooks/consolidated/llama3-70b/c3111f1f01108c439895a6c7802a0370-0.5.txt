You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes.
Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

7.
Label: educational focus
Quotes:
- First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

Label: mechanics
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

18.
Label: physics lab features
Quotes:
- The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

19.
Label: technical solution
Quotes:
- Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Win7 should be fine.

- Does the class have internet?

27.
Label: institutional policy
Quotes:
- Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

28.
Label: social cue
Quotes:
- Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
- @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.
- [Emoji][Emoji]

29.
Label: import/export functionality
Quotes:
- If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

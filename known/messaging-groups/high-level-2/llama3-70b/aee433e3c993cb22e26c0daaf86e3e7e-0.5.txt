Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- "Example quote 1"
- "Example quote 2"

1. P8: [Image 2-0]
2. Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?
3. P4229: PC version?
4. Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
5. P4229: Yes.

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction:

---
* Summary
The conversation starts with a user (P8) sharing an image, and the Designer responds to help with uploading a high-definition version of the avatar. The conversation then shifts to the Designer asking if P4229 is a teacher, and P4229 confirms.

* Plan
This conversation can be analyzed from multiple theoretical angles, including learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do users interact with each other and the platform to achieve their goals? How do designers facilitate or hinder user interactions? What roles do users take on in the community, and how do they negotiate these roles?

# Community Building
## Technical Assistance
Definition: Instances where users or designers offer or receive technical help.
- "How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?"
- "I'll upload one now..."
- (Implicit in the conversation, but not explicitly quoted: P8's initial sharing of the image)

# User Roles
## Self-Disclosure
Definition: Instances where users reveal information about themselves.
- "Yes. (in response to 'Are you a teacher?')"

# Designer Facilitation
## Proactive Support
Definition: Instances where the Designer initiates help or guidance.
- "I'll upload one now..."
- "Are you a teacher?" (initiating a conversation)

# Platform Use
## Feature Requests
Definition: Instances where users request or discuss platform features.
- "How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?"

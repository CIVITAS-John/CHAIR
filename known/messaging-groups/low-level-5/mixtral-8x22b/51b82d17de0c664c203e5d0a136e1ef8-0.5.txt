You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation begins with a user seeking attention and the designers promoting group sharing and collaboration. The designers provide download instructions and update information, soliciting community feedback for further development. Users express support and engage with the conversation, reacting positively to the updates. A user inquires about a user manual, leading to a discussion about the software's design philosophy and the need for additional instructions. Users express their needs and preferences for software improvements, and the designers share their research direction and development goals. The conversation ends with the designers acknowledging advice on the development approach.
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary phrases: explaining bidirectional conversion; promoting problem solving
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary phrases: advising on development approach; promoting categorization and refinement
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary phrases: acknowledging advice; considering development approach
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

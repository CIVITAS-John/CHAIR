Summary of previous conversation: The conversation continues to delve into technical discussions on components and user interactions with the designer. Users share feedback, make suggestions for hardware additions, and discuss platform features. The dialogue also touches on humor, user engagement, revenue models, and educational aspects, reflecting a diverse range of topics and perspectives within the Physics Lab online community.
1. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but that you don't know how to pay
Preliminary tags: payment process; user perspective
2. P11: It can also be adapted to 3D touch
Preliminary tags: hardware adaptation; user suggestion
3. Designer: Just charge directly through the app store?
Preliminary tags: revenue model; payment methods
4. P14: Feels a bit troublesome
5. P2: ……
6. Designer: Now you can do it with just a fingerprint on the app store
7. P14: After all, just a middle school kid
8. Designer: That's true
9. Designer: Then just click on ads hh
10. P14: That's doable
11. P2: What's wrong with middle school [Emoji 1-268]
12. P2: Even a middle schooler is better than you
13. P11: Just hope the ads don't take up too much of the experiment interface
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
15. P11: He means he doesn't have a good payment method in middle school
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
19. Designer: Just let you click on ads to earn points, and use points to unlock new content
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can follow the network cable to hit me
21. P2: I can program
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 1-280]
24. Designer: Permanent ad banners on iOS are really disgusting
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen is not big and has psoriasis.
27. P2: And it forces you to click.
28. P2: What are the ads used for @Designer 
29. Designer: Health preservation...
30. Designer: Doing this requires nurturing people...
31. P1: It's not free.
32. Designer: Actually, it's the same as charging money, except you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay.
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do a bit more.
35. Designer: There are some other ways.

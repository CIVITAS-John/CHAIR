You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: design suggestion
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

2.
Label: followup
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- User: Win7 should be fine.

6.
Label: clarification
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

7.
Label: explain the intention of followup question

17.
Label: indirect reject
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

21.
Label: talk about limitation of the solution
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

22.
Label: accepting suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

23.
Label: personal anecdote
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

24.
Label: resource request
Quotes:
- User: Need the user manual for this software

25.
Label: name a specific person

Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

27.
Label: explanation of upcoming features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

28.
Label: give an intro to the update content
Quotes:

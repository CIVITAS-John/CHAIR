You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: human-ai (negative): conflict?, experiencing frustration with ai errors
- User experiences conflict with AI when it shows errors in seemingly correct code.
- The user expresses frustration with the AI's performance, particularly with errors and loops.

2.
Concepts: reflecting on novice debugging challenges, highlighting novice help-seeking challenges
- The user reflects on the importance of debugging skills and the challenges novices face in this area.
- The user notes challenges novices face in help-seeking and highlights inefficiencies in their coding practices that impact error identification.

3.
Concepts: calls for improved netlogo error messaging, suggesting linting features for netlogo
- User calls for better error messaging in NetLogo.
- The user highlights the need for linting features, critiques NetLogo's editor, and suggests improvements.

4.
Concepts: prefers hands-on debugging of ai-generated code, identifies and debugs errors in ai-generated code
- The user prefers to manually debug errors in AI-generated code and corrects issues independently.
- The user identifies bugs and gaps in AI-generated code and corrects errors independently.

5.
Concepts: adjusts task complexity, customizing ai-generated code

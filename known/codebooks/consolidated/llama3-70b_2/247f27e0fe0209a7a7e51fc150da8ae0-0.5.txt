You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: design constraints, explaining technical constraints
- Designers acknowledging or working within design constraints, such as usability or technical limitations.
- Designers explain technical aspects or limitations of the application to users.

2.
Concepts: share development plans and timelines
- Designers share plans, roadmaps, or timelines for future development, providing estimates for new releases or features.
- Designers provide information about upcoming updates, features, or changes to the online community.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: design constraints, explaining technical constraints
Relationship: The designers' acknowledgment of design constraints logically leads to explaining technical constraints to users.
Criteria: Designers acknowledge and explain technical constraints to users, considering usability and limitations.
Phrase: Explaining technical constraints within design limitations.

2.
Concepts: share development plans and timelines
Relationship: Sharing development plans and timelines are complementary aspects of providing information about future development.
Criteria: Designers share plans, roadmaps, or timelines for future development, providing estimates for new releases or features.
Phrase: Sharing development plans and timelines.

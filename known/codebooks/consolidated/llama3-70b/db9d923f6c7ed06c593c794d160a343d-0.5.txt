You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: user context
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
- User: Mainly, the school is building an information-based school
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.

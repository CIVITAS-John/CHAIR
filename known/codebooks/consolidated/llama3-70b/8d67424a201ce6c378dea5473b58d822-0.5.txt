You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: user communication, progress communication and planning
- Designer communicates updates, progress, or responses to users.
- A user or designer communicates progress or updates on the project, or communicates about progress, plans, or timelines.

2.
Concepts: emotional expression, user contribution
- A user or designer expresses emotion or uses emotive language.
- User expresses emotions or reactions through emojis or words, and users contributing to the design or development process.

3.
Concepts: future design plans, future development
- Discusses or plans for future design or development goals.
- Designers share information about future development plans, goals, or current research.

4.
Concepts: user feedback and reactions
- Users provide feedback or reactions to Physics Lab, or designers ask users for input to inform future development.
- Designers actively seek feedback or suggestions from users, asking for opinions or ideas.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: user communication, progress communication and planning
Relationship: Inclusion (progress communication and planning are forms of user communication)
Criteria: Designer or user communicates updates, progress, or plans related to the project.
Label: Project Updates and Planning

2.
Concepts: emotional expression, user contribution
Relationship: Intersection (emotional expression is a way for users to contribute to the design process)
Criteria: User or designer expresses emotions or reactions, and/or contributes to the design or development process.
Label: Emotional User Engagement

3.
Concepts: future design plans, future development
Relationship: Inclusion (future development is a form of future design plans)
Criteria: Discussion or planning for future design or development goals.
Label: Future Development Plans

4.
Concepts: user feedback and reactions
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Users provide feedback or reactions to Physics Lab, or designers seek input from users.
Label: User Feedback and Reactions

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (19 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...

Thoughts: This conversation seems to revolve around participants trying to understand and operate some kind of experimental setup or simulation, likely related to Physics Lab. There are questions about features, requests for clarification, and sharing of images to illustrate the setup. To analyze the emergence of the online community, I will look for tags related to collaboration, knowledge sharing, problem-solving, and community dynamics.

Tags for each message (19 in total):
1. experimental instructions; gameplay guidance; gamified learning
2. questioning features; seeking clarification  
3. expressing understanding; gameplay feedback
4. visual aid; sharing information
5. visual aid; sharing information
6. demonstrating comprehension; gameplay progress
7. seeking instructions; requesting guidance
8. suggesting approach; collaborative problem-solving
9. providing instructions; sharing knowledge
10. simplifying explanation; encouraging participation
11. requesting guidance; seeking instructions
12. inquiring about data display; exploring features
13. referring to interface element; seeking clarification
14. visual aid; sharing information  
15. step-by-step instructions; guiding participation
16. expressing understanding; acknowledging guidance
17. visual aid; sharing information
18. requesting guidance; seeking instructions
19. prompting for response; facilitating discussion

Summary: The conversation revolves around participants engaging with an experimental setup or simulation in Physics Lab. They ask questions, share images, provide instructions, and collaborate to understand and operate the setup. The designer guides the participants through the gameplay, encouraging exploration and offering explanations. Participants demonstrate their understanding, seek clarification, and work together to progress through the experimental process.

Notes: The online community seems to be emerging through collaborative problem-solving, knowledge sharing, and facilitated discussions around the Physics Lab simulation. Participants are actively engaged, asking questions, offering suggestions, and supporting each other's learning. The designer plays a crucial role in guiding the participants and fostering a supportive learning environment. The use of visual aids and step-by-step instructions facilitates understanding and encourages participation.

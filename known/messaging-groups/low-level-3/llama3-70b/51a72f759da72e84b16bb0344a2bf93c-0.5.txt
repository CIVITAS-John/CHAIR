You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (10 in total):
1. {an interpretation of message 1}
...
10. {an interpretation of message 10}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary codes: ** appreciation**: user 4230 expresses gratitude for designer 1's hard work
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary codes: ** platform inquiry**: user 4231 asks about downloading the pc/interactive whiteboard version of physics lab
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary codes: ** resource location**: user 4231 finds the group files; resolving their inquiry
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary codes: ** component update**: designer 1 announces that dry batteries will no longer be ideal components in the next update; allowing users to simulate by removing internal resistance
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary codes: ** component introduction**: designer 1 introduces the student power supply; an ideal component that supports both dc and ac
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

Thoughts: For this initial coding round, I'll focus on understanding the context and intent behind each message. I'll explore how the designers and users interact, what information is being shared, and what questions are being asked. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective to identify how users are learning and interacting with the Physics Lab online community. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll examine how users are navigating the platform and what features are being discussed. Finally, from a participatory design perspective, I'll look for instances of co-design and collaboration between designers and users.

Codes for each message:

1. **Appreciation**: user 4230 expresses gratitude for designer 1's hard work
2. **Platform inquiry**: user 4231 asks about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab
3. **Resource location**: user 4231 finds the group files; resolving their inquiry
4. **Image sharing**: designer 1 shares an image
5. **Component update**: designer 1 announces that dry batteries will no longer be ideal components in the next update; allowing users to simulate by removing internal resistance
6. **Component introduction**: designer 1 introduces the student power supply; an ideal component that supports both DC and AC
7. **Call for feedback**: designer 1 encourages users to provide more suggestions
8. **Usage inquiry**: user 4232 asks about using the PC version
9. **Image sharing**: user 4232 shares an image
10. **System limitation**: designer 2 mentions that the platform does not support the XP system

Summary: The conversation revolves around users inquiring about the platform, with user 4231 asking about downloading the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab and user 4232 asking about using the PC version. Designer 1 shares information about upcoming updates, introduces new components, and encourages user feedback. The conversation also involves image sharing and discussion about system limitations.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, providing updates and information about the platform. Users are inquiring about specific features and functionality, and the designers are responding to their questions. This suggests a collaborative and participatory approach to design. I hypothesize that the designers are using this online community to gather feedback and iterate on the platform.

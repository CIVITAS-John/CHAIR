You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (32 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: mentions optimizing circuit diagram layout
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

2.
Label: development goals
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

3.
Label: designer 2 informs about system compatibility
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

10.

19.
Label: suggest improvements
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

20.
Label: user 4237 acknowledges update
Quotes:
- User: Updated
- User: ok

21.
Label: justifying development decisions
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

22.
Label: demonstrating domain expertise
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

23.
Label: user 4234 engages with design philosophy
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”

24.
Label: prioritizing electromagnetism
Quotes:

27.
Label: confirms action
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

28.
Label: plans to gather opinions
Quotes:

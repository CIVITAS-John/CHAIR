You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1.
Concepts: share debugging experience, use ai for debugging and recall previous experiences
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as participants share their debugging experiences with AI, which is facilitated by their ability to use AI for debugging and recall previous experiences, highlighting the importance of prior experience in effective AI-assisted debugging.
Criteria: Participants strategically interact with AI-driven interfaces, utilize AI for debugging, and reflect on previous experiences to overcome challenges.
Phrase: Strategically leveraging AI for debugging.

2.
Concepts: recognize ai interface complexity, experience frustration with ai limitations and interfaces
Relationship: The concepts are logically related as participants' recognition of AI interface complexity leads to frustration with AI limitations and difficulties with AI-driven interfaces, highlighting the negative impact of complex interfaces on user experience.
Criteria: Participants identify design limitations, struggle with interface design, and express frustration with AI limitations when interacting with AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Frustrated by AI interface limitations.

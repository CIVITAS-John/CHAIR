You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (15 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
15. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer: I guess it's because the teacher finds it annoying when people talk too much.233
Preliminary tags: speculation; teacher's perspective
2. P1: hello
Preliminary tags: greeting
3. P4: [Image 6]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
4. P5: 233 By the way, let's see if there are any good designs to learn from.
Preliminary tags: interest in learning; design inspiration
5. Designer: Good design?
Preliminary tags: seeking clarification
6. P6: Like a microcomputer.
Preliminary tags: design reference; technology
7. Designer: Let's talk about logic gates.
8. P2: The CPU of a computer is made up of logic gates.
9. P5: Hmm.
10. P5: I need logic gates for making a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
11. P6: [Image 14]
12. P6: [Image 15]
13. P7: How to play?
14. Designer: Play by conducting experiments.233
15. P8: Why suddenly add a wave?

Thoughts: It's important to capture various aspects of the conversation, including interactions between participants, topics being discussed, and any emerging themes or patterns. Consider the roles of the designer, the interest in learning and design, technology references, and the use of images in communication.

Tags for each message:
1. speculation; teacher's perspective
2. greeting
3. image sharing
4. interest in learning; design inspiration
5. seeking clarification
6. design reference; technology
7. topic introduction
8. technology reference
9. acknowledgement
10. practical application
11. image sharing
12. image sharing
13. inquiry
14. guidance
15. confusion; seeking explanation

Summary: The conversation starts with the designer speculating about a teacher's perspective on excessive talking. Participants greet each other, share images, express interest in learning from designs, and discuss topics like logic gates, technology, and practical applications in building a calculator. The use of images and references to experimentation and waves add depth to the conversation.

Notes: The conversation seems to revolve around a mix of technical discussions, design inspiration, and practical applications in learning and experimenting with physics concepts. The use of images and references to technology and experimentation indicates an engaged and interactive online community within Physics Lab.

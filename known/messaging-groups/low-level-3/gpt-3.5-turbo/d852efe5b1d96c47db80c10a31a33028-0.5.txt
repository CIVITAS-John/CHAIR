You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (9 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...

1. P4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary tags: physics concepts demonstration; interactive learning materials
2. Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary tags: prioritization; content development
3. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary tags: user feedback gathering; memory aid techniques
4. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; community interaction
5. P4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary tags: software download inquiry; platform compatibility
6. P4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary tags: resource location; user acknowledgment
7. Designer: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

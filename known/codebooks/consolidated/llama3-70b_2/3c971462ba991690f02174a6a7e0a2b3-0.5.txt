You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: gives an answer
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- Designer: Group sharing.

2.
Label: justifying the limitations of free experiments
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

3.
Label: providing expertise
Quotes:
- User: Left side

4.
Label: seeks guidance on platform usage
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

5.
Label: agreeing with the previous suggestion
Quotes:
- User: @John Chen (3) Yes, yes.

6.
Label: acknowledgement
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- User: [Emoji]
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.
- User: This idea is really good

7.
Label: technical limitations are communicated directly
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

8.
Label: balancing transparency with managing expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

9.
Label: seeks guidance on uploading high definition avatar
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

10.

- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

15.
Label: manages user anticipation
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

18.
Label: clarification question
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

19.
Label: envisioning assessment tools
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

20.
Label: confirming design direction
Quotes:
- Designer: Okay.

21.
Label: give reason
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

22.
Label: praise software
Quotes:
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

23.
Label: raise related issue
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

24.
Label: express personal interest
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

25.
Label: confirms that reason
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.

26.
Label: apologizing for delays

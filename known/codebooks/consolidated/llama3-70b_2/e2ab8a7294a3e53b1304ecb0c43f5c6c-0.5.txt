You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: suggesting ai saves time, envisioning ai's time-saving potential
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both express the idea that AI can save time, with "suggesting" implying a more tentative or hypothetical tone, while "envisioning" implies a more concrete or vivid imagination of this potential.
Criteria: Participants suggest or envision AI-driven interfaces saving time for learning new NetLogo extensions.
Phrase: Envisioning time-saving potential

2.
Concepts: preferring simple code, prioritizing simplicity
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both express a preference for simplicity, with "preferring" implying a more general or overall preference, while "prioritizing" implies a more deliberate or intentional ranking of simplicity as a goal.
Criteria: Participants prefer or prioritize simple code for maintainability and readability.
Phrase: Prioritizing simplicity

3.
Concepts: discussing importance of clear instructions, identifying importance of instruction writing skills
Relationship: The concepts are related in that they both highlight the importance of clear instructions, with "discussing" implying a more general or conversational tone, while "identifying" implies a more explicit or deliberate recognition of this importance.
Criteria: Participants discuss or identify the importance of writing clear instructions for effective AI utilization.
Phrase: Identifying importance of clear instructions

4.
Concepts: verifies code
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants verify code, including checking for reserved words or errors, or request verification of AI-generated code.
Phrase: Verifying code

5.
Concepts: limited time for learning
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants acknowledge limited time for learning and mastering new concepts, including AI-generated code.
Phrase: Acknowledging time constraints

6.
Concepts: reflecting on novice struggles
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: Participants reflect on the struggles of novices, including lack of debugging skills and conceptual understanding, when working with the AI system.

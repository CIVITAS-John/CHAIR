You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (9 in total):
1. {interpretation of message 1}; {another}; ...
...
9. {interpretation of message 9}; {another}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
Preliminary codes: request for features; mechanical waves demonstration; optical experiments; user expectations
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
Preliminary codes: priority setting; development roadmap; electrical section prioritization
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
Preliminary codes: gathering opinions; user feedback; decision making process
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary codes: appreciation expression; community gratitude
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
Preliminary codes: pc version inquiry; platform access
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
Preliminary codes: file access; resource sharing; community support
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Thoughts: In this first round of coding, I aim to identify the primary concerns and interactions between users and designers in the Physics Lab online community. I will focus on the language used, the tone, and the intentions behind each message. I'll explore how users are shaping the development of Physics Lab and how designers are responding to their requests. I'll also examine how the community is forming around the shared goal of creating an online physics laboratory.

Codes for each message:

1. request for features; mechanical waves demonstration; optical experiments; user expectations
2. priority setting; development roadmap; electrical section prioritization; designer's vision
3. gathering opinions; user feedback; decision making process; community involvement
4. appreciation expression; community gratitude; acknowledgement of effort
5. pc version inquiry; platform access; user needs
6. file access; resource sharing; community support; sense of belonging
7. image sharing; community engagement; visual communication
8. update announcement; component modification; simulation improvement
9. component explanation; ideal component introduction; educational content

Summary: The conversation revolves around the development of Physics Lab, with users making requests and designers responding to them. Users are interested in specific features, such as mechanical waves and optical experiments, and designers are prioritizing their development roadmap. The community is forming around the shared goal of creating an online physics laboratory, with users showing appreciation for the designers' efforts and designers seeking user feedback.

Notes: The conversation suggests that the Physics Lab online community is emerging around a shared goal, with users driving the development process through their requests and feedback. Designers are actively engaging with users, seeking their opinions, and responding to their needs. The community is forming around a sense of shared purpose, with users showing gratitude and designers working to improve the platform.

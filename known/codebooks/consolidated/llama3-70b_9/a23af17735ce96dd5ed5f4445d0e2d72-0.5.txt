You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

6.
Label: justifying the limitations of free experiments

- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

17.
Label: discuss input methods

- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

18.
Label: prompting user feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- Designer: Okay. Please give more suggestions!

19.

Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

20.

21.
Label: seeks guidance on how to use the pc version
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

22.
Label: adapting to user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

23.
Label: engaging in design dialogue
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

24.
Label: informing users

26.
Label: suggesting development approach
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

27.

29.
Label: streamlining functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: Make it simpler...

30.
Label: highlighting benefits
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

31.
Label: providing feedback on circuit diagram functionality
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
4. Designer-1: There will be.
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

* Summary
The conversation revolves around a user (User-4232) providing feedback and suggestions for the Physics Lab software to the designers (Designer-1 and Designer-2). The key points discussed include adding an export/import function to save and load experiments locally, addressing network restrictions in schools, and the positive reception of the software's simulation effects from students. User-4232 also shares their teaching experience in middle and high schools.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation from the perspectives of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can focus on the following aspects:

1. Learning sciences: Examine how the software facilitates learning experiences for students, teachers' pedagogical approaches, and the integration of technology in educational settings.

2. Human-computer interaction: Explore the usability and user experience of the software, including the requested features (export/import), compatibility with school network restrictions, and the simulation's effectiveness in engaging students.

3. Participatory design: Investigate the collaboration between users (teachers) and designers in shaping the software's development, considering the feedback and suggestions provided by User-4232.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. User-4232: Thank you.
2. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
3. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
4. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
5. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
6. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:
7. Designer-1: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
8. User-4232: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
9. Designer-1: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
10. Designer-2: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
11. Designer-1: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.
12. Designer-1: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
13. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
14. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
15. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
16. Designer-1: There will be.
17. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
18. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].

* Summary
The conversation involves users and designers discussing the usage, features, and updates of Physics Lab software. Users provide feedback and suggestions, while designers respond with solutions and plans for future updates.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we will focus on identifying how user feedback and designer responses contribute to the development and improvement of the Physics Lab's online community. We will explore themes such as user engagement, iterative design, and collaborative problem-solving. Guiding questions include: How do users contribute to the design process? How do designers incorporate user feedback? What role does communication play in the emergence of the community?

# User Engagement
## Express satisfaction
Definition: Users express positive feedback about the software, indicating satisfaction and practicality.
- "This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use."
- "Thank you."

## Provide suggestions
Definition: Users suggest new features or improvements to enhance the software's functionality.
- "It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards."
- "If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class."

# Iterative Design
## Release updates
Definition: Designers announce and detail new versions and updates of the software.
- "Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows..."
- "I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend."

## Address compatibility
Definition: Designers discuss and plan for software compatibility with different operating systems and devices.
- "XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine."
- "Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards)."

# Collaborative Problem-Solving
## Respond to feedback
Definition: Designers acknowledge user feedback and provide solutions or plans to address the issues.
- "No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group."
- "Hmm... I'll add it in the next update."
- "There will be."

## Discuss technical constraints
Definition: Designers and users discuss technical limitations and potential workarounds.
- "Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards."
- "But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case."
- "Does the class have internet?"
- "Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers."

# Participatory Design
## Engage in dialogue
Definition: Continuous interaction between users and designers to collaboratively improve the software.
- "Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?"
- "Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = ="
- "@Designer-1 Yes, yes."

## Plan future features
Definition: Designers and users discuss and plan for future features and updates based on user needs.
- "If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient."
- "There will be."
- "Does the class have internet?"
- "Generally not..."

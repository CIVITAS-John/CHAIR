You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1.
Concepts: seek ai syntax support, requesting ai assistance
Relationship: The concepts are related in that seeking AI syntax support is a specific type of requesting AI assistance, where the participant needs help with syntax-related issues in NetLogo programming.
Criteria: Participants request AI assistance for syntax support in NetLogo programming.
Phrase: Request AI assistance

2.
Concepts: selectively adopting ai code, customizing and adapting to ai-generated code
Relationship: The concepts are related in that selectively adopting AI code is a precursor to customizing and adapting to AI-generated code, where participants choose to use certain parts of the code and then modify it to fit their needs.
Criteria: Participants adapt AI-generated code to support their work.
Phrase: Adapt AI-generated code

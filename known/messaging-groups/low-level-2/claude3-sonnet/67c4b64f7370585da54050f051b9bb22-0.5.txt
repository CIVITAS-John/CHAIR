You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

Summary of the conversation until now: This conversation takes place in an online community focused on developing a physics lab simulation software. The designer shares updates on new features, solicits feedback from users, and discusses future plans for the software. Community members express interest, ask questions, provide feedback, and suggest additional features or use cases. There is a collaborative dynamic between the designer and users, with the designer being responsive to user needs and the community shaping the software's development.
1. P4232: Not asking for everything, should be categorized and refined one by one
2. Designer: Hmm.
3. Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
4. P4232: Indeed
5. Designer: I am also a bit interested in chemistry
6. Designer: I will consider creating one if the opportunity arises
7. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
8. P4232: This is a really good idea
9. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
10. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

11. Designer: [Image]This one.
12. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.

Summary: This conversation revolves around the development of a physics lab simulation software. The designer shares updates on new features, future plans, and seeks feedback from the community. Users express interest, provide feedback, and make suggestions for additional features or use cases. There is a collaborative dynamic between the designer and users, with the designer being responsive to user needs and the community shaping the software's development.

Notes:
- The designer is open to feedback and suggestions from the community, actively soliciting input and expressing willingness to collaborate on new features.
- Users provide positive feedback, agree with the designer's plans, and make suggestions for additional features or improvements.
- There is a sense of mutual interest and collaboration between the designer and the community, with both parties contributing to the software's development.
- The conversation touches on various aspects of the software, including simulations for different physics domains, experimental assessment functions, and user interface elements.
- The designer seeks specific feedback from teachers in the community regarding user interface conventions used in textbooks.

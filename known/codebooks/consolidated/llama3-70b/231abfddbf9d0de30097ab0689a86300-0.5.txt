You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
- Designer: After connecting the student power supply, you need to turn on the switch
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

22.
Label: explaining the need
Quotes:
- Designer: We are working on this part

23.
Label: explaining design limitations

- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

24.
Label: introducing new components
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

25.
Label: explaining new features
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

26.
Label: followup on gradelevel
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

27.
Label: explaining technical possibilities
Quotes:

28.
Label: providing resources
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

29.
Label: design suggestion
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

Label: seeking technical guidance
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?
- User: How to download?

31.
Label: transparent developer discussion*
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.
- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

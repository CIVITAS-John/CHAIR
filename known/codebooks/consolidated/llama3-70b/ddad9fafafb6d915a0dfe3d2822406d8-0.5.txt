You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: co-creation, collaborative decision-making
- The degree to which the designers and users work together to shape the final product, with users playing an active role in the design decisions.
- Designers make decisions based on user feedback, involving collaborative decision-making with users or stakeholders.

2.
Concepts: community resource sharing, sharing information
- Users share community resources, such as user manuals or group files, discussing software distribution.
- Instances where participants share information or resources to solve a problem or answer a question, the act of sharing information, resources, or updates with the community.

3.
Concepts: issue reporting, system support
- Reports of issues or problems encountered while using the Physics Lab software.
- Discussions or mentions of system support or compatibility, or users encounter issues related to the compatibility of Physics Lab with specific operating systems.

4.
Concepts: brief response, minimal feedback
- Providing a brief or concise response.
- Responding with minimal or no elaboration.

5.
Concepts: user suggestions, incorporating user suggestions
- The user's suggestions and feedback to the designer.
- Designers' responses to user feedback and suggestions, and how they plan to implement them in future updates.

6.
Concepts: user-centric design
- The extent to which the users' needs and preferences are being incorporated into the software's development.
- Designers make decisions to enhance user experience, focusing on usability and user experience aspects.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: co-creation, collaborative decision-making
Relationship: Inclusion (co-creation implies collaborative decision-making)
Criteria: Designers and users work together to shape the final product, with users playing an active role in design decisions.
Label: Collaborative Design Process

2.
Concepts: community resource sharing, sharing information
Relationship: Parallel (both concepts refer to sharing, but with different foci)
Criteria: Users share resources, information, or updates with the community to solve problems or answer questions.
Label: Community Knowledge Sharing

3.
Concepts: issue reporting, system support
Relationship: Intersection (issue reporting often involves system support or compatibility)
Criteria: Users report issues or problems with the Physics Lab software, including system support or compatibility concerns.
Label: Technical Issue Reporting

4.
Concepts: brief response, minimal feedback
Relationship: Inclusion (brief response implies minimal feedback)
Criteria: Respondents provide concise or minimal responses to questions or issues.
Label: Concise Feedback

5.
Concepts: user suggestions, incorporating user suggestions
Relationship: Inclusion (incorporating user suggestions implies considering user feedback)
Criteria: Users provide suggestions and feedback, and designers respond to and implement them in future updates.
Label: User Feedback Incorporation

6.
Concepts: user-centric design
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Designers prioritize users' needs and preferences in software development, focusing on usability and user experience.
Label: User-Centric Design Approach

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
Upon reviewing the draft merging plan, I noticed that:

* The category "inquiry-based learning" could be merged with "collaborative practices" as they both relate to learning approaches.
* The category "autonomous learning" could be merged with "learning strategies" as they both relate to individual learning.
* The category "community governance" is quite large and could be split into smaller categories, such as "decision-making" and "conflict resolution".
* The category "educational background" could be merged with "user demographics" as they both relate to user characteristics.
* The category "gamification" could be merged with "technological affordances" as they both relate to platform features.

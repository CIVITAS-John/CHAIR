Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1

1. Designer: Play by conducting experiments ðŸ˜‚
2. P8: Why suddenly add a wave?
3. P7: Oh
4. P2: [Image 20]
5. P2: [Image 21]
6. P7: 66
7. P7: How to connect
8. P7: Let him
9. P2: The wiring is all on top
10. P2: It's still very simple
11. P7: How to make it work
12. P7: How to display the data
13. P7: That key
14. P2: [Image 30]
15. P2: Just press the button with the wire
16. P7: Oh
17. P9: [Image 33]
18. P9: æ€Žä¹ˆè®©ä»–å·¥ä½œ
19. Designer: ï¼Ÿ

Here is a codebook to analyze the interaction in the Physics Lab's online message group:

---
* Summary
A conversation among Physics Lab community members, including a designer, discussing an experiment, sharing images, and asking questions about connecting and displaying data.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design to understand how the Physics Lab's online community emerged. Guiding questions include: How do community members collaborate and share knowledge? What role does the designer play in facilitating the conversation? How do participants use images and text to communicate?

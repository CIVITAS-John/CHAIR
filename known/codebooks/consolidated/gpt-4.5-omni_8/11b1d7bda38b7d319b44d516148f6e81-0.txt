You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: observing ai response unpredictability, chatgpt ability (negative): not deterministic
- User notes AI's inconsistent understanding and observes the unpredictability of its responses.
- User notes the AI's responses are not consistent or predictable, leading to a lack of determinism.

2.
Concepts: noting ai's error handling issues, experiencing frustration with ai debugging
- User notes that AI can get stuck in a loop and fail to resolve or communicate errors effectively.
- User finds AI error messages unhelpful and experiences frustration during debugging.

3.
Concepts: engaging in ai queries, experiments with ai queries
- User responds to AI's questions and follows up with specific queries for more detailed information.
- User experiments with different phrases and queries to see how the AI responds.

4.
Concepts: advocating ai as a peer programmer, peer-programming vs. do your own work
- User advocates for AI as a peer programmer and imagines it as a helpful pair programmer.
- User compares peer programming with solo programming and suggests AI could play a role.

5.
Concepts: discussing ai as an educational tool, considering ai for personalized learning
- User describes the collaborative process with AI and discusses its potential as an educational tool.
- User notes AI's teaching potential and considers its ability to create personalized learning pathways.

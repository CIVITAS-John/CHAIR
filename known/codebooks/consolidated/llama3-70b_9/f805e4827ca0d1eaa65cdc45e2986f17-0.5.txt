You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: give rationale to development decision
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

2.
Label: access
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

3.
Label: ask followup question on usage scenario
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

4.
Label: platform question
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

7.
Label: clarification question
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

8.
Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

9.
Label: propose another feature
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

Label: asking follow-up questions on needs
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

11.
Label: vague on responses to the feature request
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

12.
Label: communication about progress and plans
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

13.
Label: inquiring user input for future iterations
Quotes:
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.

14.
Label: answer about compatibility

- User: How do you use the PC version?
- User: Win7 should be fine.
- Designer: 7 is okay.

15.
Label: frustration
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

Label: promising it will realize
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

21.
Label: adding more specific information and criteria to the answer
Quotes:

22.
Label: listing what might need to be done
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

23.
Label: difficulty in development
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

24.
Label: feature discussion
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

25.
Label: community announcement
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

26.
Label: consulting community
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

27.
Label: community feedback
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- User: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

28.
Label: uncertainty
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

30.

31.
Label: further question
Quotes:
- Designer: So, use both?

32.
Label: appreciation of features
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
Tags should be descriptive of the event and its context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary tags: bidirectional conversion; physical and circuit diagrams
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary tags: feedback; categorization; refinement
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary tags: acknowledgement; consideration
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

Thoughts: For this conversation, I will focus on the emergence of Physics Lab's online community, exploring how designers and users interact and negotiate the development of the platform. I will analyze the conversation through the lens of participatory design, human-computer interaction, and learning sciences, looking for themes related to collaboration, feedback, and design decisions.

Tags for each message:
1. bidirectional conversion; physical and circuit diagrams; design functionality
2. feedback; categorization; refinement; iterative design
3. acknowledgement; consideration; brief response
4. physics focus areas; electricity and mechanics; limitations; future plans
5. agreement; acknowledgement
6. personal interest; chemistry; potential expansion
7. future plans; opportunity; chemistry experiment
8. simulated experiment assessment; experimental details; functionality
9. positive feedback; design approval
10. collaborative design; community involvement; decision-making
11. consulting teachers; circuit diagrams; textbook analysis
12. image sharing; circuit diagram example; design inspiration
13. confirmation; common practice; circuit diagram style

Summary: The conversation revolves around the design and development of Physics Lab, with designers and users discussing the platform's functionality, design decisions, and future plans. The designers share their ideas and plans, and users provide feedback and suggestions. The conversation touches on the focus areas of physics, the importance of categorization and refinement, and the potential for future expansion into other areas like chemistry.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, seeking feedback and involving them in the design process. The conversation suggests a collaborative and iterative approach to design, with a focus on creating a functional and user-friendly platform. The designers seem to be open to suggestions and willing to adapt their plans based on user feedback.

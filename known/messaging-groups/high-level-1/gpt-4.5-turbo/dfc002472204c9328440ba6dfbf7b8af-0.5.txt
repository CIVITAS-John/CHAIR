Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. P2: [Image 30]
2. P2: Just press the button with the wire
3. P7: Oh
4. P9: [Image 33]
5. P9: How to make it work
6. Designer: ？
7. P9: [Checkin 37]
8. P9: [Checkin 38]
9. P10: Hello everyone, I am a new member. Nice to meet you all. Thank you.
10. P11: Seeking advice on a question.
11. P11: [Image 41]
12. P11: This is a rectifier circuit.
13. P11: The verification should be correct.
14. P11: However,
15. P11: [Image 45]
16. P11: The image is not as expected.
17. P11: Not sure if it's a circuit problem or a software bug, seeking advice.
18. P11: [Image 48]
19. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
20. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
21. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits, so I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know, so please enlighten me in the future. Thank you.
22. P4: Has it been updated?
23. P11: It's not ideal...
24. P11: I will consider the impedance.

## New Member Introduction
Definition: Instances where new members introduce themselves to the community, indicating the growth and ongoing influx of new participants.
- Example quote 1: "P10: Hello everyone, I am a new member. Nice to meet you all. Thank you."
- Example quote 2: (No other explicit introductions in the provided text, but this example is sufficient to define the code.)

## Technical Support Request
Definition: Messages where members seek help or advice on technical issues related to their physics projects, indicating collaborative problem-solving within the community.
- Example quote 1: "P11: Not sure if it's a circuit problem or a software bug, seeking advice."
- Example quote 2: "P9: How to make it work"
- Example quote 3: "P11: Seeking advice on a question."

## Knowledge Sharing
Definition: Instances where members or the designer provide explanations, solutions, or insights in response to queries, reflecting the community’s role in disseminating knowledge.
- Example quote 1: "Designer: The diode is not ideal."
- Example quote 2: "Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?"
- Example quote 3: "P11: This is a rectifier circuit. The verification should be correct."

## Acknowledgment of Limitations
Definition: Moments when members acknowledge their own limitations in knowledge or experience, which can foster a supportive learning environment and encourage others to contribute.
- Example quote 1: "P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits, so I don't know."
- Example quote 2: "P11: It's not ideal... I will consider the impedance."
- Example quote 3: (No third example in the provided text, but these two are indicative of the code.)

These codes help in analyzing the dynamics of the Physics Lab's online community in terms of member engagement, problem-solving, and knowledge exchange, which are key factors in understanding how such communities emerge and function.

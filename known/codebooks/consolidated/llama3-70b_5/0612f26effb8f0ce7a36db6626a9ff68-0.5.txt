You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (32 in total):
1. 
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A descriptive label of code 1}

1.
Label: contextualizes physics lab's focus
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

2.
Label: concurring on design ideas
Quotes:
- User: This idea is really good

3.
Label: promising timely response
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.

4.
Label: confirms being a teacher
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

5.
Label: demonstrating friendliness
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello :)

6.
Label: informing users that the new version has been shared in the group
Quotes:
- Designer: The new version has already been sent in the group

7.
Label: managing community expectations
Quotes:
- Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.

8.
Label: promoting bidirectional conversion
Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

9.
Label: explaining institutional goals

11.
Label: claiming authority
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

12.
Label: explain feature importance
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

13.
Label: align with user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

14.
Label: explaining implementation plans

15.
Label: providing technical specifications
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

16.
Label: expressing software improvement needs
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

17.
Label: offering insight into prevailing practices
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

18.
Label: informing design decisions
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

19.
Label: offer solution
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?
- User: Win7 should be fine.

20.
Label: waiting for review
Quotes:
- Designer: iOS is waiting for review~

21.
Label: providing download link
Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

22.
Label: ask for download information
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

23.
Label: acknowledging the existence of group files
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

24.
Label: acknowledges update
Quotes:
- User: ok

25.
Label: outlining features
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

26.
Label: recommends incremental refinement
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

27.
Label: the presence of educators in the community suggests that physics lab may be targeting educational applications
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

28.
Label: shows consideration for users' time
Quotes:
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)

29.
Label: proposing optical experiment simulations
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

30.
Label: building user profile
Quotes:
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

31.
Label: seeking clarification on design preferences
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

32.
Label: validating software effectiveness
Quotes:
- User: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: optimizing, optimize code with ai
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the ability of AI to improve code performance, with "optimizing" being the action and "optimize code with AI" being the specific application of that action.
Criteria: Participants recognize AI's ability to optimize code and improve performance.
Phrase: Optimize code with AI.

2.
Concepts: designing learning pathways with ai, envision ai-driven learning pathways
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the role of AI in creating personalized learning experiences, with "designing learning pathways with AI" being the action and "envision ai-driven learning pathways" being the desired outcome.
Criteria: Participants perceive AI as designing personalized learning pathways.
Phrase: Design learning pathways with AI.

3.
Concepts: frustration point, express frustration with ai errors
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the emotional response of participants when interacting with AI, with "frustration point" being the emotional state and "express frustration with AI errors" being the cause of that state.
Criteria: Participants express frustration when experiencing AI errors or limitations.
Phrase: Express frustration with AI errors.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

~~~
1.
Concepts: feedback loop, feedback integration
- Designers collect, consider, and implement user feedback.
- Designers integrate user feedback into the development process.

2.
Concepts: feedback solicitation, community feedback solicitation
- Designers ask for suggestions or feedback from users.
- Designers seek input or opinions from the community.

3.
Concepts: design rationale
- Designers explain the reasoning behind design decisions or features.
- Developers explain the intention or design philosophy behind the application.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: feedback loop, feedback integration
Relationship: Inclusion (feedback integration is a part of the feedback loop process)
Criteria: Designers collect, consider, and implement user feedback, integrating it into the development process.
Label: User Feedback Incorporation

2.
Concepts: feedback solicitation, community feedback solicitation
Relationship: Parallel (two concepts describing similar actions)
Criteria: Designers actively seek input or opinions from users or the community, asking for suggestions or feedback.
Label: Feedback Solicitation

3.
Concepts: design rationale
Relationship: N/A (single concept)
Criteria: Designers or developers provide explanations for design decisions, features, or the application's underlying philosophy.
Label: Design Transparency

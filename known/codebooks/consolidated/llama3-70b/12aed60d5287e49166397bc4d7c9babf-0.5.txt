You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: update preview
Quotes:
- Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available on the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
- Mechanics will have to wait until after electromagnetics is figured out; it will take some time
- Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it may be a bit later

2.
Label: future design plan
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, some demonstration experiments may be done based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Don't worry, it will be there, in the final optimization round of the circuit diagram.
- I hope to figure out electromagnetics before the end of the year

3.
Label: user feedback
Quotes:
- This is great, hoping it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams. Also, it would be great to have a function to hide the background grid with one click, making it easier for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no convenient software for drawing circuit diagrams for circuit-related questions.
- The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were all amazed.
- Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

Label: encouraging interaction
Quotes:
- We will also update the multimeter and powered screwdriver this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group, and we will try to consider them. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local storage is also already in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- You're welcome. If you encounter any problems during use, feel free to discuss them directly in the group.
- When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group

Quotes:
- First, pay respects to the experts, then make a small request. Can you create dynamic demonstrations of mechanical wave and vibration, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, optical experiments are desired, like optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers for demonstrating optical experiments~

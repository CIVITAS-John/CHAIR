You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

9. Designer-1: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
10. Designer-1: Although you can manually adjust the layout
11. Designer-1: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
12. User-4234: Yes, the spirit of craftsmanship that strives for perfection ðŸ¤”
13. Designer-1: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
14. Designer-1: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first
15. Designer-1: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
More realistic 3D appearance for various meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeter and meter zeroing.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments
Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal/realistic modes.

# Special Tips
The Esc shortcut key will now minimize the window.
The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation from multiple theoretical angles, I will consider the perspectives of learning sciences (how the tool supports learning physics concepts), human-computer interaction (usability and user experience), and participatory design (involving users in the design process). Some guiding questions are: How does the tool's design facilitate learning physics concepts? What usability issues or design improvements are mentioned? How are users providing feedback and being involved in the iterative design process?

Summary: The conversation revolves around the iterative development and release process for a physics simulation tool called Physics Lab. The designers share updates, release plans, and new features with users in an online community. Users provide reactions, anticipate updates, and inquire about release timelines across platforms like PC, iOS, and Android. The designers involve users through sharing prototypes, managing expectations, and incorporating user feedback. Key focuses include improving the auto-layout algorithm, adding new components and features, ensuring cross-platform availability, and providing usage guidance. The conversation highlights the collaborative and user-centered nature of the development process.

Notes: 
- The tool aims to facilitate learning physics concepts through simulations and interactive components like circuit diagrams, meters, and power sources.
- Usability and user experience are priorities, with efforts to improve auto-layout, provide manual customization options, and enhance visual realism.
- Users are actively involved in the design process through an online community, providing feedback, reactions, and feature requests.
- The development process appears to follow an agile, iterative approach with frequent updates and user testing across platforms.
- Cross-platform availability (PC, iOS, Android) is a key goal, with different release timelines for each platform.
- Hypothesis: The online community and participatory design approach contribute to the emergence of an engaged user base invested in the tool's development and learning value.

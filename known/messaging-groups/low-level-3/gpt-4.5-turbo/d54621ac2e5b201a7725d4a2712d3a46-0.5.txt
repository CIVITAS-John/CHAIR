56. P11: We don't differentiate between arts and sciences here.
57. P14: [Image 191]
58. P14: ...Let me get admitted first.
59. P2: I'm still in the second year of junior high school.
60. P11: Keep it up.
61. P13: I'm in the first year of high school.
62. P2: What about MOSFETs?
63. P2: @Designer 
64. P17: [Image 198]
65. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
66. P2: +1

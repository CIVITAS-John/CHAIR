You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: sets priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

2.
Label: suggesting the use of internal resistance simulation
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

3.
Label: the community seems to function as both a support network and a channel for user driven development
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

4.

8.
Label: explaining development plans
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

Quotes:
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

10.
Label: expressing interest in specific topics
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

11.
Label: leaves room for exploration
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

12.
Label: reiterating the bidirectional conversion concept
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

13.
Label: question
Quotes:
- Designer: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image]
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

14.
Label: mentions complexity of upcoming release
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week

15.
Label: advises categorization
Quotes:
- User: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

16.
Label: acknowledging the need for manual editing and the timeline for implementation
Quotes:
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

17.
Label: showing respect for expertise
Quotes:

18.
Label: reflects on years of teaching experience
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

19.
Label: asking for future help
Quotes:
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group

20.
Label: explaining physics focus
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

21.
Label: providing progress report
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

22.
Label: anticipates android version update for the night
Quotes:
- Designer: The Android version is expected to update tonight

23.
Label: community need
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

24.
Label: promoting inclusivity
Quotes:
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

25.
Label: which may help build trust within the community
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

26.
Label: demonstrating transparency in development process
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).

27.
Label: seeking feedback on avatar upload
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

28.
Label: build rapport
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?

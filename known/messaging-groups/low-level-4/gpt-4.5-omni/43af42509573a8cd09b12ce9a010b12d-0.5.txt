You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: describe planned feature; detail educational utility
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: express approval; provide positive feedback
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: announce future consultation; emphasize participatory design
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
Preliminary phrases: solicit feedback; engage community in design process; provide visual aid
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: confirm understanding; seek clarification; provide visual aid
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirm common standard; provide feedback
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation revolves around the development of a new feature for simulated experiment assessment in the Physics Lab online community. Designer-1 describes the planned feature and its educational utility, and User-4232 expresses approval. Designer-1 emphasizes the participatory design process by announcing future consultations and soliciting feedback from the community, particularly regarding circuit diagram standards. User-4234 provides specific feedback, leading to a discussion about the best style to use. Designer-1 provides updates on the progress, acknowledges feedback, and suggests simplifications for usability. The conversation concludes with Designer-1 expressing gratitude for the community's support, confirming an upcoming update, and managing expectations about its scope.

Notes: The conversation highlights a strong emphasis on participatory design, with designers actively seeking and incorporating feedback from the community. There is a clear focus on educational utility and usability, with designers balancing technical details and user preferences. The iterative nature of the design process is evident, with ongoing updates and improvements based on community input.

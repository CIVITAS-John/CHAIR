You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Summary of previous conversation: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community continues to revolve around a mix of user engagement, information sharing, and software functionalities. Users discuss astronomy education, software features, and share resources related to celestial simulations. The designer actively participates in the discussion, addressing user queries, providing insights into software development, and considering user feedback for future updates.
1. P14: Poverty limits my memory.
Preliminary tags: user limitation; technology use
2. P11: Check it out online, this can't be explained in a few words. @P2 
Preliminary tags: online research suggestion
3. P2: Can a motor be added? @Designer 
Preliminary tags: software customization
4. P14: I think I should stick to doing math.
5. Designer: Yes, but don't rush.
6. Designer: Ours will be simpler, more practical (closer to exams), and cheaper.
7. P11: ðŸ˜‚
8. P11: Hmm, ask the group owner.
9. Designer: After all, it's not specifically for astronomy.
10. Designer: Specialized astronomy software is good enough.
11. P2: [Image 1-144]
12. P2: As far as I know.
13. P11: How are the experimental results obtained in Physics Lab?
14. Designer: Motor simulation is quite complicated and related to the load.
15. Designer: Calculated...
16. P2: How is it calculated?
17. P11: Okay.
18. P11: Because of that rectifier last time, I naively thought it was a preset model.
19. P11: [Image 1-152]
20. Designer: It can also be understood as a preset model, but it's an atomized model.
21. Designer: Pursuing precision, a phone can't handle the calculations.
22. P1: Server?
23. P11: Hahaha.
24. Designer: Standalone.
25. P2: What if the motor is connected to AC power?
26. Designer: Two types of motors.
27. P1: Are you on the server?
28. P2: There are brush motors.
29. P2: Not brushless motors connected to AC power.
30. P14: Finally talking about something I can understand
31. P2: You don't understand brushless motors
32. P2: It's hard to make it work
33. P4: Making a motor is quite simple if you follow my method @Designer 
34. P14: [Image 1-168]
35. P2: What if it burns out?

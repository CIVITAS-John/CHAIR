Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
2. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
3. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits, so I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know, so please enlighten me in the future. Thank you.
4. P4: Has it been updated?
5. P11: It's not ideal...
6. P11: I will consider the impedance.
7. P11: Updated to the latest version.
8. P11: Thank you.
9. P12: My sister just found a group, the group owner is crazy, keeps sending red packets, hurry up and grab them at 695176754.
10. P5: 。
11. P5: @Designer

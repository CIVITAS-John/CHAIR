You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (6 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

~~~
1. emotional expressions, multimodal emotional expression.
- Instances of community members expressing emotions through language or emojis.
- Communication involving non-text elements like emojis, images, or visuals used to convey emotions or reactions.

2. technical constraints, technical and environmental constraints.
- Instances where technical limitations or constraints are discussed.
- Issues related to technical limitations and specific contexts in which the software is used.

3. iterative development, iterative design.
- Instances where the designer discusses ongoing improvements and updates to the software based on user feedback and testing.
- The exchange of feedback between users and the designer, and the designer's responsiveness to that feedback, leading to a continuous process of refining the software based on user input and testing.

4. call for feedback, feedback solicitation.
- Requests for feedback, suggestions, or input from community members.
- Instances where designers seek user feedback to refine or enhance software features or usability.

5. technical assistance, technical assistance and inquiry.
- Instances of technical help or guidance provided or received by designers or users.
- Instances involving the provision of help or the seeking of information regarding technical aspects or functionalities of the software.
- Users actively seeking information or guidance within the online community, including specific features or versions of Physics Lab.

6. user support, user assistance.
- Designers providing support and guidance to users.
- Exchanges where community members help each other solve problems or provide usage tips.

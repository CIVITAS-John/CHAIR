You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

11. P2: What's up with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
12. P2: A middle schooler is even better than you
13. P11: Just hope that ads won't take up too much of the interface
14. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
15. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method
16. P2: Oh.
17. P2: ～
18. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
19. Designer: Just asking you to watch ads for points, use points to unlock new content like this
20. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come hit me along the Ethernet cable
21. P2: I can code
22. P11: Okay!
23. P2: [Emoji 280]
24. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is too disgusting
25. P2: Indeed
26. Designer: The screen is not big, but it's still impressive.
27. P2: It even forces you to click.
28. P2: What's the purpose of the ads for you guys?
29. Designer: Health preservation...
30. Designer: Doing this requires nurturing people...
31. P1: It's free.
32. Designer: In fact, it's the same as receiving money, just that you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay.
33. P2: Oh.
34. Designer: Do more of it.
35. Designer: There are some other ways as well.
36. P8: The points wall is okay.
37. P8: I think it's okay.
38. P14: I also think it's okay.
39. Designer: Actually, you can learn from that mini-program.
40. Designer: Creating questions, reviewing questions, and answering questions.
41. P14: How do you say?
42. P14: [Image 299]
43. P17: Brainiac.
44. P18: By the way, how do you use it?
45. P18: Just downloaded it.

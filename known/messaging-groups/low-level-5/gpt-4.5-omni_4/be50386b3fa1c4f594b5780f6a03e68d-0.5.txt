1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary phrases: detailed simulated experiment assessment; explained feature specifics; linked to educational utility
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary phrases: praised idea; provided positive feedback; engaged in dialogue
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary phrases: mentioned future consultation; emphasized participatory design; engaged community in planning
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Preliminary phrases: consulted teachers on circuit diagram standards; sought expert input; engaged in participatory design
5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary phrases: provided visual example; clarified consultation; engaged in participatory design
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary phrases: confirmed common style; validated designer's example; engaged in dialogue
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation reflects a highly participatory design process where designers actively seek and incorporate feedback from the community. Designer-1 outlines plans for a new feature, emphasizing its educational utility and the need for detailed simulation assessments. Users respond positively, engaging in dialogue and providing feedback on specific design elements, such as circuit diagram styles. The designers maintain transparency about their progress and plans, consulting teachers for expert input and clarifying details through visual examples. They acknowledge and incorporate user feedback, suggesting iterative improvements and confirming update schedules. The overall tone is collaborative, with a strong emphasis on community involvement in the design process.

Notes: The participatory design approach is evident in the frequent consultations and clarifications between designers and users. There is a clear focus on educational utility and usability, with designers balancing detailed features with simplicity. The community appears engaged and invested in the development process, providing specific feedback and anticipating updates. This dynamic likely contributes to the emergence and growth of the online community, fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration. Future analysis should continue to explore how these interactions shape the platform and community over time.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (24 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
24. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

11. P11: [Image 41]
12. P11: This is a rectifier circuit.
13. P11: The verification should be correct.
14. P11: However,
15. P11: [Image 45]
16. P11: The result is not as expected.
17. P11: I'm not sure if it's a circuit issue or a software bug. Seeking advice.
18. P11: [Image 48]
19. Designer: The diode is not ideal.
20. Designer: Is there a forward voltage drop?
21. P10: I'm sorry, senior, I haven't studied physics yet. I just downloaded and played with some simple circuits. So I don't know. I don't know if other seniors know. So please enlighten me in the future if I don't understand. Thank you.
22. P4: Have you updated it?
23. P11: It's not ideal...
24. P11: I will consider the impedance.

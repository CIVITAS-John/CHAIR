You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: You can download Windows in the group files.

3.
Label: suggesting educational content
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

4.
Label: explanation
Quotes:
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

5.

10.
Label: from older xp systems to modern touch screen devices
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

11.
Label: appreciation of feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

17.
Label: explaining use case scenario
Quotes:

Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

19.

Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

22.
Label: acknowledge help
Quotes:
- User: Thank you.

23.
Label: removing idealized components
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

24.
Label: align with user needs
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: With bidirectional conversion, you can directly do problems in the application

25.
Label: describing touch screen limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

26.
Label: describes the bidirectional diagram connections
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

27.
Label: express hope for compatibility
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

28.
Label: build rapport
Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- Designer: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]
- Designer: Hello :)

29.
Label: acknowledging the workaround
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =

30.
Label: explain current focus
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

31.
Label: user friendly design in educational contexts
Quotes:
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

32.
Label: maintaining communication

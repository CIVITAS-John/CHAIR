You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not write repetitive ones.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

- That's great, I hope it can be very convenient for drawing circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for teachers to take screenshots for exam papers. Currently, there is no software that is convenient for drawing circuit diagrams for the circuit part of the exam
- We try to design it to be usable without the need for additional instructions, or we will provide some tips when you open it for the first time based on feedback
- Mainly for schools to build information technology schools

- We will also update the multimeter and energized screwdriver this week. If there are any features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message directly in the group. We will try our best to consider them. Saving experiments to the cloud/local storage, as mentioned before, is also in the plan. Thank you all!

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments

Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal and real modes.

# Special Note

The Esc key now minimizes the window.

Ctrl+E can switch between exam and normal modes.
- For the electrical side, I plan to add a simulated experiment assessment function; it will include many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, it will only be useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use regularly)
- This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, which may produce some weird results.

19.
Label: software feedback
Quotes:
- The 3D effect of your software is very good

20.
Label: software scope
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; there is not much room for free experiments in other directions before high school. In the future, based on everyone's needs, we may do some demonstration experiments, but it won't be as open as electricity

21.
Label: software expansion
Quotes:
- If the opportunity arises later, I will consider making one for chemistry as well
- I am also a bit interested in chemistry

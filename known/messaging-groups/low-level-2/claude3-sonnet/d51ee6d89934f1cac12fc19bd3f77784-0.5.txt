You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify multiple low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. Designer: I guess it's because the teacher finds it annoying when people talk too much.233
2. P1: hello
3. P4: [Image]
4. P5: 233 By the way, let's see if there are any good designs to learn from.
5. Designer: Good design?
6. P6: Like a microcomputer.
7. Designer: Let's talk about logic gates.
8. P2: The CPU of a computer is made up of logic gates.
9. P5: Hmm.
10. P5: I need logic gates for making a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
11. P6: [Image]
12. P6: [Image]
13. P7: How to play?
14. Designer: Play by conducting experiments.233
15. P8: Why suddenly add a wave?

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation, I will look for patterns and themes related to social interactions, group dynamics, and the emergence of the online community. I will focus on identifying tags that capture things like introductions, sharing information/resources, asking questions, responding to others, and any indications of community building or norms.

Analysis for all 15 messages:
1. greeting; inside-joke; setting-tone
2. introduction
3. sharing-resource
4. continuing-conversation; seeking-information
5. seeking-clarification  
6. providing-example
7. suggesting-topic
8. sharing-knowledge
9. acknowledgment 
10. stating-goal; rejecting-option
11. sharing-resource
12. sharing-resource
13. asking-question
14. instruction; inside-joke
15. asking-clarification

Summary: This conversation involves multiple participants in what seems to be an online community related to physics, design, and computing. It starts with some informal greetings and inside jokes, then moves into sharing resources like images and examples. Participants ask questions, provide knowledge, state goals, and suggest topics for discussion. There are indications of community norms like inside jokes and a playful tone. The conversation covers various topics like logic gates, CPUs, calculators, and experiments.

Notes: 
- Use of inside jokes/references (e.g. "233") suggests an established community with shared experiences
- Sharing of resources (images, examples) facilitates knowledge sharing
- Asking questions and providing knowledge indicates a willingness to learn from each other
- Suggesting topics helps guide the conversation and build shared understanding
- Stating goals and rejecting options shows individual interests while being part of the group
- Playful tone and instructions about "conducting experiments" hint at a hands-on, exploratory approach
- Diverse topics covered suggest a broad community interested in physics, design, computing, etc.

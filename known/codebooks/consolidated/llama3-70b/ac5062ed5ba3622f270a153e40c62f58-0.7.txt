You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: highlight progress
Quotes:
- Designer: The update is quite large...

2.
Label: locating resources independently
Quotes:
- User: I saw the group files, thank you.

3.
Label: designer 1 sets timeline for mechanics
Quotes:
- Designer: Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time

4.
Label: user 4232 seeks confirmation
Quotes:
- User: Win7 should be fine.

5.
Label: invite feedback
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- Designer: If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- Designer: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

6.
Label: modifying simulation components
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

7.
Label: designer 1 engages community
Quotes:
- Designer: v1.0.2 - 17/11/29
# New Features
Multi-language support: Japanese, German, French.
Preliminary support for converting circuit components to circuit diagrams.

Support for augmented reality mode on the latest iOS devices.
More realistic 3D appearance for various meters.

# Update Preview

The next version will provide multimeter and meter zeroing.

The next version will provide AC waveform display functionality.

The next version will provide capacitors and energized solenoids.

# Component Property Adjustments
Dry cells can now be ideal power sources.

All meters can now switch between ideal/realistic modes.

# Special Tips
The Esc shortcut key will now minimize the window.
The Ctrl+E shortcut key can switch between exam and normal modes.
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler
- Designer: Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

8.
Label: uploading high definition avatars
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

9.
Label: set timeline expectation
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

10.
Label: elaboration of suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa

11.
Label: acknowledge community support
Quotes:
- Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!

12.
Label: engaged in brainstorming
Quotes:
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

13.
Label: future design plan
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

- Designer: Make it simpler...

16.
Label: clarification question
Quotes:
- Designer: What problems did you encounter during use?

17.
Label: explained design priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible

18.
Label: confirm common practice
Quotes:
- User: Yes, the common one is still the old style

19.
Label: acknowledge receipt
Quotes:
- User: ok

20.
Label: followup question

Quotes:
- User: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].

22.
Label: identifying gap in existing tools
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: sharing personal experiences; providing anecdotes; illustrating technical points
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: expressing agreement; showing understanding; acknowledging designer's perspective
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: suggesting features; expressing needs; highlighting convenience; advocating for flexibility
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: promising features; setting expectations; demonstrating responsiveness
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about context; seeking clarification; understanding user needs
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: explaining constraints; describing institutional limitations; highlighting challenges
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Thoughts: In this conversation, I plan to explore how the designers and users interact and negotiate the development of Physics Lab. I will examine how the designers respond to user feedback and suggestions, and how the users provide context and constraints that shape the design. I will also consider how the designers' and users' experiences and perspectives influence the conversation. Guiding questions include: How do the designers balance user needs with technical limitations? How do the users' experiences inform the design process? What role does the online community play in shaping the development of Physics Lab?

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. P13: First year of high school
2. P2: What about MOSFETs?
3. P2: @Designer 
4. P17: [Image 1-198]
5. P14: Isn't potassium permanganate used in test tubes?
6. P2: +1
7. P17: Because the test tube is broken
8. P14: [Image 1-202]
9. P14: How do you say it?
10. P11: Test tubes are better, they heat up quickly and save materials. But this is also fine, if you're a bit extravagant, you can cover a fish tank and connect a tube ðŸ˜‚
11. P14: Won't the condensed liquid flow back?
12. P2: +1
13. P11: Because of the large volume, the liquid has already been heated during reflux, making it less likely to break
14. P14: Oh oh oh
15. Designer: The chemist probably didn't consider the equipment too much
16. P2: +1
17. P14: ...
18. Designer: But there are too many chemistry things, probably won't be able to touch it before the second half of the year..
19. P11: In fact, it's not necessary to be exactly the same as in the books, although during exams...
20. P1: There isn't any relatively realistic chemistry software at the moment
21. Designer: I remember there was a professional software that was okay
22. Designer: But even the gods of organic chemistry can't solve it
23. Designer: So if you want to do it, you still have to consider it from the exam perspective
24. P2: Oh.
25. Designer: Non-standard operations are supported, but will be marked (the next section on electricity will have it, such as charged operations)
26. P1: Hmm.
27. P11: Okay
28. P2: Oh.
29. P14: ok
30. P2: What about superconductors?
31. P11: I guess there are too many variables in chemistry experiments, so simulating them requires a larger amount of computation...
32. P1: If you have the ability to make a comprehensive and free one, it should be very popular
33. P2: If the CPU is bad, it's game over
34. P11: Adding what you said, it wouldn't be "Physics Lab" anymore ðŸ˜‚
35. P1: It's a series of lab courses
36. P11: Hey, good idea
37. P2: Hehe
38. P14: ...Don't you know that saying "hehe" is very annoying?
39. P2: @Designer Can you add a light sensor?
40. Designer: The problem is
41. Designer: Where does the light come from
42. P11: What about the light
43. Designer: Are you using a small bulb to illuminate the photoresistor?
44. P2: Tap with your hand
45. P14: I think there's no problem
46. Designer: Isn't that just a variable resistor, except the curve is different (â€¦â€¦)
47. P2: And a small light
48. Designer: Micro-payment maybe...
49. Designer: Six yuan per month = =
50. P2: ï¼Ÿ
51. P14: [Image 1-245]
52. Designer: We'll see
53. Designer: If you don't have money, you can also click on ads
54. Designer: It's the approach of a conscientious game
55. P1: Put up ads
56. Designer: Hmm.
57. P2: If you tap and release, it won't conduct electricity
58. Designer: Oh
59. Designer: Forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (â€¦â€¦)
60. P11: ðŸ˜‚
61. P11: Just about to say
62. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but that you don't know how to pay
63. P11: It can also be adapted to 3D touch
64. Designer: Just charge directly through the app store?
65. P14: Feels a bit troublesome
66. P2: â€¦â€¦
67. Designer: Now you can do it with just a fingerprint on the app store
68. P14: After all, just a middle school kid
69. Designer: That's true
70. Designer: Then just click on ads hh
71. P14: That's doable
72. P2: What's wrong with middle school [Emoji 1-268]
73. P2: Even a middle schooler is better than you
74. P11: Just hope the ads don't take up too much of the experiment interface
75. P11: Young man, you misunderstood
76. P11: He means he doesn't have a good payment method in middle school
77. P2: Oh.
78. P2: ï½ž
79. Designer: Ads won't be permanent
80. Designer: Just let you click on ads to earn points, and use points to unlock new content
81. P14: @P2 Maybe you can follow the network cable to hit me
82. P2: I can program
83. P11: Okay!
84. P2: [Emoji 1-280]
85. Designer: Permanent ad banners on iOS are really disgusting
86. P2: Indeed
87. Designer: The screen is not big and has psoriasis.
88. P2: And it forces you to click.
89. P2: What are the ads used for @Designer 
90. Designer: Health preservation...
91. Designer: Doing this requires nurturing people...
92. P1: It's not free.
93. Designer: Actually, it's the same as charging money, except you don't have money or it's inconvenient to pay.
94. P2: Oh.
95. Designer: Do a bit more.
96. Designer: There are some other ways.
97. P8: The points wall is okay.
98. P8: @Designer I think it's okay.
99. P14: I also think it's fine.
100. Designer: Actually, you can learn from that mini program.
101. Designer: Creating, reviewing, and doing questions.
102. P14: How do you say it?
103. P14: [Image 1-299]
104. P17: Brain King.
105. P18: By the way, how to use it?
106. P18: Just downloaded.
107. P19: http://url.cn/5KqUgG0?_wv=41729&_wvx=10

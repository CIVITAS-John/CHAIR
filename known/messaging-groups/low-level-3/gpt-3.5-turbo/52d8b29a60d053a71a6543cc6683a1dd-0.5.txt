You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (15 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
15. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary tags: component update; simulation feature; software development
2. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.
Preliminary tags: equipment update; ideal components; software enhancement
3. Designer: Okay. Please give me more suggestions!
Preliminary tags: community feedback; user suggestions; engagement
4. P4232: How to use the PC version?
Preliminary tags: software usage; technical support; pc version
5. P4232: [Image 19]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
6. P8: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary tags: system compatibility; technical limitation; software requirement
7. P4232: Oh, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. P4232: Can it run on Win7?
9. P8: Win7 should work.
10. P4232: Thank you.
11. P8: You're welcome. If you encounter any problems during use, feel free to discuss them directly in the group.
12. P4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to do everything and ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer: I might consider checking the compatibility with XP later... I might need to set up a virtual machine.
14. Designer: In theory, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from around 2008 onwards).
15. Designer: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, with the following updates:

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message. Tags are short phrases that can be applied across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of thoughts, plans, and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from different angles}
Tags for each message (10 in total):
1. tag1; tag2; tag3...
...
10. tag4; tag5; tag6; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

1. P4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
Preliminary tags: appreciation; community support
2. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
Preliminary tags: download inquiry; pc version; interactive whiteboard version
3. P4231: I found the files in the group, thank you.
Preliminary tags: resource location; gratitude
4. Designer: [Image 14]
Preliminary tags: image sharing
5. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary tags: component update; simulation feature
6. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.
Preliminary tags: equipment update; ideal components
7. Designer: Okay. Please give me more suggestions!
8. P4232: How to use the PC version?
9. P4232: [Image 19]
10. P8: It does not support the XP system.

Thoughts: It's important to capture various aspects of the emergence of Physics Lab's online community, including user interactions, support from the designer, updates on the software, and technical inquiries. By identifying multiple low-level tags for each message, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the community's dynamics.

Tags for each message:
1. appreciation; community support; gratitude
2. download inquiry; pc version; interactive whiteboard version; software request
3. resource location; gratitude; file discovery
4. image sharing; visual content
5. component update; simulation feature; software development
6. equipment update; ideal components; software enhancement
7. community feedback; user suggestions; engagement
8. software usage; technical support; pc version
9. image sharing; visual content; software interface
10. system compatibility; technical limitation; software requirement

Summary: The conversation in Physics Lab's online community revolves around user appreciation, support, and gratitude towards the designer. Users inquire about downloading different versions of the software, share resources, and provide feedback on updates and features. The community also engages in technical discussions, seeking support for using the software on specific systems.

Notes: The community seems to have a positive and interactive dynamic, with users actively participating in discussions and providing feedback to the designer. The emergence of the community is supported by the continuous updates and enhancements made to the software, as well as the active engagement of users in sharing resources and seeking assistance.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):

1.
Concepts: making promises, promising updates
Relationship: The concepts are related as making promises implies promising updates, and promising updates is a type of promise made by designers.
Criteria: Designers make commitments about future developments or features.
Phrase: Making promises about updates.

2.
Concepts: engaging in iterative development, iterating on design and refining features
Relationship: The concepts are related as engaging in iterative development involves iterating on design and refining features, and iterating on design and refining features is a key aspect of iterative development.
Criteria: Designers repeatedly refine and improve design features through a cyclical process.
Phrase: Iterating on design features.

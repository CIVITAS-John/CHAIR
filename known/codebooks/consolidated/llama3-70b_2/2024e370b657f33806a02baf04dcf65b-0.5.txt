You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams

27.
Label: there are unique challenges in designing for educational environments
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

28.
Label: addressed component functionality
Quotes:
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

29.
Label: explain focus areas
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (15 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
15. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary phrases: announcing changes to ideal components; explaining simulation capabilities; updating users on platform developments
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary phrases: highlighting student power supply features; explaining component capabilities; educating users about platform features
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary phrases: soliciting user feedback; encouraging participation; fostering community engagement
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary phrases: seeking guidance on platform usage; expressing confusion; requesting clarification
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary phrases: providing technical information; explaining system limitations; addressing user concerns
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

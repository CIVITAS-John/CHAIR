(interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how novices might get stuck during the human-AI collaboration process.

4.
Label: human-effort: pre-requisite knowledge
Quotes:
- E04: To me, it seems like you need to have a certain degree of expertise to understand where the errors are and how to fix them.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

1. download instructions, software download inquiries.
- Users ask questions about how to download the software.
- A user asking about how to download or access a specific version of the software.

2. participatory problem-solving, collaborative decision-making and problem solving.
- Discussions where community members engage collectively to solve a problem or improve a system aspect, demonstrating participatory design.
- Moments where decisions are made collectively with input from multiple community members or where community members work together to solve issues or propose solutions.

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Concepts: highlighting time-saving potential, recognizes ai's potential for time-constrained learners
- Participants highlight AI's time-saving potential, recognizing AI's time-saving potential.
- Participants recognize AI's potential for time-constrained learners.

2.
Concepts: experiences confusion over persistent errors, expressing frustration with unclear errors
- Participants express confusion over persistent errors despite correct code.
- Participants express frustration and experience confusion due to ambiguous error messages.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: highlighting time-saving potential, recognizes ai's potential for time-constrained learners
Relationship: The two concepts are logically related as they both emphasize the benefits of AI in terms of time efficiency, with the first concept highlighting the general time-saving potential and the second concept specifically recognizing its value for learners who are time-constrained.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge AI's ability to save time for learners, particularly those with time constraints.
Phrase: Recognizing AI's time-saving benefits.

2.
Concepts: experiences confusion over persistent errors, expressing frustration with unclear errors
Relationship: The two concepts are logically related as they both describe the negative experiences of participants when encountering errors, with the first concept focusing on the confusion caused by persistent errors and the second concept emphasizing the frustration resulting from unclear error messages.
Criteria: Participants experience confusion and frustration due to persistent and unclear errors.
Phrase: Expressing frustration with error ambiguity.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes.
Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: minimalism
Quotes:
- We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

2.
Label: school information
Quotes:
- Mainly, the school is building an information-based school

3.
Label: innovative feature
Quotes:
- For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

4.
Label: development advice
Quotes:
- Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one

5.
Label: electricity
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

6.
Label: high school curriculum
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity

7.
Label: zero adjustment
Quotes:
- For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

8.
Label: idea appreciation
Quotes:
- This idea is really good

9.
Label: textbook reference
Quotes:
- Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

Label: common notation style
Quotes:
- Yes, the common one is still the old style

13.
Label: old style notation
Quotes:
- Yes, the common one is still the old style

14.
Label: notation flexibility
Quotes:
- So, use both?

15.
Label: testing version
Quotes:
- This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

16.
Label: circuit diagram limitations
Quotes:

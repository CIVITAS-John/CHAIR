Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. P14: Except me
2. P13: ＋1
3. P15: +1 again
4. P16: ＋1
5. P10: May I ask what "+1" means?
6. P11: It means I feel the same way.
7. P13: +1 means having the same opinion
8. P13: emmmm
9. P13: You can check Baidu

* Summary
This conversation appears to be about the meaning of the phrase "+1" used in online discussions. P14 says "Except me", to which P13, P15, and P16 respond with "+1", indicating agreement. P10 then asks what "+1" means, and P11 and P13 explain that it means having the same opinion or feeling the same way. P13 also suggests checking Baidu (a Chinese search engine) for more information.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can consider the following questions and categories:

1. How is knowledge shared and constructed within this online community? 
2. What role does the technology (online messaging platform) play in facilitating communication and knowledge sharing?
3. How do participants engage in co-design or co-creation of shared norms and practices within the community?

# Knowledge Sharing and Construction
## Peer Explanation
Definition: Instances where participants explain concepts or provide information to others in the community.
- "It means I feel the same way."
- "+1 means having the same opinion"
- "You can check Baidu"

## Collective Meaning-Making
Definition: Instances where participants collectively negotiate and construct shared meanings or understandings.
- (The conversation itself, where the meaning of "+1" is collectively established)

# Role of Technology
## Affordances for Communication
Definition: Ways in which the technology affords or enables certain types of communication and interaction.
- (The online messaging platform allows for real-time, text-based communication and sharing of information)

## Constraints and Limitations
Definition: Constraints or limitations imposed by the technology that shape the communication and interaction.
- (The text-based nature of the platform may limit the richness of communication compared to face-to-face interaction)

# Participatory Design and Co-Creation
## Emergent Norms and Practices
Definition: Instances where participants co-create or establish shared norms, practices, or conventions within the community.
- (The use of "+1" as a shorthand for agreement appears to be an emergent norm or practice within this community)

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Draft Merging
* Software development
* Design influence
=> Technology design

* Concept comprehension
* Learning sciences
=> Knowledge acquisition

* Collaborative resource exchange
* Technical discussions
=> Knowledge sharing

* Group dynamics
* Group management
=> Team collaboration

* Self-perception
* Asking questions
=> User interaction

# Reflection
- More categories for merging could include "user engagement dynamics" with "community co-creation" to form a broader category related to user participation.
- No over-merged categories were identified in the draft plan.
- The naming of the categories seems accurate and aligned with the research context.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)

Thoughts: Analyzing these messages through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can explore how community norms and language evolve and how users engage with each other and the platform. The use of "+1" and the subsequent explanations highlight a learning process within the community, where members educate each other on the meanings and usage of community-specific language. This can be seen as an aspect of participatory design where users contribute to the evolving functionality and culture of the online community. From a human-computer interaction perspective, the use of external tools like Baidu suggests integration and reliance on broader internet resources, which influences how users interact with the platform and each other.

Tags for each message:
1. community agreement; reinforcement of norms; social interaction
2. community language inquiry; engagement through questioning; clarification request
3. informative response; solidarity expression; peer education
4. agreement definition; community vocabulary; peer explanation
5. hesitation expression; non-verbal communication; thought process indication
6. external resource suggestion; directing to information; self-service encouragement
7. acknowledgment of understanding; gratitude expression; resolution of inquiry
8. expression of agreement; community engagement; using community-specific language
9. indication of platform monetization; community information sharing; transactional interaction
10. intention to review; engagement with content; user interaction
11. assurance giving; supportive communication; community interaction

Summary: The conversation starts with a simple "+1" from P16, indicating agreement or support, which leads to a query from P10 about its meaning. This unfolds into a series of explanations and clarifications by P11 and P13, displaying a peer-led learning process. P13's suggestion to check Baidu for more information points to the use of external resources. The conversation also touches upon the platform's features, like monetization, as mentioned by P14. The interactions are characterized by expressions of agreement, requests for clarification, and sharing of information, illustrating how community norms are reinforced and how learning occurs within the community.

Notes: The use of "+1" and other community-specific language could be further explored to understand the development of a shared vocabulary among users. The role of external resources like Baidu in user interactions might indicate a need for better in-platform support or documentation. The mention of monetization by P14 suggests that economic factors could also influence user engagement and participation, which could be a point of interest for further research on community sustainability and growth.

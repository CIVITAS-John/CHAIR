You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (11 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...
...
11. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. P16: ï¼‹1
Preliminary tags: community engagement; agreement; social validation
2. P10: May I ask what does "+1" mean?
Preliminary tags: inquiry; seeking clarification; community norms; knowledge sharing
3. P11: It means "me too".
Preliminary tags: explanation; community norms; engagement; knowledge sharing
4. P13: +1 means the same opinion.
Preliminary tags: agreement; community norms; social validation
5. P13: emmmm
Preliminary tags: contemplation; uncertainty
6. P13: You can search on Baidu.
Preliminary tags: external resources; knowledge sharing; learning processes
7. P10: Oh, I see. Thank you.
8. P2: +1
9. P14: Some things in the beaker also need to be paid for.
10. P17: I'm just looking.
11. P4: No problem.

Thoughts: Understanding the emergence of Physics Lab's online community involves unpacking various dimensions such as community norms, engagement, knowledge sharing, social validation, and learning processes. From a learning sciences perspective, how do members acquire and share knowledge within the community? How do community norms and social validation shape interactions? In terms of human-computer interaction, how do users engage with external resources like Baidu for learning? How does the designer facilitate community engagement and agreement through features like the +1 function? 

Tags for each message:
1. community engagement; agreement; social validation
2. inquiry; seeking clarification; community norms; knowledge sharing
3. explanation; community norms; engagement; knowledge sharing
4. agreement; community norms; social validation
5. contemplation; uncertainty
6. external resources; knowledge sharing; learning processes
7. acknowledgment; appreciation
8. agreement
9. transactional information; financial aspects
10. passive engagement; observation
11. reassurance

Summary: The conversation delves into community engagement through expressions like "+1" signifying agreement and social validation. Members clarify this norm, emphasizing shared opinions and offering external resources like Baidu for learning. The interaction also touches on financial aspects within the community, passive engagement, and expressions of reassurance.

Notes: The dynamics of agreement and social validation seem central to the community's emergence, shaping interactions and reinforcing norms. The utilization of external resources like Baidu suggests a multifaceted approach to knowledge sharing within the community. The presence of financial considerations hints at potential implications for community sustainability and growth.

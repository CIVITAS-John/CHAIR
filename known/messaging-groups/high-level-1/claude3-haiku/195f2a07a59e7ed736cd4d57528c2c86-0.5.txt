Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. Designer: Probably because the teacher finds it annoying to talk too much ðŸ˜‚
2. P1: hello
3. P4: [Image 6]
4. P5: ðŸ˜‚ Just to see if there are any good designs to draw inspiration from
5. Designer: Good design?
6. P6: Like a microcomputer
7. Designer: Wait at the logic gate.
8. P2: The CPU of a computer is essentially a logic gate.
9. P5: Hmm.
10. P5: It means I need a logic gate exactly, to build a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
11. P6: [Image 14]
12. P6: [Image 15]
13. P7: How to play?
14. Designer: Play by conducting experiments ðŸ˜‚
15. P8: Why suddenly add a wave?

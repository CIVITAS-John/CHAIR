You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (5 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: share development updates, share current development
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related as designers share both current and future development plans to keep the community informed.
Criteria: Designers provide information about current and future development plans to the online community.
Phrase: Share development plans

2.
Concepts: explore design questions, share and discuss design thoughts
Relationship: The two concepts are interconnected as designers explore design questions by sharing and discussing their thoughts with the community.
Criteria: Designers engage in discussions and share thoughts about design-related issues with the online community.
Phrase: Explore design thoughts

3.
Concepts: seek context, address concerns and inquire about needs
Relationship: The three concepts are logically connected as designers seek context to address concerns and inquire about user needs.
Criteria: Designers request context, address concerns, and inquire about user needs to understand their requirements.
Phrase: Address user concerns

4.
Concepts: design refinement, designers engage in iterative development
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related as designers refine their designs through iterative development processes.
Criteria: Designers refine design elements through iterative development processes that involve feedback and testing.
Phrase: Refine design elements

5.
Concepts: establish feedback loop, plan for iterative feedback
Relationship: The two concepts are logically connected as designers establish feedback loops to plan for iterative feedback from users.
Criteria: Designers collect, consider, and implement user feedback to plan for future feedback and improvements.
Phrase: Establish feedback loops

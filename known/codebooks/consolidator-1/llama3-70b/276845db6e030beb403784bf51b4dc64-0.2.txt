You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are assigning categories to qualitative codes based on their definitions.
For each code, assign the closest category from the following list. Use "miscellaneous" if none fits.
---
* community dynamics
* community management
* design principles
* design process
* interdisciplinary thinking
* knowledge sharing
* learning environment
* online community
* physics environment
* project planning
* technical infrastructure
* technical performance
* technical support
* user demographics
* user experience
* user profile

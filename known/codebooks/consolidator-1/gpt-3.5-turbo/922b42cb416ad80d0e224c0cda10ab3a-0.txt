You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You are finding and organizing categories from existing ones. A list of initial categories and qualitative codes is provided.
Merge categories that are too specific and/or small. Split categories that are too big. Consolidate into a single level of categories.
Optimize names of the rest to be more representative. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide contexts (e.g. "social interaction" instead of "interaction", "communication approach" instead of "communication").
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Thoughts: 
There are several categories that can be merged as they are closely related, such as "communication acknowledgment" and "communication clarity" into a broader category like "communication feedback". On the other hand, categories like "community interaction" are too broad and should be split into more specific categories like "community engagement", "community moderation", and "social interaction". Additionally, some categories like "user engagement" and "user feedback" can be combined into a single category called "user interaction".

- community interaction

You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: expectation management
- A designer sets or manages expectations about a tool, feature, or update, setting or managing user expectations about the platform or its features.
- Setting realistic expectations or timelines for project completion or feature release.

2.
Concepts: design rationale
- Explaining or justifying design decisions or choices to provide context and understanding.
- Designer provides a reason or justification for a design decision or priority.

3.
Concepts: resources sharing
- A resource is shared with the community.
- Designer shares resources with the group, sharing development plans and providing resources.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: expectation management
Relationship: Inclusion (setting realistic expectations is a way to manage expectations)
Criteria: A designer sets or manages expectations about a tool, feature, or update by setting realistic timelines for project completion or feature release.
Label: Expectation Setting

2.
Concepts: design rationale
Relationship: N/A
Criteria: A designer provides a reason or justification for a design decision or priority to provide context and understanding.
Label: Justifying Design Decisions

3.
Concepts: resources sharing
Relationship: Parallel (sharing resources and development plans are two separate aspects of sharing)
Criteria: A designer shares resources, such as development plans, with the community.
Label: Resource Sharing

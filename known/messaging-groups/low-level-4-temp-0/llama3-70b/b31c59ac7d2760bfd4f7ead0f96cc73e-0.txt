You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretations for each message (15 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
...
15. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary phrases: announcing changes; explaining updates; setting new expectations
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary phrases: explaining features; highlighting capabilities; educating users
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary phrases: soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; fostering engagement
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary phrases: seeking guidance; asking for tutorials; requesting support
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary phrases: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary phrases: providing technical information; explaining limitations; setting boundaries
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on understanding the interactions between designers and users, identifying the tone and language used, and recognizing the topics discussed. I'll consider the learning sciences perspective to analyze how users are learning and being supported, the human-computer interaction perspective to examine the usability and functionality of the software, and the participatory design perspective to see how users are involved in the design process. Guiding questions include: What are the designers' roles in this online community? How do users interact with each other and the designers? What are the main topics of discussion, and how do they relate to the emergence of the online community?

Interpretations for each message:

1. announcing changes; explaining updates; setting new expectations
2. explaining features; highlighting capabilities; educating users
3. soliciting feedback; encouraging participation; fostering engagement
4. seeking guidance; asking for tutorials; requesting support
5. sharing visual content
6. providing technical information; explaining limitations; setting boundaries
7. sharing context; explaining constraints
8. suggesting alternatives; offering solutions
9. confirming compatibility; providing reassurance
10. expressing gratitude
11. encouraging open communication; promoting feedback
12. providing positive feedback; sharing user experience
13. considering future development; brainstorming solutions
14. explaining technical possibilities; setting realistic expectations
15. announcing updates; sharing release notes; informing users

Summary: The conversation revolves around the Physics Lab software, with designers announcing updates, explaining features, and soliciting feedback. Users ask questions, share their experiences, and provide suggestions. The tone is collaborative, with designers encouraging open communication and users expressing gratitude. The discussion topics include software functionality, technical limitations, and user support.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, providing guidance and support, and encouraging participation. Users are willing to share their thoughts and experiences, and the conversation is constructive and respectful. The online community seems to be emerging as a space for collaborative learning and co-design. Hypotheses include: The designers' proactive approach to user engagement may be a key factor in the emergence of the online community. The community's focus on learning and support may be driven by the users' needs and the designers' willingness to address them.

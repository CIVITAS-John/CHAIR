You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. P11: I will consider the impedance.
2. P11: Hmm, I just updated to the latest version.
3. P11: Thank you.
4. P12: My sister just found a chat group where the group owner has gone crazy and keeps sending out red packets. The group code is 695176754, everyone hurry and grab them.
5. P5: ã€‚
6. P5: @Designer 
7. Designer: Done.
8. P5: Good ðŸ˜‚
9. P8: @Designer  we need an admin here.
10. P13: Are all the members in this group top students?

Thoughts: The conversation seems to be a mix of technical discussions about a physics lab and some social interactions. The open coding will focus on identifying the low-level tags related to the social interactions, as requested.

Analysis for all 12 messages:

1. technical_discussion
2. technical_discussion
3. gratitude
4. social_interaction, group_activity
5. social_interaction
6. social_interaction, user_mention
7. social_interaction, task_completion
8. social_interaction, positive_sentiment
9. social_interaction, user_mention, request
10. social_interaction, group_membership
11. social_interaction, self-deprecation
12. social_interaction, agreement

Summary: The conversation starts with technical discussions about a physics lab, then shifts to some social interactions, including a mention of a group chat with a "crazy" group owner, a request for an admin, and a discussion about the group members. The social interactions involve user mentions, task completion, positive sentiment, group membership, and self-deprecation.

Notes: The conversation seems to have a mix of technical and social content. The social interactions appear to be casual and friendly, with some members joking and interacting with each other. The technical discussions suggest that the group is involved in a physics lab or project.

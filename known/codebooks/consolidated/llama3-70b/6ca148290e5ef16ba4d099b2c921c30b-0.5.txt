You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

16.
Label: listing featuer updates and bug fixes
Quotes:
- # New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a brief process, rather than immediately. 
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface. 
Support for undoing wire connections, component creation, and deletion. 
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current. 
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key. 

# New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter. 
Added a student power supply (AC/DC ideal power supply). 

# Adjustment of Component Properties
Dry cells now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources. 
Incandescent light bulbs now have voltage-current characteristics parameters and are no longer ideal resistors. 
The resistor law experiment now uses real formulas for calculation with adjustable parameters. 
Hidden terminals 3 and 4. 

# Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue caused by unit conversion when editing properties in the editor. 
Terminal arrows no longer display jumping animations. 
There may be calculation errors in certain circuit connections.

You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: engaging in community conversation
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

2.
Label: expressing tentative commitment
Quotes:
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

3.
Label: providing theoretical context
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

4.
Label: seeking software download instructions
Quotes:
- User: How to download?

5.
Label: explaining common school policies
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

6.
Label: seeking clarification on the placement of the circuit diagram
Quotes:
- Designer: Uh... left side or right side

7.
Label: confirms update schedule for different platforms
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.

8.
Label: considering future expansions
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later

9.
Label: transparency
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

10.
Label: consider hardware limitations
Quotes:
- User: It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.

11.
Label: reacting lightheartedly
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

12.
Label: shows commitment to user driven design
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be.

13.
Label: requesting tutorials or instructions
Quotes:
- User: How do you use the PC version?

14.
Label: propose potential solution
Quotes:
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

15.
Label: promoting user engagement
Quotes:
- Designer: Group sharing.

16.
Label: seeking attention
Quotes:
- User: Excuse me.

17.
Label: sets boundaries
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: It does not support the XP system.

18.
Label: seeking assistance with avatar customization
Quotes:
- Designer: @Morning Tea Moonlight How can I upload a high-definition, uncensored version of this crappy avatar?

19.
Label: recognizing limitation in previous statement
Quotes:
- Designer: But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

20.
Label: considering implementation constraints
Quotes:
- Designer: Does the class have internet?

21.
Label: seeking clarification on availability
Quotes:
- User: PC version?

22.
Label: identity inquiry
Quotes:
- Designer: I'll upload one now... Are you a teacher?

23.
Label: inquires about downloading pc/interactive whiteboard version of physics lab
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?

24.
Label: planning for simulation details
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

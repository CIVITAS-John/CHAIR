Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

# Label of category 1

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

* Summary
The conversation involves users and a designer discussing the features and future updates of the Physics Lab application. User-4230 requests additional demonstrations for mechanical waves and optical experiments. Designer-1 outlines the current development priorities and plans to gather more feedback before starting on mechanics. User-4231 inquires about downloading the application and finds the information in the group files. Designer-1 also shares updates about upcoming changes to the simulation components.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation, we can examine it from multiple theoretical angles: learning sciences to understand the educational value, human-computer interaction to assess usability and user engagement, and participatory design to see how user feedback influences development. Guiding questions could include: How do users' requests shape the development priorities? What role does feedback play in refining features? How do designers communicate updates and gather opinions?

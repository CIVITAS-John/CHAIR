You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
Group each code into a theory-informed category. Use 2-4 words for categories to provide general contexts.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

Label: invite feedback
Quotes:
- If you have any suggestions or requirements, feel free to bring them up.
- Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need
- What problems did you encounter during use?

2.
Label: developer response
Quotes:
- Hmm... I'll add it in the next update. PC updates are usually the fastest, so there will probably be another round this weekend.
- Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

3.
Label: progress update
Quotes:
- There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
- I saw the group files, thank you.
- The update is quite large...

4.
Label: feature request
Quotes:
- First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions
- If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

- We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

Label: update preview
Quotes:
- Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Mechanics will have to wait until electromagnetism is figured out; it will take some more time
- Of course, manual editing will also be allowed, but it might be a bit later

11.
Label: future design plan
Quotes:
- Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

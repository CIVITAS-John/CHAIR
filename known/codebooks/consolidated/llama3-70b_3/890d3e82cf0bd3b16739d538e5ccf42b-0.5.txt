You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (3 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: critically evaluate ai output, critically evaluates ai responses
Relationship: The concepts are closely related, as critically evaluating AI output implies assessing the responses generated by the AI.
Criteria: Participants critically assess the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated outputs and responses.
Phrase: Critically evaluate AI outputs

2.
Concepts: valuing easy-to-read code, value code simplicity and clarity
Relationship: The concepts are complementary, as valuing easy-to-read code implies a preference for simplicity and clarity in coding and documentation.
Criteria: Participants prioritize code readability, simplicity, and clarity in generated code and documentation.
Phrase: Value code simplicity

3.
Concepts: seeking ai guidance
Relationship: N/A, as the concept is a single idea.
Criteria: Participants ask for or propose AI assistance to facilitate their work or answer questions.
Phrase: Seek AI guidance

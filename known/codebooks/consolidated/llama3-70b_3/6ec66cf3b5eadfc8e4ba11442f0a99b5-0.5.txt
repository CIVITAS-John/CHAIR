You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

~~~
1.
Concepts: critiques ai limitations, discusses ai limitations
- Participants critique AI limitations and note and highlight AI limitations.
- The participant discusses AI limitations, highlighting potential misinformation or wrong directions in AI-driven learning.

2.
Concepts: ai promptness, preferring immediate ai feedback
- Highlights the promptness of AI in providing immediate feedback.
- Participants value and prefer immediate feedback from AI-driven interfaces over delayed responses.

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: critiques ai limitations, discusses ai limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve expressing negative aspects of AI, with "critiques" implying a more evaluative tone and "discusses" implying a more neutral or descriptive tone.
Criteria: Participants identify and articulate limitations of AI-driven learning interfaces.
Phrase: Identifying AI limitations

2.
Concepts: ai promptness, preferring immediate ai feedback
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both involve the timeliness of AI feedback, with "ai promptness" referring to the speed of feedback and "preferring immediate ai feedback" referring to the user's preference for such promptness.
Criteria: Participants value and expect rapid feedback from AI-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Preferring immediate feedback

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each item with verb phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use ";" to separate verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Interpretation phrases for each item (10 in total):
1. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
...
10. {phrase 1}; {phrase 2}; {phrase 3}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. 4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
Preliminary phrases: sharing professional experience; providing context; building rapport
2. 3: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
Preliminary phrases: providing update information; setting expectations; managing anticipation
3. 3: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
Preliminary phrases: apologizing for disturbance; showing consideration; being polite
4. 4233: How to download?
Preliminary phrases: seeking guidance; asking for instructions; expressing confusion
5. 4233: Excuse me.
Preliminary phrases: seeking clarification; expressing politeness; being courteous
6. 8: Group sharing.
Preliminary phrases: suggesting feature idea; proposing collaboration; highlighting group needs
7. 3: You can download Windows in the group files.
8. 3: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
9. 4234: [Emoji 2-56]
10. 4232: [Emoji 2-57][Emoji 2-57]

Thoughts: In this initial round of coding, I'll focus on understanding the context and intents behind each message. I'll consider how the designers and users are interacting, what information is being shared, and what features are being discussed. I'll also look for signs of community building, such as rapport-building and politeness. From a learning sciences perspective, I'll examine how users are seeking guidance and clarification. From a human-computer interaction perspective, I'll analyze how the designers are managing user expectations and providing updates. From a participatory design perspective, I'll investigate how users are contributing to the development process.

Interpretation phrases for each item:

1. sharing professional experience; providing context; building rapport;
2. providing update information; setting expectations; managing anticipation;
3. apologizing for disturbance; showing consideration; being polite;
4. seeking guidance; asking for instructions; expressing confusion;
5. seeking clarification; expressing politeness; being courteous;
6. suggesting feature idea; proposing collaboration; highlighting group needs;
7. providing solution; offering assistance; clarifying process;
8. providing roadmap; soliciting feedback; setting priorities;
9. expressing excitement; showing enthusiasm; building community;
10. expressing playfulness; building rapport; creating lighthearted atmosphere;

Summary: The conversation is centered around the development and release of Physics Lab, with the designers providing updates and managing user expectations. Users are seeking guidance and clarification, while also contributing to the development process by suggesting feature ideas. The tone is polite and considerate, with a focus on building rapport and community.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, providing updates and soliciting feedback. Users are enthusiastic about the project and are willing to contribute to its development. The use of emojis and polite language suggests a friendly and welcoming community. I'll continue to explore these themes in future rounds of coding.

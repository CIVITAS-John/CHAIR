You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).

4.
Label: providing reassurance of intuitive interface
Quotes:
- Designer: We try to design it so that it can be used without additional instructions, or we will provide some prompts when you open it for the first time based on feedback

7.
Label: community need
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

13.
Label: defining the scope of physics lab

19.
Label: managing limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

20.
Label: if there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. we could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class

23.
Label: providing development timeline
Quotes:
- Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
- Designer: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
- Designer: Hope to figure out electromagnetism before the end of the year

24.
Label: seeking information
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- User: Has the Android version not been updated yet?
- User: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji]
- User: Are there any other updates recently?

25.
Label: internal update
Quotes:

Quotes:
- User: [Emoji][Emoji]

27.
Label: sharing expertise
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
- User: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
- User: Left side

28.
Label: identifying development priorities
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

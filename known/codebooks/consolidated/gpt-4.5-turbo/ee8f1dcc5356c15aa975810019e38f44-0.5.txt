You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging
* Category g
* Category h
=> Category i

* Category j
* Category k
=> Category l

# Reflection
- **More categories for merging:** Currently, the merging seems adequate without overcomplicating or oversimplifying the categories. The existing merges cover broad yet distinct aspects of the research question.
- **Over-merged categories:** The category "administrative and technical management" might seem a bit broad, combining various aspects of management and technology updates. However, it reflects the administrative and technical aspects that are crucial for the functioning of an online community.
- **Naming inaccuracies:** The names chosen seem to accurately reflect the contents of the merged categories. However, "digital communication tools" could be more specific to indicate it includes tools and resources.

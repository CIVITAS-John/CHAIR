You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes.
Quotes are independent of each other. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
If necessary, refine labels to keep contexts, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: gratitude
Quotes:
- This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
- No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
- Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.

2.
Label: context
Quotes:
- Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
- Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji].
- I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

3.
Label: technical issue
Quotes:
- Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.

4.
Label: offering/seeking alternative

- We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!
- No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.

7.
Label: community feedback
Quotes:
- If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
- It is recommended to add an exit button function to the PC version. Many regions now use all-in-one touch screen machines without physical keyboards.
- This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.

8.
Label: positive
Quotes:

10.
Label: transparent developer discussion*
Quotes:
- Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?
- But you can't bring it up without touching the input, that's probably the case.

11.
Label: seeking context
Quotes:
- Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
- What problems did you encounter during use?
- Does the class have internet?

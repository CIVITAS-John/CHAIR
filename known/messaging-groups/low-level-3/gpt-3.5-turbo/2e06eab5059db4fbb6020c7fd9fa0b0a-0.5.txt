You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

1. Designer: It's the practice of a conscientious game.
Preliminary tags: ethical game design practices
2. P1: Let's put up some ads.
Preliminary tags: user suggestion for ad revenue
3. Designer: Hmm.
Preliminary tags: acknowledgment of suggestion
4. P2: It won't conduct electricity when you touch it lightly.
5. Designer: Oh.
6. Designer: Let's forget about the pressure-sensitive resistor (......).
7. P11: 23333
8. P11: I was just about to say.
9. P14: Sometimes it's not that the fee is too high, but we simply don't know how to top up.
10. P11: It could also be adapted for 3D Touch.
11. Designer: Can we just top up directly on the app store?
12. P14: It seems a bit troublesome.
13. P2: ……
14. Designer: You can just use fingerprint on the app store now.
15. P14: After all, I'm just a middle school student.
16. Designer: That's true.
17. Designer: Let's just click on ads, hh.
18. P14: Yes, that's fine.
19. P2: What's wrong with middle schoolers [Emoji 268]
20. P2: A middle schooler is better than you.
21. P11: I just hope that ads won't take up too much space on the interface.
22. P11: Young man, you misunderstood.
23. P11: He meant he's in middle school and doesn't have a good payment method.
24. P2: Oh.
25. P2: ～
26. Designer: The ads won't be permanent.
27. Designer: We just want you to click on ads to earn points, and then use the points to unlock new content.
28. P14: @P2 Maybe you can come and hit me along the network cable.
29. P2: I know how to code.
30. P11: Okay!
31. P2: [Emoji 280]
32. Designer: The constant presence of ads banners on iOS is really annoying.
33. P2: Indeed
34. Designer: The screen isn't big and it's still got psoriasis.
35. P2: It even forces you to click.

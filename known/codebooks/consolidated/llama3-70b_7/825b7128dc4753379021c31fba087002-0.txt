You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

1.
Concepts: notes incomplete ai responses, notes ai's input limitations
- Participants note AI's limitations in fixing errors.
- Participants discuss AI limitations in handling large code pieces.

2.
Concepts: appreciates ai's context inference abilities, appreciates clear ai explanations and parameter clarification
- Participants appreciate AI's ability to infer context and understand their needs.
- Participants appreciate clear AI-generated explanations and parameter clarification.

3.
Concepts: prioritizes efficiency, saves time and increases efficiency
- Participants prioritize efficiency and value the time-saving benefits of AI-driven interfaces.
- Participants perceive AI-driven interfaces as saving time and increasing efficiency in learning and problem-solving.

4.
Concepts: value feedback from ai, values feedback from ai
- Participants value immediate and incremental feedback from AI-driven interfaces.
- Participants suggest a feedback loop for AI improvement and value user feedback, and value AI feedback and suggestions for improving code or learning.

Here are the definitions for each code:

---
1.
Concepts: notes incomplete ai responses, notes ai's input limitations
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the limitations of AI-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants identify and discuss the limitations of AI-driven interfaces in terms of incomplete responses and input limitations.
Phrase: Identifying AI limitations.

2.
Concepts: appreciates ai's context inference abilities, appreciates clear ai explanations and parameter clarification
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the strengths of AI-driven interfaces in understanding user needs and providing clear explanations.
Criteria: Participants appreciate AI-driven interfaces for their ability to infer context and provide clear explanations and parameter clarification.
Phrase: Appreciating AI strengths.

3.
Concepts: prioritizes efficiency, saves time and increases efficiency
Relationship: The concepts are related as they both describe the benefits of AI-driven interfaces in terms of time and efficiency.
Criteria: Participants prioritize efficiency and value the time-saving benefits of AI-driven interfaces in learning and problem-solving.
Phrase: Valuing efficiency gains.

4.
Concepts: value feedback from ai, values feedback from ai
Relationship: N/A (the concepts are identical)
Criteria: Participants value immediate and incremental feedback from AI-driven interfaces, and suggest a feedback loop for AI improvement.
Phrase: Valuing AI feedback.

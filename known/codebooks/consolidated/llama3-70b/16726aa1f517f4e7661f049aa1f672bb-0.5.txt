You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another and please do not merge them.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts within each code, such as inclusion, parallel, or intersection.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details. Then, write an accurate label for the combined concept.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}

1.
Concepts: user experience sharing, user perspective and sentiment
- Discussion of user experience or history with software, sharing of personal experiences or anecdotes.
- Expressing user preferences or opinions, and user's emotional response or opinion about the software.

2.
Concepts: technical limitations, technological limitations and barriers
- User discusses limitations related to a platform, system, or tool.
- Users discuss infrastructure, institutional, or technological barriers to using the platform.

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: user experience sharing, user perspective, sentiment
Relationship: Intersection (user experience sharing and user perspective intersect to reveal sentiment)
Criteria: Users share their personal experiences or opinions about the software, expressing their emotional responses or opinions.
Label: User-Centric Feedback

2.
Concepts: technical limitations, technological limitations, barriers
Relationship: Inclusion (technological limitations are a type of barrier)
Criteria: Users discuss limitations or obstacles related to the platform, system, or tool, including infrastructure or institutional barriers.
Label: Technical Constraints

You are an expert in thematic analysis. Now, you are working on the open coding.
This conversation comes from Physics Lab's online messaging groups. The goal is to identify low-level tags of each message with a focus on social interactions.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?

1. Designer: I guess it's because the teacher finds it annoying when people talk too much.233
2. P1: hello
3. P4: [Image]
4. P5: 233 By the way, let's see if there are any good designs to learn from.
5. Designer: Good design?
6. P6: Like a microcomputer.
7. Designer: Let's talk about logic gates.
8. P2: The CPU of a computer is made up of logic gates.
9. P5: Hmm.
10. P5: I need logic gates for making a calculator, don't want to use Minecraft.
11. P6: [Image]
12. P6: [Image]
13. P7: How to play?
14. Designer: Play by conducting experiments.233
15. P8: Why suddenly add a wave?

Thoughts: To analyze this conversation for social interactions and the emergence of the Physics Lab online community, I will look for tags related to greetings, questions, sharing information or resources, expressions of interest or confusion, and attempts to guide or direct the conversation. I'll also note any indications of the group's purpose or norms.

Analysis for all 15 messages:
1. humor, off-topic
2. greeting
3. sharing-resource
4. continuing-conversation, seeking-information  
5. seeking-clarification
6. sharing-information
7. suggesting-topic
8. sharing-information
9. expressing-uncertainty
10. stating-goal, rejecting-option
11. sharing-resource
12. sharing-resource
13. asking-question
14. humor, suggesting-approach
15. expressing-confusion

Summary: The conversation starts with some off-topic humor, then moves to sharing images and information related to computer hardware and logic gates. There are attempts to steer the discussion towards specific topics like logic gate design. Some participants express uncertainty or ask clarifying questions, while others state their goals or reject certain approaches. Overall, there seems to be an interest in learning about computer components and logic through experimentation and discussion.

Notes: While there is not a clearly defined purpose stated, the conversation suggests an interest in learning about computer hardware, logic gates, and potentially building simple computing devices. The tone is relatively casual, with some humor mixed in. Participants share resources like images and seem open to exploring different topics within this general domain. There are no strong indications of rigid community norms, but also no major conflicts - participants seem to go along with conversation shifts reasonably well.

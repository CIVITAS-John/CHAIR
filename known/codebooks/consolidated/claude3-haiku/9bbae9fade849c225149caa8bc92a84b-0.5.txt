You are an expert in thematic analysis. 
Each code is a cluster of multiple qualitative sub-code. First, determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each merged code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
Find a theory-informed category for each code. Use 2-4 words for categories and avoid over-generalization.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Categories: 
* {Name some categories you identified from the research question and theoretical lens}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
Category: {2-4 words for code 1}

1. teacher feedback, designer responsiveness.
- The level of involvement and feedback from the teacher in the design process.
- The designer's responsiveness to the teacher's needs and suggestions.

2. designer's openness to feedback, responsive to community.
- The designer's openness to suggestions and feedback from the community.
- The designers demonstrate responsiveness to the community's needs and feedback, and are committed to improving the tool.

Categories: 
* Participatory Design
* Community Responsiveness

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. Teacher Involvement
Relationship: The first input includes two related concepts - teacher feedback and designer responsiveness. The teacher feedback is a broader concept that includes the designer's responsiveness to the teacher's needs and suggestions.
Criteria: The level of involvement and feedback from the teacher in the design process, including the designer's responsiveness to the teacher's needs and suggestions.
Label: Teacher Involvement
Category: Participatory Design

2. Community-Centered Design
Relationship: The second input includes two parallel concepts - the designer's openness to feedback and their responsiveness to the community. Both concepts are important in understanding how the community emerged and shaped the design.
Criteria: The designer's openness to suggestions and feedback from the community, and their demonstrated responsiveness to the community's needs and feedback, with a commitment to improving the tool.
Label: Community-Centered Design
Category: Community Responsiveness

Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

## ...
~~~
1. P4230: First, let's pay tribute to the experts, then I have a small request. Can you make a dynamic demonstration of mechanical wave and mechanical vibration, such as the propagation of transverse waves and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, I really hope to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, polarizers, etc., to demonstrate optical experiments~
2. Designer: Hmm... We should prioritize completing the electricity section first, then move on to magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember.
4. P4230: Okay okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. P4231: [Emoji 12] Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?
6. P4231: I saw the files in the group, thank you.
7. Designer: [Image 14]
8. Designer: Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer: The student power supply supports both direct current and alternating current, and is an ideal component.

Here is a codebook with examples from the interaction to analyze factors that could contribute to understanding how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

---
## Community Needs and Requests (CNR)
Definition: Comments or suggestions from community members expressing needs, desired features or improvements for the software/platform.
- "Can you make a dynamic demonstration of mechanical wave and mechanical vibration, such as the propagation of transverse waves and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, wave diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, I really hope to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, polarizers, etc., to demonstrate optical experiments~"
- "Hello everyone, where can I download the Physics Lab for PC/interactive electronic whiteboard version?"

## Developer Responses (DR)  
Definition: Responses from the designer/developer addressing community needs, explaining plans, or providing updates.
- "Hmm... We should prioritize completing the electricity section first, then move on to magnetism, and then other parts."
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember."
- "Starting from the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate)."

## Community Appreciation (CA)
Definition: Expressions of gratitude or appreciation from community members towards the designer/developer.
- "Okay okay~ Thank you for your hard work."
- "I saw the files in the group, thank you."

## Visual Aids (VA)
Definition: Use of images, diagrams or other visual elements to communicate ideas or updates.

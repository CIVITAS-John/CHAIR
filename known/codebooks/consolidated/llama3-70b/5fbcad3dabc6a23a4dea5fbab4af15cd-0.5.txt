You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes a list of concepts and definitions. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Determine the logical relationship between concepts. If a concept includes another, use the broader one. If concepts are parallel, try to cover both concepts.
Write clear and generalizable labels and criteria for each code, informed by the context, and without unnecessary specifics or examples.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1. {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 1}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 1}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 1}
...
4. {Repeat the input 4}
Relationship: {The logical relationship between concepts in input 4}
Criteria: {A sentence of consolidated criteria for code 4}
Label: {A consolidated label of code 4}

Definitions for each code:

1. school infrastructure, technical infrastructure
Relationship: Hierarchical (technical infrastructure is a type of school infrastructure)
Criteria: References to resources or equipment available in educational settings.
Label: Educational Resources

2. community knowledge and expertise, shared knowledge and knowledge sharing
Relationship: Overlapping (community knowledge and expertise includes shared knowledge and knowledge sharing)
Criteria: Instances of sharing, referencing, or recognizing collective knowledge or expertise within the community.
Label: Collective Knowledge

3. teacher consultation, seeking consultation and expert input
Relationship: Parallel (teacher consultation and seeking consultation are related but distinct concepts)
Criteria: Requests for input, feedback, or advice from teachers or experts.
Label: Expert Input

4. physics concepts, educational content
Relationship: Hierarchical (physics concepts are a type of educational content)
Criteria: References to specific physics principles, concepts, or topics discussed within the Physics Lab online community.
Label: Physics Content

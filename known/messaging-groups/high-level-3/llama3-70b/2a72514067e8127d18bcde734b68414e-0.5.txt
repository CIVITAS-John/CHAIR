You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
* Summary
{A summary of the conversation}

* Plan
{A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}

1. User-4230: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.
2. Designer-1: Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts.
3. Designer-1: Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything.
4. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
5. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
6. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
7. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
8. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
9. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

Here is a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research on how Physics Lab's online community emerged:

---
* Summary
The conversation revolves around user requests and designer responses, showcasing the collaborative and iterative nature of the Physics Lab online community. Users provide feedback and suggestions, while designers share their plans and updates.

* Plan
This conversation will be analyzed through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. Guiding questions include: How do users and designers interact and influence each other? What role does feedback play in shaping the development of Physics Lab? How do designers prioritize and respond to user requests?

# Co-Creation
## Soliciting Feedback
Definition: Designers actively seek input from users to inform the development of Physics Lab.

- "Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations..." (User-4230)

## Responding to Requests
Definition: Designers acknowledge and address user requests, demonstrating a commitment to user-centered design.
- "Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts." (Designer-1)
- "Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work." (User-4230)

# Resource Sharing
## Providing Information
Definition: Designers share updates, resources, and knowledge with users, fostering a sense of community and transparency.
- "[Image 2-14]" (Designer-1)
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components..." (Designer-1)

## Accessing Resources
Definition: Users seek and access resources, such as downloads and group files, to support their learning and engagement with Physics Lab.
- "Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?" (User-4231)
- "I saw the group files, thank you." (User-4231)

# Prioritization
## Setting Priorities
Definition: Designers establish priorities for the development of Physics Lab, balancing user requests with technical and resource constraints.
- "Hmm... We will probably prioritize completing the electrical section first, then magnetism, and then other parts." (Designer-1)

## Managing Expectations
Definition: Designers communicate their priorities and timelines to users, managing expectations and building trust.
- "Before starting mechanics, we will gather opinions again~ Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't remember everything." (Designer-1)

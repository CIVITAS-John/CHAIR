1.
Label: finds error messages misleading
Quotes:
- E04: maybe you saw something that I didn't, but from my perspective, it seemed as though the code was set up appropriately, but it was marking the syntax as wrong. So maybe I was missing something, but I didn't see anything missing. So that was kind of frustrating. (interviewer's observation) Shows error messages even when it seems to be correct (that's a bug identified)

2.
Label: values efficiency in model building
Quotes:
- E04: I really liked how, like the code that it generates, if you could just kind of place that into the model automatically.  (interviewer's observation) The capability to put into the model automatically.

3.
Label: acknowledge current advantages of ai
Quotes:
- E01: It's like, I could hire an intern to like do this, or I could have chat GPT do it much faster for free. And, and, and even if chat GPT doesn't do it today, I bet six months from now, it would do it. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT is free and advances fast.

4.
Label: reflects limited experience with ai versions
Quotes:
- E04: I don't know if I've ever tried 4. I guess it would be 3.5. (interviewer's observation) Only used ChatGPT 3.5 before

5.
Label: emphasize importance of maintainable code
Quotes:
- E01: I don't want chat GPT to write 27 operations in one line and show how brilliant it is. I wanted to separate out the code and, and it did a good job of not only did it write the code, but it commented the code. And then in addition to commenting the code externally, it did documentation. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT tends to provide comments and documentation. Generated code is easy to read.
- E01: You know, so in point of fact, I considered a much higher virtue for that kind of code to go, write this in the most standard dumb ass idiot accessible way that you can. So that when I come back to it later, I could figure out why it, why it's not working anymore. (interviewer's observation) Discussion on code complexity & quality. Plain / not-tricky code's advantage in maintenance.

6.
Label: share humorous reaction to ai error
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 laughs when he sees ChatGPT making a classical error.

7.
Label: suggests system reminders
Quotes:
- E01: Depending on what you do and how busy you are and the higher ranking people are, the more busy they are, the longer it is between sessions. So you make some notes on little yellow, sticky cinnamon. And then you go back to your administrator job for two months, and then some other project comes up. And then six months later, you come back. Okay, now, where was I? (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on how professionals learn - they learn in fragments, in fragmented time blocks and need support from the system to remind them where they were.

8.
Label: highlights need for fine tuning
Quotes:
- E04: Part of the issue that I'm having now is just kind of like the learning curve, just trying to figure out how everything works. (interviewer's observation) E04 mentions a learning curve, likely because our current design is not fine-tuned for experts.

9.
Label: notes ai's speed in identifying issues
Quotes:
- E01: And I posted that into chat GPT and it analyzed it in 10 seconds and said, well, it does this, this, and this, and here, these eight things are wrong. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT could be used to provide timely feedback.

10.
Label: expresses a specific goal for model creation
Quotes:
- E04: The typical idea that I had was like a very, very simple neural network. (interviewer's observation) Task: a very simple neural network

11.
Label: highlights a need for improvement
Quotes:
- E04: And then like the only other thing I didn't like was, you know, kind of how it was getting stuck on itself and it wasn't able to fix that one error. (interviewer's observation) Could get stuck in a loop and cannot fix that.

12.
Label: familiar with earlier ai versions
Quotes:
- E04: I don't know if I've ever tried 4. I guess it would be 3.5. (interviewer's observation) Only used ChatGPT 3.5 before

13.
Label: implies need for thorough validation
Quotes:
- E01: "can you verify that no more names are reserved words in NetLogo?" I don't know if it can do that. (interviewer's observation) When E01 sees a bug after the third iteration, he asks ChatGPT to verify the code and produce no more bug. Unsure if it could do that.

14.
Label: reflect on novice struggles
Quotes:
- E01: I'm not sure that any beginner wouldn't necessarily know that unless they'd ever practiced. And so some of the users of NetLogo have never programmed anything. So, (they might lack) the whole concept of debugging or maybe starting with a design outline. They start typing and then they get frustrated because they don't know how to debug code. (interviewer's observation) E01 reflects on how novices might get stuck during the human-AI collaboration process.
- E01: I mean, it's like, write a line of code. Are there any errors? But, beginners will start and they write three pages of code and then they hit the green check mark.  (interviewer's observation) Beginners could write chunks of code and then find many errors that they cannot fix.
- E01: Part of this, the user needs a little practice in debugging their own code. There should be some exercises before you ask GPT to do this.  (interviewer's observation) Users need practice in debugging their own code and need to have exercises before asking AI.

15.
Label: seeks confirmation of ai's capabilities
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a neural network" - I want to see if it actually pulls up the model. (interviewer's observation) E04 experiments with the AI to see what phrases could give a correct search result.

16.
Label: describes expert's fragmented learning
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the, one of the things which I have observed, as I'm bouncing from like, because I do a lot of different languages and potentially, so I don't have that much time to spend in anyone. (interviewer's observation) As an expert, E01 knows many languages but does not have much time for each one.

17.
Label: integrates ai suggestions cautiously
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) Again, he reads the code and selectively copies code to the model.

18.
Label: emphasize continuous improvement
Quotes:
- E01: So one of the things that certainly about ChatGPT is, or whatever the AI tool is that you build, is that it will probably always be advancing, and always stay pretty close to the state of the art about all these things. So if it has, especially if it has a hive business, so that if any user discovers something, they can feed it back into the system. And then everybody knows it now. (interviewer's observation) AI could be used to preserve, process, and retrieve fragmented knowledge generated by human as a collaboration process.

19.
Label: describes busy professionals' learning habits
Quotes:
- E01: Depending on what you do and how busy you are and the higher ranking people are, the more busy they are, the longer it is between sessions. So you make some notes on little yellow, sticky cinnamon. And then you go back to your administrator job for two months, and then some other project comes up. And then six months later, you come back. Okay, now, where was I? (interviewer's observation) E01's reflection on how professionals learn - they learn in fragments, in fragmented time blocks and need support from the system to remind them where they were.

20.
Label: envisions a hive feedback system for knowledge sharing
Quotes:
- E01: I call it hive feedback system, where if anyone in the world learns a new fact, or like, Oh, if you're a nurse, here's the word. If you're a transcriptionist, here's the word. If anybody learns it, then it goes into the system into the cloud. And now the cloud won't make that mistake anymore. And then the developer doesn't have to solve all these problems, because all the users solve their own problems. (interviewer's observation) E01 discusses how the human-AI collaborative system could be used to increase general productivity.

21.
Label: engages with ai feedback
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 reads error messages before making a choice.

22.
Label: human-effort (negative): time constraint
Quotes:
- E01: The problem I posted was about 100 pages of NetLogo and then 100 pages, 100 lines of NetLogo. And it was a real problem that I had looked at. I would love to help this person, but this is going to take me minimum of two hours to figure out what are they trying to do? (interviewer's observation) Although AI made mistake, E01 still believes in the value in having an AI-generated solution (compared with no solution or no help).
- E01: There's a lot of extensions I would love to know about GIS extensions, but I have very limited time. What could I do in two hours? And I think everybody has a very finite length of time. (interviewer's observation) AI could potentially save time for learning new extensions (compared with core concepts) of NetLogo.

23.
Label: does not always seek ai assistance
Quotes:
- E04: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E04 reads through the code and tries to debug with himself when the generated code does not do what it does.

24.
Label: capacity
Quotes:
- E01: It's about, let's see, what did I count is 3800 lines of code. Well, first I couldn't feed it all the ChatGPT can only take it 1800 lines at a time. And then I said, you know, can you tell me what this does? And it basically said, no. ... I can live with that again. (interviewer's observation) ChatGPT's limitation on reading long code pieces.

25.
Label: prefers not to copy paste directly
Quotes:
- E04: (Throughout this phase. He uses generated code only for reference when writing his own.) (interviewer's observation) E04 writes code manually with the steps given by ChatGPT, rather than copy & paste code.

26.
Label: advocates for pair programming
Quotes:
- E01: I'm an advocate of peer programming. It's about 10 times more efficient than single programming... If a person's programming, if you're programming it by yourself and you come to something you don't understand, you could spend a long time at that stoplight. (interviewer's observation) E01's positive opinions on peer programming with a hint that AI could play the role.

27.
Label: simplifies tasks to regain momentum
Quotes:
- E04: "Draw a smiley face" / "Drawing on the canvas" (interviewer's observation) E04 switches to a simpler task.

28.
Label: reflects on learning opportunities
Quotes:
- E01: This is what conversations with ChatGPT typically look like. I had to go through about eight separate times to get all the errors out of it.  But, but look at how it structured the code. Look at the things that did look what you could learn from this. This is valuable. (interviewer's observation) Users may benefit from the iterative debugging process during working with AI, even though AI might give wrong answers.

29.
Label: refines query approach
Quotes:
- E04: "I want to create a simple perception" (interviewer's observation) Thinks a bit about whether to use "in NetLogo" or not.

30.
Label: suggests summarizing tool
Quotes:
- E01: Let's suppose that I'm trying to debug this error and I have trouble and I can't figure it out. So my next step would be to go to the user group. So if I had a button here that said please explain my situation so that I can paste it to the user group. User is attempting to write this. This is the code I wrote. This is the error it generates that the user doesn't understand. Can any human figure out what's wrong? I just press a button and it says, okay, paste it to the user group and we're done. And it's hard for users. (interviewer's observation) E01 suggests that AI could potentially help users write "help" posts that summarizes the situation: the need, the code, the error that the user does not understand.

31.
Label: seeks ai guidance on visualization
Quotes:
- E04: "how can I plot the output of this model?" (interviewer's observation) E04 was prompted to follow-up with ChatGPT.

32.
Label: notes decision to fix problem
Quotes:
- E01: (no verbal response) (interviewer's observation) E01 chooses to fix the problem rather than showing the explanation.

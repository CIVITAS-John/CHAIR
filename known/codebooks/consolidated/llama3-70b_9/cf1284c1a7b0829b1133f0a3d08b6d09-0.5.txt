You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

4.
Label: ensuring user understanding
Quotes:
- Designer: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa

5.
Label: emphasizing the long term benefits of the feature
Quotes:
- Designer: This belongs to the kind of feature that, once done, will ensure long-term stability... Adding various components is actually simpler

6.
Label: compliment on the 3d effect
Quotes:
- User: The 3D effect of your software is very good

7.
Label: share teaching experience
Quotes:
- User: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.

9.
Label: transparency
Quotes:
- Designer: This is quite complex, so it will take more time... Hopefully, it can be released this week
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.

10.
Label: announced upcoming update
Quotes:
- Designer: We will also update the multimeter and powered solenoid this week. If there are any other features, characteristics, or electronic components you hope to include in the production plan, please leave a message in the group, and we will consider it as much as possible. The previously mentioned feature of saving experiments to the cloud/local is also in the plan. Thank you, everyone!

Label: shares image teaser for upcoming updates
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] Updates in preparation

12.
Label: highlighting the importance of zero adjustment
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)

13.

22.
Label: confirm role
Quotes:
- User: Yes.

23.
Label: showing respect for expertise
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

24.
Label: introducing versatile components
Quotes:
- Designer: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.

25.
Label: acknowledging the limitations of the auto layout algorithm
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

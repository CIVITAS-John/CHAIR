You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Summary of previous conversation: This conversation reveals an online community centered around Physics Lab, where designers and users interact, share ideas, and provide feedback. The designers are actively engaging with users, soliciting feedback, and announcing updates. Users are requesting features, sharing their experiences, and complimenting the design. The conversation is characterized by a collaborative and participatory tone, with both parties working together to shape the development of Physics Lab.
1. Designer-1: For example, see the circuit diagram to connect the physical diagram, or vice versa
Preliminary phrases: explaining functionality; providing examples
2. User-4232: Don't aim for completeness, it should be categorized and refined one by one
Preliminary phrases: advising incremental development; promoting refinement
3. Designer-1: Hmm.
Preliminary phrases: contemplating feedback; considering suggestions
4. Designer-1: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
5. User-4232: Indeed
6. Designer-1: I myself have some interest in chemistry
7. Designer-1: We'll see if there's a suitable opportunity to do one later
8. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
9. User-4232: This idea is really good
10. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
11. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?
[Image 2-91]
12. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
13. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style

Thoughts: In this round of open coding, I will focus on capturing the actions, intentions, and interactions between designers and users in the Physics Lab online community. I will analyze the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will explore how the designers and users collaborate, share ideas, and provide feedback to shape the development of Physics Lab.

Interpretations for each message:

1. explaining functionality; providing examples
2. advising incremental development; promoting refinement
3. contemplating feedback; considering suggestions
4. clarifying scope; defining focus areas
5. expressing agreement; acknowledging perspective
6. sharing personal interest; revealing motivation
7. considering future possibilities; exploring opportunities
8. outlining future development; detailing planned features
9. expressing enthusiasm; appreciating idea
10. promising inclusive decision-making; involving users
11. soliciting feedback; consulting users
12. seeking confirmation; clarifying understanding
13. confirming common practice; sharing experience

Summary: The conversation continues to reveal a collaborative and participatory tone, with designers and users working together to shape the development of Physics Lab. Designers are actively engaging with users, soliciting feedback, and outlining future development plans. Users are providing feedback, sharing their experiences, and expressing enthusiasm for new ideas. The conversation is characterized by a sense of mutual respect and a shared goal of creating a valuable resource for physics education.

Notes: The designers seem to be genuinely interested in user feedback and are actively incorporating it into their development plans. The users, in turn, are invested in the development process and are providing constructive feedback. The conversation suggests that the online community is playing a crucial role in shaping the development of Physics Lab.

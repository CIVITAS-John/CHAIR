You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

Label: private messaging
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

2.
Label: noting for potential bugs
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

3.
Label: resource request
Quotes:
- User: [Emoji] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
- User: Need the user manual for this software
- User: Is there a user manual?

4.
Label: share info about future development plan
Quotes:
- Designer: Physics mainly focuses on electricity and mechanics; other directions don't have much room for free experiments before high school. In the future, we might do some demonstration experiments based on everyone's needs, but it won't be as open as electricity
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
- Designer: I myself have some interest in chemistry

5.
Label: ask followup question on user request
Quotes:
- Designer: Oh, please message me privately and tell me what you roughly need

6.
Label: humor

Label: transparent developer discussion*
Quotes:
- Designer: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
- Designer: Speaking of which, doesn't that mean every place where numbers are input should have a soft keyboard?

- Designer: Touch screens have their own on-screen keyboards.

9.
Label: suggest new feature
Quotes:
- User: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
Preliminary codes: ** component update**: designer 1 announces that dry batteries will no longer be ideal components in the next update; allowing users to simulate by removing internal resistance
2. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
Preliminary codes: ** component introduction**: designer 1 introduces the student power supply; an ideal component that supports both dc and ac
3. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
Preliminary codes: ** call for feedback**: designer 1 encourages users to provide more suggestions
4. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
Preliminary codes: ** usage inquiry**: user 4232 asks about using the pc version
5. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
Preliminary codes: image sharing
6. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.
Preliminary codes: ** system limitation**: designer 2 mentions that the platform does not support the xp system
7. User-4232: Dizzy, the computer system for teachers at our school is quite old.
8. User-4232: Win7 should be fine.
9. Designer-2: 7 is okay.
10. User-4232: Thank you.
11. Designer-2: No need to be polite, if you encounter any problems during use, you can directly mention them in the group.
12. User-4232: This software is great! It's quite practical, unlike some software that tries to be comprehensive but ends up being inconvenient to use.
13. Designer-1: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.
14. Designer-1: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
15. Designer-1: Hello everyone~ Version 1.01 has been released in the group files, the updates are as follows:

Thoughts: In this conversation, I aim to identify the designers' intentions, users' needs, and the community's dynamics. I'll explore how the designers engage with users, gather feedback, and respond to concerns. I'll also examine how users interact with each other and the designers, and what they expect from the platform.

Codes for each message:

1. **component update**: designer 1 announces that dry batteries will no longer be ideal components in the next update; allowing users to simulate by removing internal resistance
2. **component introduction**: designer 1 introduces the student power supply; an ideal component that supports both dc and ac
3. **call for feedback**: designer 1 encourages users to provide more suggestions
4. **usage inquiry**: user 4232 asks about using the pc version
5. **image sharing**: user 4232 shares an image
6. **system limitation**: designer 2 mentions that the platform does not support the xp system
7. **system description**: user 4232 describes the computer system at their school
8. **system compatibility**: user 4232 suggests that Win7 should be fine
9. **confirmation**: designer 2 confirms that Win7 is okay
10. **gratitude**: user 4232 thanks designer 2
11. **feedback encouragement**: designer 2 invites user 4232 to report any problems
12. **positive feedback**: user 4232 praises the software for being practical and user-friendly
13. **future development**: designer 1 considers looking into xp compatibility
14. **theoretical compatibility**: designer 1 explains that the platform should be compatible with newer machines
15. **version update announcement**: designer 1 announces the release of version 1.01 and lists the updates

Summary: The conversation revolves around the designers' engagement with users, addressing technical issues, and gathering feedback. The designers introduce new components, respond to user inquiries, and consider user suggestions. Users share their experiences, ask questions, and provide positive feedback.

Notes: It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, encouraging feedback, and responding to concerns. The users are interested in using the platform and providing suggestions for improvement. The conversation highlights the importance of system compatibility and user experience.

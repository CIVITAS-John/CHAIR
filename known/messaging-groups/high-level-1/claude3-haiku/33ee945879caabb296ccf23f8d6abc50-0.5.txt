Hi ChatGPT, I want to analyze the following interaction in one of Physics Lab's online message groups.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
For each code, try to find 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:
---
## Label of code 1
Definition: A definition of code 1
- Example quote 1
- Example quote 2

1. Designer: I tried it in junior high last time, now there's a clever way to do it, just click the link button on the top right, after the browser pops up, it won't be in full screen anymore... = =
2. P4232: @Designer Yes, that's right.
3. P4232: If there could be an export function, or save and import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set the parameters in the office and import them directly in class.
4. Designer: It will be available.
5. Designer: Is there a network in the classroom?
6. P4232: Generally not, since one time during a city-level open class, an adult image popped up, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 41].
7. Designer: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer: Looks like we need to support local export now.
9. P4232: Most schools will shut down the network of classroom computers to prevent students from going online, or to prevent various software downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer: Mm-hmm.
11. P4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were all amazed.
12. Designer: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. P4232: I taught high school for seven years first, and now I have been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to be available in the Apple market in one or two days (pending review).
15. Designer: Sorry for the midnight rooster crowing :)
16. P4233: How can I download it?
17. P4233: Excuse me.
18. P8: Shared in the group.

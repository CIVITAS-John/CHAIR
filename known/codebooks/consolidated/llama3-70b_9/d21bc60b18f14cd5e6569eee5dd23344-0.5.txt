You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:

Definitions for each code (4 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code:

1.
Concepts: envisioning human-ai collaboration, envisioning a collaborative human-ai system
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as envisioning human-AI collaboration implies a system that facilitates this collaboration.
Criteria: Participants discuss and describe a system that enables human-AI collaboration for knowledge sharing and problem-solving.
Phrase: Envision collaborative human-AI systems.

2.
Concepts: acknowledging ai's effectiveness and expressing satisfaction, noting ai's efficiency, using it for quick analysis, and appreciating timely assistance
Relationship: The concepts are interconnected, as acknowledging AI's effectiveness and expressing satisfaction are a result of noting its efficiency and appreciating its timely assistance.
Criteria: Participants acknowledge and appreciate AI's performance, using it for quick analysis and timely assistance.
Phrase: Acknowledge AI's effectiveness.

3.
Concepts: help-seeking, seek online help
Relationship: The two concepts are synonymous, as help-seeking implies seeking help online.
Criteria: Participants engage with online communities and AI systems to seek help and support.
Phrase: Seek online help.

4.
Concepts: reflects on interface complexity, reflecting on the effort and learning curve of llm-driven interfaces
Relationship: The two concepts are closely related, as reflecting on interface complexity implies considering the effort and learning curve required to use LLM-driven interfaces.
Criteria: Participants reflect on the learning curve and effort required to learn and use LLM-driven interfaces.
Phrase: Reflect on interface complexity.

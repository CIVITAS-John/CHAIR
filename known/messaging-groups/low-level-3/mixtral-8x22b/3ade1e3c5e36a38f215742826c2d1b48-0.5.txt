You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

1. Designer-1: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
Preliminary tags: development plan; user engagement; participatory design
2. User-4232: This idea is really good
Preliminary tags: user engagement; participatory design
3. Designer-1: When we are ready to start, we will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary tags: user engagement; participatory design
4. Designer-1: Consulting the teachers in the group: which type of intersection is used in the circuit diagrams in the current textbooks?

5. Designer-1: [Image 2-92] This one, right?
Preliminary tags: user engagement; participatory design; learning sciences
6. User-4234: Yes, the common one is still the old style
Preliminary tags: user engagement; participatory design; learning sciences
7. Designer-1: Uh... left side or right side
8. Designer-1: We are working on this part
9. User-4234: Left side
10. Designer-1: Okay.
11. Designer-1: Make it simpler...
12. User-4234: But it's better to use the right side for non-crossing
13. Designer-1: So, use both?
14. Designer-1: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
15. Designer-1: [Image 2-102]
16. Designer-1: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. User-4234: Will there be an update this week? [Emoji 2-104]
18. Designer-1: There will be an update. Submitting to the app store / releasing the Android version next Monday, and releasing the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer-1: The update is quite large...

Summary: The conversation begins with Designer-1 outlining plans for an electricity simulation feature, including a function for simulated experiment assessment. The designer engages users in the design process, asking for input on circuit diagrams used in textbooks and their preferred style. Users provide feedback, and the designer acknowledges their support and shares update plans for different platforms.

Notes: The conversation highlights the importance of participatory design in the development of Physics Lab's online community. The designers actively seek user input, which contributes to the emergence of the community. The focus on learning sciences is evident in the discussion around circuit diagrams, which are a crucial aspect of physics education. The conversation also touches on human-computer interaction, particularly in the context of the auto-layout algorithm and its stability.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Tags for each message (11 in total):
1. tag 1; tag 2; tag 3...

11. tag 4; tag 5; tag 6...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}

Thoughts: When analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles, consider how social interactions are forming within the community, how users are engaging with each other and with the designer, and how language understanding and communication play a role in building a shared understanding. Additionally, explore how users support each other and share external resources, as well as how community members express uncertainty and seek clarification. 

Tags for each message:
1. social interaction; agreement; community participation
2. language understanding; communication clarification; user inquiry
3. language understanding; communication explanation; user engagement
4. social interaction; agreement; community engagement
5. hesitation; uncertainty; information sharing
6. information sharing; external resource suggestion; user support
7. gratitude; acknowledgment
8. agreement; social interaction
9. transactional information; financial responsibility
10. exploration; browsing
11. reassurance; acknowledgment

Summary: The conversation shows instances of social interaction, agreement, and community participation through expressions like "+1" to indicate agreement and understanding. Users seek clarification and provide explanations to enhance language understanding and communication within the community. There are also moments of uncertainty, information sharing, and external resource suggestions, along with expressions of gratitude and acknowledgment towards each other and the designer.

Notes: The community members are actively engaging with each other, supporting one another, and demonstrating a willingness to share knowledge and resources. The language used in the conversation plays a crucial role in shaping the shared understanding within the community. The designer's presence is minimal in this conversation, but their influence on community dynamics could be further explored in future analyses.

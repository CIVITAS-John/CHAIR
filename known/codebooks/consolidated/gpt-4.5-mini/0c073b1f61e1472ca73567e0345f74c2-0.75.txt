You are an expert in thematic analysis. You are giving labels and definitions for qualitative codes.
Each code includes one or more concepts and definitions. Each code is independent of another. Never attempt to merge them.
For each code, reflect on the logical relationship between the concepts.
Then, write a combined sentence of criteria covering all the concepts. Use clear and generalizable language and do not introduce unnecessary details. 
Finally, write an accurate verb phrase to best represent the code.
The research question is: In the context of NetLogo learning and practice: What perceptions - strengths, weaknesses, and adoption plans - do interviewees perceive LLM-driven interfaces? How do they use it to support their work? What are their needs for LLM-based interfaces?
Always follow the output format:
---
Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1.
Concepts: {Repeat the input 1}
Relationship: {What is logical relationship between concepts in code 1, or N/A if not applicable}
Criteria: {Who did what, and how for code 1}
Phrase: {The most representative verb phrase for the concepts}

Definitions for each code (2 in total):
1. 
Concepts: recognizes limitations of ai, acknowledges ai's constraints
Relationship: Both concepts emphasize the awareness of interviewees regarding the shortcomings of AI, highlighting a critical understanding of its capabilities and the iterative learning process involved.
Criteria: Interviewees acknowledged AI's limitations and recognized the need for iterative learning from AI-generated outputs.
Phrase: Acknowledge AI's limitations

2. 
Concepts: typical use case, sample use case
Relationship: The concepts represent both general and specific applications of AI, illustrating how users typically engage with AI in coding tasks and providing concrete examples of its usage.
Criteria: Users described common AI use cases in coding tasks and shared specific examples of troubleshooting processes.
Phrase: Describe AI's use cases

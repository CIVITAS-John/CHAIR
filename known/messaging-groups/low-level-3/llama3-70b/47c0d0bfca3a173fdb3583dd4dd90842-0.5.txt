You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each meessages with low-level codes.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents with codes. 
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:
---
Thoughts: {A paragraph of plans and guiding questions about analyzing the conversation from multiple theoretical angles}
Codes for each message (18 in total):
1. {an interpretation of message 1}
...
18. {an interpretation of message 18}; ...
Summary: {A somehow detailed summary of the conversation, including previous ones}
Notes: {Notes and hypotheses about the conversation until now}
~~~
1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary codes: **personal anecdote**: designer 1 shares a personal experience with on screen keyboards
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary codes: **agreement**: user 4232 agrees with designer 1
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary codes: **feature request**: user 4232 suggests adding an export function or the ability to save or import experiments
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary codes: **promise of future feature**: designer 1 promises to add the feature
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary codes: **query about internet access**: designer 1 asks if the class has internet
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary codes: **internet access limitation**: user 4232 explains that the school has disabled the network on classroom computers due to a past incident
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Thoughts: 
For this initial round of coding, I will focus on understanding the context and intent behind each message. I will explore the conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design. I will examine how the designers and users interact, what features are being discussed, and how the online community is emerging. 

Codes for each message:

1. **personal anecdote**: Designer-1 shares a personal experience with on-screen keyboards.
2. **agreement**: User-4232 agrees with Designer-1.
3. **feature request**: User-4232 suggests adding an export function or the ability to save or import experiments.
4. **promise of future feature**: Designer-1 promises to add the feature.
5. **query about internet access**: Designer-1 asks if the class has internet.
6. **internet access limitation**: User-4232 explains that the school has disabled the network on classroom computers due to a past incident.
7. **amusement**: Designer-1 reacts with laughter to the incident.
8. **recognition of need**: Designer-1 acknowledges the need for local export support.
9. **explanation of common practice**: User-4232 explains that many schools disable internet access on classroom computers.
10. **acknowledgment**: Designer-1 acknowledges User-4232's explanation.
11. **positive feedback**: User-4232 praises the simulation effect of the software.
12. **query about profession**: Designer-1 asks about User-4232's profession.
13. **professional background**: User-4232 shares their teaching experience.
14. **update on software development**: Designer-1 shares the status of the software's development.
15. **apology**: Designer-1 apologizes for any late-night disturbance.
16. **query about download**: User-4233 asks how to download the software.
17. **polite expression**: User-4233 excuses themselves.
18. **idea suggestion**: Designer-2 suggests group sharing.

Summary: 
The conversation starts with Designer-1 sharing a personal experience and User-4232 agreeing. The discussion then shifts to feature requests, with User-4232 suggesting an export function and Designer-1 promising to add it. The conversation also touches on internet access limitations in schools and the need for local export support. User-4232 praises the software's simulation effect, and Designer-1 asks about their profession. The conversation concludes with Designer-2 suggesting group sharing.

Notes: 
It appears that the designers are actively engaging with users, gathering feedback, and promising to add features. The users are providing valuable insights into their experiences with the software and suggesting new features. The conversation is informal and friendly, with a sense of community emerging. I hypothesize that the designers are using this online community to gather feedback and iterate on their software development.

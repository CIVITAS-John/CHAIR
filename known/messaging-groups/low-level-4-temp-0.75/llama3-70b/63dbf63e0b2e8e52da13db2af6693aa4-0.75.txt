You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
This is the first round of coding. Your goal is to describe each messages with phrases.
Try your best to interpret events, contexts, and intents. Always use verb phrases.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Always follow the output format:

1. Designer-1: Last time I tried it in middle school, there's a trick where you click the link button in the top right, and when the browser pops up, it's no longer full screen... = =
Preliminary phrases: sharing personal experience; illustrating technical workarounds
2. User-4232: @Designer-1 Yes, yes.
Preliminary phrases: expressing agreement; validating design concerns
3. User-4232: If there could be an export function, or the ability to save or import experiments, it would be convenient. We could set up the parameters in the office and directly import them in class.
Preliminary phrases: requesting new functionality; highlighting workflow efficiency
4. Designer-1: There will be.
Preliminary phrases: promising future development; addressing user needs
5. Designer-1: Does the class have internet?
Preliminary phrases: inquiring about classroom infrastructure; assessing implementation feasibility
6. User-4232: Generally not. Ever since an adult image popped up during a major city-level open class, the school has disabled the network on classroom computers [Emoji 2-41].
Preliminary phrases: explaining classroom constraints; highlighting the importance of offline functionality
7. Designer-1: ðŸ˜‚
8. Designer-1: It seems that local export needs to be supported.
9. User-4232: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.
10. Designer-1: Hmm hmm.
11. User-4232: The simulation effect of this software is really good. When I used it in class yesterday, the students were amazed.
12. Designer-1: Haha. Are you a middle school or high school teacher?
13. User-4232: I taught high school for seven years, and now I've been teaching middle school for eight years.
14. Designer-1: Version 1.0.1 of Physics Lab. It is expected to take another one or two days in the Apple market (waiting for review).
15. Designer-1: Sorry for the late-night disturbance :)
16. User-4233: How to download?
17. User-4233: Excuse me.
18. Designer-2: Group sharing.

Thoughts: 
As we begin open coding, I'll focus on capturing the essence of each message while considering the research question, "How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?" Through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, I'll analyze the conversation to identify initial patterns and themes. I'll pay attention to how designers and users interact, share ideas, and address concerns, which may reveal the community's emergence.

Interpretations for each message:
1. sharing personal experience; illustrating technical workarounds
2. expressing agreement; validating design concerns
3. requesting new functionality; highlighting workflow efficiency
4. promising future development; addressing user needs
5. inquiring about classroom infrastructure; assessing implementation feasibility
6. explaining classroom constraints; highlighting the importance of offline functionality
7. expressing amusement
8. identifying development priority
9. providing context for classroom constraints
10. acknowledging user input
11. sharing positive user experience; highlighting software impact
12. inquiring about user background; establishing rapport
13. sharing professional background; building trust
14. providing software update; setting expectations
15. apologizing for notification timing
16. seeking guidance on software download
17. apologizing for interrupting
18. suggesting new feature idea; exploring collaboration potential

Summary: 
This conversation revolves around the Physics Lab online community's early stages. Designer-1 and users (User-4232 and User-4233) engage in discussions about the software's functionality, limitations, and potential improvements. Topics include technical workarounds, feature requests, and classroom infrastructure constraints. The conversation also touches on the software's impact on students and the importance of offline functionality. Meanwhile, Designer-2 introduces the idea of group sharing, which might become a crucial aspect of the community's development.

Notes: 
From this initial round of coding, it appears that the Physics Lab online community is emerging through open discussions between designers and users. The conversation is characterized by a sense of collaboration, with users providing feedback and designers responding to their concerns. The community's focus on addressing real-world classroom challenges and improving the software's functionality may be a driving force behind its emergence. I hypothesize that the community's participatory design approach will continue to shape its development and growth.

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Please give me a codebook to analyze factors within this interaction that could contribute to the research.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.
Always use verb phrases. For each phrase, try to find at least 3 quotes. Always follow the output format:

1. User-4230: Okay, okay~ Thank you for your hard work.
2. User-4231: [Emoji 2-12] Hello everyone, may I ask where I can download the PC / interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab?
3. User-4231: I saw the group files, thank you.
4. Designer-1: [Image 2-14]
5. Designer-1: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
6. Designer-1: The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component.
7. Designer-1: Okay. Please give more suggestions!
8. User-4232: How do you use the PC version?
9. User-4232: [Image 2-19]
10. Designer-2: It does not support the XP system.

* Summary
This conversation involves users asking about downloading and using the PC/interactive whiteboard version of Physics Lab, as well as designers providing information about upcoming updates and system requirements.

* Plan
To analyze this conversation through the lenses of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design, we can explore themes related to:

1. User experience and usability of the software across platforms
2. Community engagement and support for users
3. Iterative design process and incorporating user feedback
4. Affordances and constraints of the software for learning physics

## Providing system requirements
Definition: Designers clarifying the system requirements or limitations of different software versions
- "It does not support the XP system."

## Sharing visuals for clarity
Definition: Users and designers using images or visuals to illustrate their points
- "[Image 2-14]"
- "[Image 2-19]"

# Community Engagement
## Acknowledging user contributions 
Definition: Designers expressing appreciation for user feedback and suggestions
- "Okay. Please give more suggestions!"

## Providing updates and roadmap
Definition: Designers informing users about upcoming changes or new features
- "From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate)."
- "The student power supply supports both DC and AC and is an ideal component."

# Iterative Design
## Incorporating user feedback
Definition: Designers indicating changes based on user feedback or suggestions

You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
Your goal is to identify multiple low-level tags for each message.
When writing tags, balance between specifics and generalizability across messages. For example, "design discussion" is better than "discussion", "seeking guidance" is better than "guidance", while "questions about circuits" is better than "questions about diodes".
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" is the person who designed and developed Physics Lab.

Always follow the output format:

~~~
1. Designer: For electricity, planning to create a simulated experimental assessment function; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it will be troublesome to use normally)
Preliminary tags: software feature development; experimental assessment function; user centered design
2. P4232: This is a really good idea
Preliminary tags: positive feedback; user appreciation
3. Designer: When ready to do it, I will consult everyone in the group
Preliminary tags: user engagement; collaborative decision making
4. Designer: I would like to ask the teachers in the group: which type is used for the intersections on the circuit diagram in the textbook?

Preliminary tags: user inquiry; technical clarification; circuit diagram conventions
5. Designer: [Image 92]This one.
Preliminary tags: visual aid reference
6. P4234: Yes, the common one is the old-fashioned type.
Preliminary tags: technical agreement; circuit diagram conventions discussion
7. Designer: Um... left or right?
8. Designer: We are working on this.
9. P4234: Left side.
10. Designer: Okay.
11. Designer: Keep it simple...
12. P4234: But it's better to use the right side without crossing.
13. Designer: So, should we use both?
14. Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor, because the automatic layout algorithm is not very stable yet, and may produce some weird results.
15. Designer: [Image 102]
16. Designer: Thank you all for your support. We will do better!
17. P4234: Will there be updates this week? [Emoji 104]
18. Designer: There will be updates. Submit to the app store / release the Android version next Monday, and release the Windows version over the weekend.
19. Designer: The update is quite substantial...

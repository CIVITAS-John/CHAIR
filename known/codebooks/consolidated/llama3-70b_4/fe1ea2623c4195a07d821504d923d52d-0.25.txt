You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

1.
Label: feature adjustment
Quotes:
- Designer: It seems that local export needs to be supported.

2.
Label: describe educational needs
Quotes:
- User: First, let's pay homage to the experts, then I'll make a small request. Could you create a dynamic demonstration of mechanical waves and mechanical vibrations, such as the propagation of transverse and longitudinal waves, wave superposition, diffraction, and interference? Also, for optical experiments, it would be great to have optical benches, single slits, double slits, and polarizers to demonstrate optical experiments.

3.
Label: adapt to platform specific constraints
Quotes:
- Designer: The Apple Store is still reviewing, let's upload the PC version first

4.
Label: explaining new features
Quotes:
- Designer: Don't worry, don't worry, it will come, just optimizing the circuit diagram one last time.
- Designer: It's still better to make the auto-generated one as good as possible
- Designer: Although you can manually adjust the layout

5.
Label: explain current limitations
Quotes:
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results

6.
Label: offering solution
Quotes:
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).
- Designer: XP compatibility might need to be looked into later... probably need to install a virtual machine.

7.
Label: user guidance
Quotes:
- Designer: New Features
Electronic components will be damaged after a short process, rather than immediately.
Clearing the desktop will now display a confirmation interface.
Supports undoing the creation and deletion of wires and components.
Appliances now display the effective value of alternating current.
(PC) You can now exit the application using the Esc key.

New Components
Added a sensitive ammeter.
Added a student power supply (ideal AC/DC power supply).

Adjustments to Component Properties
Batteries now have adjustable internal resistance and are no longer ideal power sources.
Incandescent bulbs now have volt-ampere characteristic parameters and are no longer ideal resistors.
The resistance law experimenter now uses real formulas for calculations, with adjustable parameters.
Hidden terminal blocks 3 and 4.

Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue with unit conversion in Editor properties.
Terminal arrows no longer show jumping animations.
There may have been calculation errors with certain circuit connections.
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
- Designer: From the next update, dry batteries will no longer be ideal components (you can remove the internal resistance to simulate).
- Designer: Theoretically, it should be compatible (but the machine itself shouldn't be too old, probably from 2008 onwards).

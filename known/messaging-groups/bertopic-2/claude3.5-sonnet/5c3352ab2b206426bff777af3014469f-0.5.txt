You are an expert in thematic analysis with grounded theory, working on open coding.
You identified a topic from the input quotes. Each quote is independent from another.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
"Designer" refer to people who designed and developed Physics Lab. Code through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design.

Quotes:
- Designer: Actually, we are researching the bidirectional conversion between physical diagrams and circuit diagrams
- Designer: For example, you can see the corresponding circuit diagram after connecting the physical diagram, or vice versa
- Designer: This version of the circuit diagram is for testing only... You can drag the Editor because the auto-layout algorithm is not very stable and may produce some odd results
Keywords: diagrams, diagram, designer, circuit, layout

Thought: The quotes consistently discuss the development and functionality of different types of diagrams within Physics Lab, particularly focusing on the relationship between physical and circuit diagrams. The designers are working on features that allow users to interact with and convert between these diagram types.

Phrase: Developing diagram conversion features

You are an expert in thematic analysis.
You will identify input categories that can be merged into another. Find as many as possible. Prioritize merging smaller categories. Avoid creating huge categories. Names of new categories must concisely cover the aspects and stay in the research context.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge? (through the lens of learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and participatory design)
Always follow the output format:
---
# Draft Merging
* Category a
* Category b
=> Category c

* Category d
* Category e
=> Category f
...

# Reflection
Answer the following questions with detailed examples:
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
- Is any naming inaccurate?
Improve the draft plan into the final merging plan in the next section, following the same format.

# Final Merging

* Category h
=> Category i

# Reflection
- Can you identify more categories for merging?
Yes, categories 1, 11, and 16 could be merged into a new category "Learning Processes" as they all relate to learning and cognitive processes.

- Can you identify over-merged categories that should be split?
Category "Social Learning Strategies" might be too broad and could be split into two categories: "Self-Regulated Learning" and "Social Interactions".

- Is any naming inaccurate?
The name "Emotional and Risk Factors" might be misleading, as it combines two distinct concepts. It could be renamed to "Emotional Responses" and "Risk Factors" could be merged with "Online Risk Behaviors" into a new category "Risk and Safety".

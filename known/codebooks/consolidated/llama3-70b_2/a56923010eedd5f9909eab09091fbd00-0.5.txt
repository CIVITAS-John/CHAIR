You are an expert in thematic analysis clarifying the criteria of qualitative codes. Do not attempt to merge codes now.
Consider provided quotes, and note that each quote is independent of others.
Write clear and generalizable criteria for each code and do not introduce unnecessary details.
If necessary, refine labels to be more accurate, but do not repeat yourself.
The research question is: How did Physics Lab's online community emerge?
Always follow the output format:

2.
Label: sought additional resources
Quotes:
- User: Is there a user manual?

3.
Label: addressed technical concerns
Quotes:

4.
Label: used non verbal affirmation
Quotes:
- Designer: Hmm hmm.

5.
Label: explain common practice in schools
Quotes:
- User: Most schools will disable the network on classroom computers to prevent students from going online or to avoid various software auto-downloads from slowing down the computers.

6.

10.
Label: reassure user
Quotes:

- Designer: There will be.

11.
Label: user 4232 suggests features
Quotes:
- User: This is good, I hope it can be very convenient to draw circuit diagrams, and I also hope there is a function to hide the background grid with one click, which is convenient for us teachers to take screenshots for test papers. Currently, there is no software that makes it easy to draw circuit diagrams for exam questions

12.
Label: inform users
Quotes:
- Designer: There will be: multimeter; powered solenoid; semiconductor capacitor; support for conversion to ideal ammeter (more convenient for problem-solving and middle school teaching)

13.
Label: designer 2 acknowledges user suggestion
Quotes:
- Designer: 7 is okay.

14.
Label: planned detailed simulated experiment assessment

15.
Label: shared visual reference
Quotes:
- Designer: [Image] This one, right?

16.
Label: linked to opportunity

Quotes:
- Designer: Hello everyone~ The development plan and PC download address are in the group announcement.

30.
Label: development goals
Quotes:
- Designer: For electricity, we plan to create a function for simulated experiment assessment; it will add many experimental details, such as zero adjustment (of course, only useful in specific modes, otherwise it would be cumbersome to use regularly)
